<h3>Classes to start Monday (Saturday, Sept. 15 at 1:30 p.m.)</h3>

                        <p>After being canceled beginning Wednesday at 5:00 p.m., classes will resume Monday morning. Duke's severe weather policy status will expire at 7:00 a.m. Sunday as well, according to the most recent updates from Duke's <a href="http://emergency.duke.edu/" target="_blank">emergency notification website</a>. Raleigh-Durham International Airport did not sustain any damage and is open.</p>
<p>The Marine Lab, however, will not be starting back so soon. The lab, which is located in Beaufort along North Carolina's coast, will not re-open to students and non-essential employees until Friday, Sept. 21. The lab was evacuated last week in preparation for the then-hurricane to batter the N.C. coast.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Florence downs some trees on Duke's campus (Saturday, Sept. 15 at 11:30 a.m.)</h3>
<p>As rain picked up Friday night, Florence brought down some trees and caused localized flooding on Duke's campus. The updates on Duke's <a href="http://emergency.duke.edu" target="_blank">emergency page</a> state that the main effects Duke has felt from the storm so far are localized flooding, downed trees and scattered power outages.</p>
<p>According to a Friday night update, some campus thoroughfares had been covered in standing water. Those included parts of Campus Drive and the intersection of Duke University Road and Anderson Street.</p>

<p>In a series of tweets Friday night, the Duke Marine Lab wrote that Beaufort Mayor Rett Newton and emergency personnel made it on Pivers Island to scope out the damage caused by the hurricane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Aside from a tree down, missing shingles and a derelict boat under dock, the worst damage was to Repass Teaching lab, which has the roof peeled back," the <a href="https://twitter.com/DukeMarineLab" target="_blank">tweet stated</a>.</p>
<p>Beaufort remains under a 24 hour curfew, according to the lab's tweets, and the lab will remain closed until further notice.</p>
<p>"For those who evacuated, please stay away until we’ve determined it is safe to return," Newton said. "Please be patient as we transition to the recovery phase of this storm.”</p>

<h3>Florence now categorized as tropical storm (Friday, Sept. 14 at 4:40 p.m.)</h3>
<p>The National Hurricane Center <a href="https://twitter.com/NHC_Atlantic/status/1040701730877595649" target="_blank">downgraded</a> Florence from a hurricane to a tropical storm Friday. The shift came because its winds <a href="https://www.cbs17.com/weather/hurricane-center/florence-demoted-to-tropical-storm-status/1444958156" target="_blank">dropped</a> below 70 mph.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Florence kills three in North Carolina (Friday, Sept. 14 at 3:20 p.m.)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Three people have died due to Hurricane Florence, according to a press release. One was killed while plugging in a generator and two more were killed when a tree fell on a home. Gov. Roy Cooper urged people to seek shelter and heed warnings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Our hearts go out to the families of those who died in this storm," Cooper said in the release. "Hurricane Florence is going to continue its violent grind across our state for days. Be extremely careful and stay alert."</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Duke still at risk of flooding, isolated tornadoes (Friday, Sept. 14 at 1:00 p.m.)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>There is still risk of flooding on Duke's campus from Florence, with six to 10 inches of rainfall expected in the next few days, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/WorkingatDuke/status/1040650668506263552" target="_blank">Working@Duke</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>DSG elections for first-year senators postponed (Thursday, Sept. 13 at 12:53 p.m.)</h3>
<p>In the weekly newsletter email to the student body Thursday morning, senior Kristina Smith, president of Duke Student Government, wrote that the elections for first-year senate elections are being pushed back. The elections will now be held from 12 p.m. Sept. 20 to 12 p.m. Sept. 21.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For at-large applicants, the interviews will be completed next week, Smith wrote.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Florence downgraded to Category 2 (Wednesday, Sept. 12 at 11:30 p.m.)</h3>
<p>The storm, which at its strongest was a Category 4 hurricane, was downgraded to a Category 2 before it struck the N.C. coast.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Tentative bus schedules announced (Wednesday, Sept. 12 at 10:30 p.m.)</h3>
<p>Duke's buses will continue to run on a modified schedule for the next several days but van service will be closed Friday, Saturday and Sunday, according to an update posted on the TransLoc app.</p>
<p>For Thursday, the LaSalle Loop Tripper and C3 Class Change will not be running, and C1 and CCX service will stop at midnight. Weather permitting, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, one CCX and one C1 bus will be in operation from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. An additional C1 will be running from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., according to the app.</p>
<p>The Swift Express will also be running from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>Swift residents receive advisory about elevators, parking garage (Wednesday, Sept. 12 at 8:15 p.m.)</h3>
<p>The 300 Swift parking garage will be opened at 10 a.m. Thursday as a location for Swift students to store their vehicles during the storm—even if they don't have a parking pass. All cars must be removed by noon on Tuesday, wrote Aneshia Jerralds, assistant dean for Central Campus, in an email.</p>
<p>Swift residents were also told that only one elevator in the complex would be active during the storm. There is a warning posted about elevator usage in the event of a possible power outage.</p>
<p>"It is important to note that due to the uncertainty in the power grid during a hurricane it is advised that residents utilize the stairs whenever possible," read a note near a 300 Swift elevator. "If you become trapped in the elevator due to a loss of power, use the button with the phone icon on it to alert authorities."</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Florence downgraded to Category 3 Hurricane (Wednesday, Sept 12 at 8:00 p.m.)</h3>
<p>The storm, now <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2018/09/12/hurricane-florence-charges-toward-carolinas-with-potential-for-unbelievable-damage/?utm_term=.452e19f40311" target="_self">Category 3</a>, will hit the Carolinas Friday with catastrophic winds and rain. Florence is expected to slow significantly upon hitting the coast but the rain and winds are not to be taken lightly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peak winds decreased from 130 mph, but the storm grew in size, “which will create a significant storm surge event,” according to the National Hurricane Center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The storm's surge is expected to reach over 10 feet at peak. Winds will be strong enough to knock down trees and damage buildings.</p>
<h3>Students receive email about parking in Science Drive garage (Wednesday, Sept. 12 at 3:00 p.m.)</h3>
<p>Some students will not have to leave their cars parked in the elements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andrew Hinz, senior operations manager for Duke Parking and Transportation Services, sent out an email Thursday afternoon permitting some students to park their cars in the Science Drive parking garage starting Thursday at 5 p.m. until Sunday at 9 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"If you do not wish to park in the Science Drive garage during this weather event, your vehicle may remain in its assigned lot," Hinz wrote.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h3>Storm shifts significantly southwest (Wednesday, Sept. 12 at 5:00 a.m.)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The National Weather Service has reported that Florence has significantly shifted southwest from where it was previously expected to travel. This projected shift would leave Durham more out of harm's way than before.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="embed"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">9/12 5AM Update: Significant SW shift in the track of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Florence?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Florence</a>.

<h3>Most of Duke has underground power lines, but not 300 Swift (Tuesday, Sept. 11 at 9:45 p.m.)&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In an email to residents, Aneshia Jerralds, assistant dean for central campus, said that power lines to 300 Swift, 301 Swift and Smart Home are above ground, leaving them more susceptible to debris and rain. The city of Durham has the ability to restore power in these buildings, but not Duke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
