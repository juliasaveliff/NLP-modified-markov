# NLP-modified-markov

ECE590 - NLP Final project

`chronicle.py` was the script used to process the scraped raw html data (in `/html`) and output the processed data to `data.json`.

`mtg-modified-bigram.py` contains our modified markov model. Within this file, we have the `finish_sentence_simple()` method, which is an implementation of the basic, n-gram Markov model, as well as `finish_sentence()`, which is the final working model that we implemented.
