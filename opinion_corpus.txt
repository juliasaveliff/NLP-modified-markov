In
my
previous
column
,
I
highlighted
some
areas
of
improvement
in
the
curriculum
,
including
the
BME
Design
Fellows
,
a
great
step
in
developing
skills
which
could
be
used
in
the
engineering
industry
,
an
area
which
was
previously
lacking
.
Greg
Goldman
,
a
BME
ECE
senior
appreciated
the
support
and
focus
on
industry
related
engineering
in
the
BME
Design
Fellows
.
The
instruction
was
excellent
,
he
said
.
A
big
improvement
would
simply
come
from
more
rigor
.
I
would
love
to
see
a
required
project
in
that
class
which
involves
using
the
machine
shop
.
Goldman
brings
up
an
interesting
subject
projects
.
While
many
BME
classes
have
labs
,
not
many
of
those
labs
actually
have
projects
,
especially
ones
that
provide
emphasis
on
creating
something
.
While
this
may
be
the
effect
of
a
curriculum
in
which
students
walk
away
with
a
little
bit
of
everything
,
students
should
be
given
the
option
to
specialize
early
if
they’d
chose
to
,
and
develop
the
skills
they
need
to
succeed
for
whichever
field
they’re
interested
in
.
For
those
interested
in
engineering
industry
,
they
should
be
provided
the
instruction
and
resources
to
develop
skills
useful
for
industry
in
a
classroom
setting
through
projects
.
For
me
,
medical
devices
were
what
I
was
interested
in
,
and
what
I
wanted
to
do
coming
to
Duke
.
My
favorite
class
at
Duke
was
my
class
on
medical
devices
and
instrumentation
.
Each
week
,
I
learned
about
a
new
technology
and
medical
device
,
and
implemented
some
version
of
it
in
lab
,
culminating
in
a
project
that
used
knowledge
garnered
throughout
the
semester
.
I
learned
a
great
deal
in
the
class
,
and
was
eager
to
learn
more
about
circuits
,
electronic
design
,
and
its
biomedical
application
.
But
the
next
chance
was
my
senior
design
class
.
It
feels
that
at
the
end
of
my
college
career
,
only
three
classes
in
BME
were
actually
helpful
for
my
interests
.
I
wish
I
could
have
taken
two
or
three
design
classes
in
place
of
some
of
the
other
BME
classes
I
was
forced
to
take
.
A
way
to
improve
would
be
to
let
students
design
their
own
BME
major
,
and
pick
and
choose
the
classes
that
they’re
interested
in
,
supplemented
with
classes
from
other
majors
.
It
can
still
maintain
the
focus
on
interdisciplinary
studies
,
but
would
be
more
specialized
.
Hypothetical
,
specializing
tracks
in
BME
could
be
for
those
interested
in
going
to
graduate
medical
school
,
those
interested
in
industry
,
and
those
interested
in
other
fields
but
still
want
to
develop
a
strong
quantitative
and
analytical
background
.
As
nice
as
it
is
to
learn
how
the
heart
works
,
or
how
to
model
enzyme
kinetics
,
that
could
be
part
of
the
pre
med
track
within
Duke
BME
,
and
a
student
interested
in
signal
processing
,
or
medical
devices
could
opt
out
of
those
classes
if
they
felt
that
they
wouldn’t
benefit
from
those
classes
,
creating
a
pick
and
choose
model
for
better
specialization
.
One
could
argue
that
this
becomes
a
nightmare
for
those
who
aren’t
sure
what
they
want
to
do
there
becomes
too
many
options
available
for
the
indecisive
ones
,
and
that
the
current
curriculum’s
model
of
delving
into
the
widest
range
of
topics
helps
one
determine
their
interests
,
rather
than
embarking
on
a
wild
goose
chase
to
find
an
area
they
like
.
A
redesigned
curriculum
focused
on
electives
could
mitigate
this
issue
.
Give
us
a
better
introductory
course
,
or
perhaps
even
a
two
semester
introductory
course
,
covering
different
topics
to
give
an
overview
of
the
broad
field
of
BME
.
This
intro
course
,
with
enough
academic
rigor
to
prepare
students
for
difficult
electives
,
could
prove
to
be
vastly
rewarding
.
Alternatively
,
core
introductory
classes
,
similar
to
how
ECE
does
it
with
their
200
level
classes
,
could
be
used
to
bring
the
area
cores
in
BME
imaging
,
biomechanics
,
and
electrobiology
to
students
earlier
rather
than
waiting
until
second
semester
junior
year
,
allowing
more
freedom
for
upper
level
electives
taught
by
Duke’s
great
BME
faculty
who
spearhead
world
class
research
,
or
classes
from
other
engineering
majors
.
Duke
BME
does
a
decent
job
right
now
in
preparing
students
for
graduate
school
through
academics
and
research
,
for
medical
school
because
the
curriculum
overlaps
a
lot
with
the
pre
med
track
,
and
for
business
consulting
through
analytical
skills
.
The
Duke
BME
education
is
less
useful
for
students
interested
in
engineering
industry
,
because
students
who
are
not
double
majors
often
have
difficulty
working
in
areas
that
they’re
interested
in
,
especially
the
medical
devices
industry
.
It’s
not
until
junior
year
that
students
realize
they
have
difficulty
competing
against
an
ECE
or
a
mechanical
engineering
major
for
industry
jobs
because
they
simply
don’t
know
enough
in
comparison
.
It’s
also
difficult
for
BME
majors
to
find
what
they’re
looking
for
in
career
prospects
.
Joanne
Zheng
,
a
BME
ECE
junior
said
,
I
wish
Duke
supported
my
career
path
.
I’m
a
junior
right
now
,
and
I’ve
been
desperately
looking
for
an
internship
.
Going
to
TechConnect
and
the
Career
Fair
I’ve
been
given
the
opportunity
to
talk
to
maybe
three
medical
device
companies
and
two
hardware
companies
.
As
someone
who
aspires
to
work
with
medical
devices
in
the
future
,
this
pales
in
comparison
to
the
number
of
finance
companies
,
banks
,
software
engineering
opportunities
,
that
my
computer
science
or
finance
friends
are
afforded
.
I
can
spend
hours
scouring
Career
Connections
,
but
there
are
minimal
listings
that
resemble
anything
I
want
to
do
.
nbsp
;
TechConnect
,
while
often
advertised
to
engineering
majors
,
really
becomes
a
software
engineering
career
fair
,
so
a
BME
career
fair
similar
to
Georgia
Tech’s
could
be
vastly
beneficial
.
Duke’s
strong
BME
program
is
almost
there
,
and
my
tone
in
these
two
columns
may
seem
a
little
more
critical
than
how
I
actually
feel
about
my
BME
education
.
I
understand
that
change
is
difficult
to
implement
,
and
that
I
am
by
no
means
familiar
with
being
an
educator
.
I
wrote
these
two
columns
not
to
criticize
,
but
to
offer
an
honest
opinion
of
how
I
think
the
program
can
improve
.
Let’s
cut
the
crap
I
don’t
know
a
thing
about
trains
and
you
probably
don’t
either
,
but
I’ll
be
damned
if
the
prospect
of
a
luscious
locomotive
cruising
through
Durham’s
downtown
doesn’t
get
me
hot
under
the
collar
.
Here
are
five
reasons
why
the
proposed
light
rail
system
is
an
absolute
no

What

you
?
A

Yeah
,
me
neither
,
so
let’s
stop
shovelling
horse
sh
t
into
the
Chronicle
under
the
guise
of
train
based
opinion
pieces
and
get
down
to
brass
tacks
.
Take
a
look
at
the
best
films
of
all
time
The
Polar
Express
,
Rocky
V
Man

,
Tristan
Bouan’s
critically
acclaimed
,
over

,
under

never
completed
Trainhopper
.
What
do
they
all
have
in
common
?
Trains
.
Now
look
at
the
the
worst
movies
of
all
time
Titanic
,
Avatar
,
Citizen
Kane
,
Jaws
,
Forrest
Gump
.
Notice
anything
?
Heavy
emphasis
on
boats
and
running
.
Let’s
cut
to
the
chase
trains
equal
good
movies
.
Movies
mean
more
money
going
around

and
in
his
2017
commencement
address

it
crystal
clear

The
proposed
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
would
have
stops
near
Duke
University
Medical
Center
and
on
Ninth
Street
.
To
the
Editor
I
have
read
with
increased
incredulity
the
spate
of
letters
to
the
Chronicle
about
Duke’s
supposed
last
minute
refusal
to
support
an
environmentally
nonsensical
light
rail
stop
at
Duke
Hospital
North
.
When
this
subject
first
came
up
you
published
the
following
letter
from
me
04
26
1999
Duke’s
recent
statements
of
its
position
are
not
new
.
The
financial
involvement
of
too
many
Durham
city
and
county
officials
with
the
over
100
million
spent
so
far
on
this
boondoggle
has
,
of
course
,
never
led
the
local
newspapers
or
TV
stations
to
ask
cui
bono
?
Perhaps
the
Chronicle
investigative
reporters
can
ask
these
questions
?
In
economics
,
we
say
sunk
costs
are
sunk
.
In
poker
,
it’s
said
don’t
throw
good
money
after
bad
.
The
environmental
costs
of
this
debacle
are
immense
,
and
have
never
been
properly
accounted
.
I
am
delighted
that
the
current
Duke
administration
takes
their
fiduciary
responsibility
as
seriously
as
they
do
.
Light
rail
is
a
project
that
Raleigh
,
Wake
County
and
the
Research
Triangle
Park
rejected
as
the
wrong
solution
to
the
wrong
set
of
questions
.
It
is
a
project
twenty
years
ahead
of
its
time
,
but
its
time
was
1980
.
Electric
vehicles
,
self
driving
vehicles
,
and
so
on
are
coming

Fixed

Last
week
,
the
Duke
Student
Government
DSG
Senate
voted
to
ban
laptop
use
during
their
weekly
Wednesday
night
sessions
.
The
new
policy
,
unsurprisingly
,
was
met
with
mixed
responses
,
notably
from
Senators
Jimmy
Xiao
and
Kyle
Melatti
,
who
cited
accessibility
issues
,
in
speaking
out
against
the
ban
.
Meanwhile
,
President
Kristina
Smith
,
and
President
pro
tempore
Avery
Boltwood
spoke
in
favor
of
the
new
policy
,
claiming
that
it
would
improve
engagement
during
long
,
multi
hour
DSG
sessions
.
Although
not
as
scandalous
in
comparison
to
some
past
DSG
controversies
,
this
new
policy
provides
an
opportune
time
to
reflect
upon
our
student
government’s
many
shortcomings
and
positives
.
In
2017
,
the
Chronicle
reported
on
a
history
of
chronic
tardiness
and
absenteeism
among
senators
in
DSG
,
a
situation
that
has
noticeably
improved
in
recent
years
.
This
followed
another
report
in
the
same
year
examining
the
lack
of
socioeconomic
diversity
within
the
organization
.
These
facts
,
along
with
persistent
concerns
over
representation
and
efficiency
,
generally
led
to
a
reorganization
of
the
Senate’s
structure
.
And
yet
,
it
seems
that
some
of
the
tropes
of
DSG
as
ineffective
and
woefully
disorganized
have
persisted
,
at
least
in
this
latest
meeting
.
Notably
,
after
passing
the
amendment
banning
laptop
use
,
Gerald
Harris
,
the
organization’s
advisor
and
director
of
student
involvement
,
chastised
the
body
for
its
lack
of
professionalism
and
attention
to
the
business
at
hand
,
claiming
that
Y’all
gotta
pay
more
attention
in
Senate
,
period
.
In
many
ways
,
critiques
of
DSG
have
become
tiring
,
begging
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
need
to
take
their
proceedings
,
and
therefore
shortcomings
,
too
seriously
here
at
Duke
.
Rarely
are
we
in
class
without
a
laptop
out
and
even
rarer
still
is
a
laptop
open
without
at
least
two
tabs
unrelated
to
the
business
at
hand
;
so
much
so
that
many
professors
have
adopted
no
laptop
policies
to
improve
in
class
engagement
.
Given
the
implementation
of
an
official
,
enforceable
laptop
ban
during
DSG
sessions
,
one
can
only
wonder
the
extent
to
which
many
DSG
senators
have
become
distracted
by
the
sweet
digital
relief
provided
by
Facebook
,
ESPN
,
and
Forever21
,
hidden
behind
their
furtive
MacBook
screens
.
Surely
,
as
elected
officials
chosen
to
represent
the
student
body
,
their
attention
can
better
be
placed
on
more
pressing
matters
we
have
entrusted
them
with
,
such
as
SOFC
funding
or
solving
the
rampant
sexual
assault
problem
on
campus
.
Once
and
a
while
it
is
helpful
to
look
outside
ourselves
and
consider
DSG’s
potential
rather
than
its
existence
.
There
are
numerous
other
examples
of
student
governments
,
many
of
which
have
also
struggled
with
similar
questions
of
respectability
.
In
examining
how
other
schools’
student
governments
responded
to
such
problems
,
we
may
find
models
for
ways
that
DSG
might
live
up
to
the
expectations
of
truly
being
the
representative
student
body
for
Duke’s
6
,
500
odd
undergraduates
.
Each
administration
at
Davidson
College
,
for
example
,
publishes
a
strategic
plan
to
ensure
that
there
is
a
clear
,
transparent
vision
for
the
year
beyond
vague
,
overly
ambitious
campaign
platforms
.
Even
small
gestures
of
professionalism
can
make
all
the
difference
.
The
executive
branch
of
UNC’s
Undergraduate
Student
Government
regularly
updates
their
website
with
information
on
all
ongoing
work
not
just
projects
to
keep
obvious
and
accessible
records
in
service
of
the
student
body
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
DSG
,
especially
within
the
Senate
,
has
not
made
commendable
progress
in
the
past
few
years
.
Beginning
with
the
restructuring
mentioned
earlier
,
more
and
more
attention
has
been
paid
to
organizational
,
institutional
reforms
.
The
introduction
of
a
caucus
system
last
year
as
a
way
of
encouraging
senators
to
break
out
of
the
rigid
committee
project
structure
was
one
such
reform
although
the
full
impact
is
yet
unclear
.
DSGHub
,
also
introduced
last
year
,
provides
a
more
transparent
way
for
members
of
the
public
or
intrepid
reporters
to
access
Senate
agendas
and
recent
legislation
.
Similarly
,
projects
like
the
5
Daily
Devil
Deals
or
the
recent
change
to
the
first
year
meal
plan
that
directly
affect
students’
well
being
and
are
serious
and
commendable
uses
of
DSG’s
organizational
authority
.
DSG
does
not
have
to
do
anything
,
nor
does
it
have
to
be
taken
seriously
by
us
.
But
it
is
endowed
with
a
significant
degree
of
institutional
legitimacy
that
few
of
us
could
achieve
on
our
own
as
individual
students
.
And
,
it
is
certainly
unfortunate
that
this
weight
along
with
the
work
of
those
within
DSG
pushing
our
campus
in
a
better
direction
is
yet
again
overshadowed
by
a
petty
and
resolvable
controversy
.
Yet
,
with
this
new
laptop
ban
in
place
,
DSG
as
an
institutional
body
hopefully
can
concentrate
more
on
pressing
issues
at
hand
instead
of
scrolling
through
the
memes
page
in
the
middle
of
SOFC
budgeting
.
Duke's
Board
of
Trustees
meetings
are
typically
held
at
the
Washington
Duke
Inn
.
Do
you
ever
wonder
if
members
of
the
Board
of
Trustees
read
the
Chronicle
?
The
Chronicle
is
the
one
place
on
campus
,
save
maybe
K
Ville
,
where
all
aspects
of
Duke
unite
and
reflect
the
most
honest
versions
of
themselves
.
The
front
pages
are
plastered
with
the
latest
scandal
,
the
sports
section
is
flooded
with
love
letters
to
everyone’s
favorite
valentine
,
Zion
Williamson
,
and
the
opinion
section
is
filled
with
columns
that
reflect
the
honest
views
of
students
.
Columns
that
,
largely
,
question
whether
or
not
the
people
in
charge
of
our
education
are
connected
to
the
students
most
impacted
by
their
decisions
.
Based
on
the
latest
update
to
come
from
the
Board
of
Directors
,
I
would
argue
they
aren’t
as
connected
to
the
concerns
of
the
most
marginalized
as
we
might
assume
.
As
The
Chronicle
reported
,
tuition
is
set
to
increase
by
3
.
9
percent
over
the
next
few
years
.
While
49
percent
of
Duke
students
are
able
to
afford
tuition
without
any
aid
,
I
believe
Duke
is
failing
students
who
need
financial
aid
to
make
Duke
work
for
them
.
Understandably
,
the
University
needs
money
to
function
properly
.
Duke
is
a
unique
place
that
provides
so
many
students
with
an
educational
journey
of
a
lifetime
.
From
programs
like
DukeEngage
and
DukeImmerse
,
to
assistive
services
like
the
Career
Center
and
the
Academic
Advising
Center
,
right
down
to
,
arguable
,
the
best
dining
in
the
nation
,
Duke
has
a
lot
to
offer
its
students
.
Getting
into
Duke
and
becoming
a
student
filled
so
many
of
us
with
pride
because
we
understood
that
what
is
available
here
is
unmatched
by
any
other
university
.
My
worry
is
that
,
as
time
passes
and
tuition
increases
,
fewer
students
would
see
Duke
as
the
door
opening
,
world
view
expanding
place
that
we
all
know
and
love
.
I
am
worried
that
instead
,
Duke
will
become
a
university
whose
gates
are
closed
to
students
who
cannot
pay
high
tuition
but
would
otherwise
benefit
from
everything
this
school
has
to
offer
.
One
of
the
most
defining
moments
of
my
time
here
at
Duke
came
almost
a
year
ago
.
I
was
talking
to
a
p
frosh
about
all
he’d
come
to
love
about
Duke
during
Blue
Devil
Days
.
One
of
the
last
things
he
told
me
,
however
,
was
that
he
wouldn’t
be
able
to
come
to
the
schools
that
he
grew
to
love
because
it
was
too
expensive
and
Duke’s
loan
based
financial
aid
package
wouldn’t
work
for
his
family
.
I
pointed
him
in
every
direction
I
knew
to
try
to
scrape
a
few
extra
dollars
out
of
Daddy
Duke
,
but
to
no
avail
.
He
didn’t
end
up
coming
to
Duke
.
My
conversations
with
this
p
frosh
reflect
the
sticker
shock
that
accompanies
a
Duke
acceptance
letter
.
For
many
,
this
initial
price
shuts
down
the
possibility
of
Duke
from
the
get
go
.
Students
who
manage
to
stretch
their
dollars
and
enroll
without
the
assurance
that
comes
with
growing
up
in
financial
security
face
an
altogether
different
set
of
challenges
.
Changing
eating
habits
,
taking
on
multiple
jobs
while
balancing
a
rigorous
course
load
,
and
opting
out
of
Duke’s
highly
visible
social
scene
are
basic
examples
of
all
the
ways
students
on
this
campus
try
to
balance
lower
socioeconomic
status
at
a
school
that
never
stops
building
markers
of
wealth
.
The
conversation
around
financial
accessibility
has
played
out
in
the
pages
of
the
Chronicle
this
semester
.
Starting
off
as
commentary
on
how
certain
students
find
social
life
at
Duke
to
be
inaccessible
and
ending
up
as
a
plea
for
Duke
to
do
more
to
support
students
who
fall
outside
of
Duke’s
economically
well
situated
class
,
the
conversation
about
accessibility
has
taken
center
stage
this
semester
.
Senior
Tyler
Goldberger
put
it
best
when
he
wrote
,
the
juxtaposition
between
Duke’s
commitment
to
parading
its
expansive
wealth
in
front
of
the
world
and
my
financial
background
leads
to
feelings
of
isolation
and
solitude
.
It’s
important
to
note
that
low
SES
students
are
not
lazy
or
passive
on
this
campus
.
In
many
situations
,
students
are
taking
it
upon
themselves
to
make
Duke
more
accessible
.
DSG
has
been
extremely
effective
at
increasing
transparency
for
course
costs
as
to
not
blindside
students
while
also
increasing
the
number
of
food
points
given
to
first
years
so
that
students
are
able
to
afford
three
meals
a
day
.
This
speaks
to
the
care
and
attention
Duke
students
pay
to
the
opportunities
given
to
their
peers
.
Campus
leaders
identify
issues
and
work
tirelessly
to
solve
them
.
However
,
the
burden
to
make
Duke
more
affordable
across
income
levels
cannot
only
be
placed
on
students
.
After
all
,
if
we
are
asking
low
income
students
to
buy
into
an
education
one
that
still
relies
on
loans
,
while
peer
institutions
do
not
more
than
1
.
6
percent
of
them
should
see
an
increase
in
wealth
as
a
result
of
their
Duke
degree
.
As
senior
Ethan
Ahuna
asks
,
Why
do
we
pay
so
much
money
to
take
those
classes
here
?
As
Ethan
mentions
in
his
own
column
,
learning
at
Duke
is
a
unique
opportunity
.
We
have
access
to
some
of
the
best
professors
,
utilities
and
peers
the
country
has
to
offer
.
Outside
of
the
classroom
,
Duke’s
extracurricular
and
entertainment
activities
are
par
none

At
the
beginning
of
this
year’s
fall
semester
,
I
urged
Duke
to
do
a
better
job
of
addressing
hate
speech
on
this
campus
.
Thankfully
,
between
now
and
then
,
the
University
has
put
forth
logical
and
tangible
initiatives
to
make
Duke
safer
and
more
welcoming
to
students
with
marginalized
identities
.
I
want
to
urge
Duke
,
now
,
to
do
a
better
job
of
addressing
the
reality
for
so
many
students
and
so
many
Americans
the
price
tag
of
a
Duke
education
is
too
high
for
those
would
stand
to
benefit
the
most
from
a
high
quality
education
.
I
cannot
imagine
what
lies
within
the
pages
of
Duke’s
financial
books
.
Nor
can
I
assume
that
if
I
were
a
member
of
the
Board
and
had
access
to
the
long
term
knowledge
that
they
do
that
I
would
have
voted
differently
.
I
understand
that
the
University
may
face
pressures
that
necessitate
a
tuition
increase
.
All
I
ask
is
that
the
Board
reevaluate
President
Price’s
commitment
to
financial
aid
.
That
the
University
has
invested
in
scholarship
programs
and
has
made
increases
in
other
categories
of
financial
aid
investment
shows
that
the
Board
understands
,
generally
,
the
economic
burden
that
most
students
face
.
However
,
we
must
go
beyond
that
.
The
Board
must
listen
to
students
who
have
a
hard
time
making
Duke
work
financially
.
As
students
,
we
must
continue
to
work
to
make
every
part
of
this
campus
as
accessible
as
possible
.
We
must
continue
to
push
for
change
that
makes
Duke
open
to
all
.
Duke
has
a
culture
of
philanthropy
and
that’s
awesome
.
You
can’t
walk
across
the
Bryan
Center
Plaza
without
being
flagged
by
numerous
student
groups
fundraising
for
various
charities
.
And
the
closer
I
get
to
graduating
,
the
more
subliminal
messages
I
get
from
Duke
trying
to
pressure
me
into
giving
back
to
the
university
.
ForeverDuke
!
Assuming
I’m
lucky
enough
to
have
money
to
give
back
,
how
do
I
decide
where
my
money
should
go
?
At
the
end
of
the
day
,
I
have
a
finite
amount
of
money
I
can
donate
,
so
there
are
obvious
tradeoffs
a
dollar
I
give
to
Charity
A
is
one
less
dollar
I
could
give
to
Charity
B
.
And
I’m
only
talking
about
this
in
context
of
donation
,
but
I
face
a
similar
problem
if
I
want
to
have
a
large
social
impact
with
my
career
.
In
case
you
thought
this
was
easy
,
I’ll
try
to
make
it
harder
for
you
ask
yourself
,
how
do
you
decide
between
working
at
or
donating
to
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
,
The
Jameel
Poverty
Action
Lab
,
Teach
for
America
,
Duke
or
the
Against
Malaria
Foundation
?
Most
people
recognize
the
need
to
make
sacrifices
for
the
long
term
,
hence
the
importance
of
solving
climate
change
how
do
we
weigh
the
considerations
of
people
now
vs
.
people
in
the
future
?
Is
overpopulation
something
we
should
be
worried
about
?
What’s
worse
living
in
extreme
poverty
or
having
malaria
?
Politicians
have
a
lot
of
influence
,
maybe
that’s
a
good
way
to
make
change
?
Unfortunately
,
discerning
where
we
can
have
maximal
impact
is
intractable
,
so
we
use
approximations
.
To
compare
problems
,
we
need
to
estimate
the
amount
of
good
done
per
extra
person
or
dollar
invested
in
each
problem
.
We
can
break
this
down
into
three
components
scale
amount
good
done
percent
problem
solved
,
tractability
percent
problem
solved
percent
increase
in
resources
,
and
neglectedness
percent
increase
in
resources
extra
person
or
dollar
.
The
nice
thing
about
this
framework
is
that
we
can
estimate
each
of
these
criteria
separately
,
then
multiply
them
to
get
back
amount
good
done
extra
person
or
dollar
.
This
framework
was
originally
developed
at
the
Open
Philanthropy
Project
,
then
expanded
upon
by
80
,
000
Hours
and
the
Future
of
Humanity
Institute
.
Why
do
we
want
to
put
numbers
on
things
as
opposed
to
just
use
intuition
to
make
decisions
?
I
can
feel
empathy
for
a
person
impacted
by
a
tragedy
,
but
my
brain
literally
cannot
even
begin
to
comprehend
the
suffering
of
almost
a
billion
people
living
in
extreme
poverty
.
This
idea
is
called
undervalued
risks
from
emerging
technologies
,
factory
farming
,
improving
institutional
decision
making
,
and
more
promising
areas
.
The
key
is
that
you
have
to
look
where
no
one
else
is
looking
.
As
a
result
,
some
results
may
be
counterintuitive
,
and
this
is
by
design
.
In
subsequent
columns
,
we’ll
explore
some
problems
that
seem
especially
urgent
,
and
how
you
can
you
use
your
donations
and
career
to
help
solve
them
.
Duke
exacted
revenge
on
Syracuse
despite
Zion
Williamson's
absence
.
Dear
Mr
.
Williamson
,
A
week
or
so
ago
,
Duke
fans
across
the
nation
sat
down
to
watch
our
team
,
and
you
in
particular
,
beat
the
Tar
out
of
the
Heels
.
Sadly
for
all
involved
,
you
went
down
with
an
injury
within
the
first
minute
of
the
game
when
your
shoe
literally
split
in
half
.
After
an
awful
night
,
one
filled
with
losses
and
disappointments
,
I
still
have
hope
that
this
whole
ordeal
could
end
on
a
positive
note
.
But
it
all
starts
with
one
,
big
step
please
never
play
basketball
in
a
Duke
jersey
again
.
I
don’t
ask
you
to
stop
playing
for
Duke
basketball
because
I
think
you
make
the
team
worse
,
that
would
be
ridiculous
you
are
one
of
the
best
college
basketball
players
in
recent
memory
.
I
don’t
ask
you
to
stop
playing
for
Duke
basketball
because
you
fail
to
be
entertaining
;
you’ve
produced
highlight
worthy
clips
since
you
were
in
high
school
and
your
incredible
dunks
have
continued
in
Cameron
.
I
am
asking
you
to
stop
playing
basketball
at
Duke
because
you
and
your
fellow
college
basketball
players
are
being
exploited
.
The
NCAA
National
College
Athletics
Association
is
an
unjust
racket
.
It
is
the
only
organization
in
the
country
that
pays
its
labor
force
college
basketball
players
nothing
,
pockets
all
of
the
profits
which
are
considerable
,
over
1
.
1
billion
in
2017
,
and
largely
escapes
public
outcry
despite
such
abnormal
,
predatory
practices
.
This
situation
persists
despite
the
fact
that
,
according
to
a
study
by
Drexel
University
,
if
college
basketball
players
received
a
percentage
of
league
revenue
equivalent
to
their
professional
counterparts
the
average
player
would
command
north
of
260
,
000
annually
.
Even
if
you
subtract
the
absurdly
expensive
annual
costs
of
attending
Duke
,
73
,
513
as
of
this
year
,
Duke
basketball
players
are
not
getting
paid
close
to
their
true
worth
.
Furthermore
,
the
typical
college
athlete
cannot
comfortably
shrug
this
injustice
off
.
In
fact
,
for
many
college
athletes
,
basketball
players
included
,
the
reality
is
quite
dire
over
86
percent
of
college
athletes
live
in
poverty
.
Adding
to
this
,
a
significant
number
of
college
athletes
come
from
poor
families
,
who
would
surely
benefit
from
an
extra
source
of
income
.
Yeah
but
most
of
these
players
go
on
to
the
NBA
!
In
a
few
years
they’ll
all
be
millionaires
,
right
?
Wrong
.
Yes
,
some
college
basketball
players
will
play
professionally
and
make
millions
from
their
salary
and
endorsements
.
But
most
will
not
.
Most
men’s
college
basketball
players
,
98
.
8
percent
according
to
the
NCAA
,
will
never
play
professionally
.
So
it’s
fairly
safe
to
say
that
for
the
Jordan
Goldwires
,
the
Mike
Buckmires
,
and
the
Alex
O’Connells
of
the
world
this
could
be
it
.
Their
few
years
at
Duke
will
likely
be
the
only
time
they
are
ever
economically
productive
as
basketball
players
.
And
yet
they
are
categorically
denied
the
right
to
make
any
money
whatsoever
during
the
limited
time
when
they
potentially
could
!
Jordan
Goldwire
cannot
sign
shoe
deals
.
Mike
Buckmire
cannot
charge
money
for
his
autographs
.
Alex
O’Connell
cannot
issue
endorsements
.
I
can
do
all
of
those
things
.
Why
do
I
have
rights
and
privileges
that
my
fellow
students
,
who
happen
to
be
basketball
players
,
do
not
?
If
that
does
not
sound
convenient
to
you
,
then
I
assure
you
it
sounds
convenient
to
the
NCAA
.
The
NCAA
defends
itself
by
arguing
that
these
players
are
amateurs
and
that
,
regardless
of
that
,
they
are
compensated
by
virtue
of
their
tuition
being
free
.
First
,
as
I
have
already
pointed
out
,
even
the
cost
of
a
Duke
education
is
still
an
underpayment
relative
to
their
true
value
.
Secondly
,
the
amateur
argument
is
absurd
on
its
face
.
In
what
sense
are
Division
I
basketball
players
amateurs
?
Maybe
college
basketball
players
are
amateurs
when
compared
to
LeBron
James
or
Kevin
Durant
.
But
when
compared
to
the
vast
majority
of
the
world’s
population
it
becomes
clear
that
college
basketball
players
are
not
amateurs
at
all
they
are
some
of
the
most
phenomenally
gifted
and
skilled
people
in
the
world
!
Given
that
that
is
true
,
these
athletes
should
be
compensated
as
such
.
Forget
about
March
,
the
real
madness
is
the
way
the
NCAA
treats
its
players
.
So
Zion
,
please
don’t
come
back
.
Instead
,
bring
attention
to
this
issue
and
use
your
platform
as
one
of
American
basketball’s
latest
and
greatest
stars
to
advocate
for
your
underprivileged
peers
.
As
we
all
know
,
you
get
compared
to
LeBron
on
a
daily
basis
.
Like
many
,
I
believe
you
can
be
the
next
LeBron
.
But
part
of
what
makes
LeBron
a
superstar
is
not
just
his
play
on
the
court
,
but
the
content
of
his
character
and
his
status
as
a
social
advocate
for
the
less
fortunate
.
Thousands
of
your
fellow
basketball
players
live
in
poverty
,
are
denied
the
same
rights
and
privileges
as
other
students
,
and
cannot
capitalize
on
the
one
chance
they
will
likely
ever
have
to
make
money
playing
basketball
.
In
ancient
Hebrew
,
Zion
roughly
means
promised
land
.
Hopefully
,
you
are
the
promised
man
who
will
help
right
the
wrongs
of
the
NCAA
.

Last
Wednesday
,
California
Governor
Gavin
Newsom
issued
an
executive
order
that
effectively
halted
capital
punishment
in
the
golden
state
.
In
a
state
with
737
individuals
in
death
row
more
than
six
in
10
of
whom
are
Black
or
Latinx
with
25
who
have
exhausted
their
appeals
,
the
deadline
to
sign
off
on
their
lethal
injections
would
have
been
at
the
start
of
April
of
this
year
.
Without
Governor
Newsoms’
moratorium
on
the
death
penalty
,
California
would
have
resumed
state
ordered
executions
after
a
13
year
hiatus
.
The
faults
that
Governor
Newsom’s
cited
in
his
decision
against
the
death
penalty
emanate
far
beyond
California’s
borders
.
Here
in
North
Carolina
,
more
than
1
,
000
individuals
have
been
sentenced
to
death
row
since
1910
.
In
North
Carolina
,
as
in
California
,
the
arbitrary
nature
by
which
the
death
penalty
is
applied
comes
at
the
detriment
of
people
of
color
.
The
chances
of
receiving
the
death
penalty
in
this
state
increases
3
.
5
times
if
the
defendant’s
victim
is
white
.
Race
is
far
from
the
only
way
to
characterize
capital
punishment
,
but
it
is
one
for
which
such
blatant
statistics
exist
.
The
chance
of
incriminating
the
wrong
individual
also
remains
uncomfortably
substantiated
.
Earlier
this
year
,
a
federal
appeals
court
ruled
that
Charles
Ray
Finch
,
who
was
sentenced
to
death
row
in
North
Carolina
42
years
ago
,
was
actually
innocent
of
his
murder
charge
.
With
the
undercurrents
of
racism
and
unreliability
that
explicitly
dominate
the
process
,
capital
punishment
creates
a
game
of
racial
Russian
roulette
out
of
the
criminal
justice
system
that
is
supposedly
meant
to
protect
our
citizens
.
Beyond
North
Carolina’s
capital
punishment
policies
,
racial
bias
is
the
signature
thread
that
winds
throughout
the
state’s
criminal
justice
system
.
In
the
state
,
black
students
are
almost
six
times
more
likely
to
be
arrested
in
school
than
their
white
peers
among
the
worst
in
the
United
States
.
This
,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
half
of
all
referrals
to
the
criminal
justice
system
come
from
schools
,
is
representative
of
a
state
that
falls
just
short
of
legally
codifying
the
school
to
prison
pipeline
for
children
of
color
.
Turning
a
blind
eye
to
the
disproportionate
placement
of
people
of
color
in
prisons
is
unjust
,
yet
remaining
ignorant
to
the
pathway
towards
execution
that
we
push
them
towards
is
inhumanly
cruel
.
The
inhumanity
of
state
sanctioned
killing
continues
,
however
,
to
enjoy
washed
down
portrayals
in
popular
entertainment
,
such
that
most
of
us
are
more
aware
of
who
is
sentenced
to
die
in
our
favorite
television
show
than
in
the
state
we
reside
in
.
Even
worse
,
is
the
continued
perpetuation
of
the
myth
that
life
long
imprisonment
is
a
waste
of
taxpayer
money
,
all
while
remaining
ignorant
to
the
fact
that
the
death
penalty
costs
higher
by
more
than
a
factor
of
18
in
California
.
Capital
punishment
is
a
barbaric
precipice
of
a
criminal
justice
system
already
marred
by
racism
and
classism
.
The
central
ethos
to
its
existence
punishment
for
the
killing
of
a
life
is
diluted
by
contradiction
If
a
person
kills
another
,
it
runs
contrary
to
the
rule
of
law
,
yet
when
the
state
does
it
,
it
i
chose
to
be
part
of
.
Our
status
as
Duke
students
extend
beyond
an
Instagram
bio
headline
.
As
students
of
Duke
,
we
are
students
of
Durham
,
students
of
North
Carolina
,
and
residents
of
state
that
possesses
the
authority
to
murder
its
citizens
.
As
such
,
it
is
imperative
that
we
progress
the
common
interests
of
the
community
that
has
provided
us
a
home
.
Or
,
perhaps
,
maybe
it
is
true
that
we
are
nothing
but
a
school
where
the
rich
send
their
entitled
children
to
trash
the
city
.
Every
March
,
right
before
the
start
of
spring
break
,
Duke
undergraduates
have
the
honor
of
ranking
their
choice
s
for
DSG
president
.
Facebook
becomes
inundated
with
campaign
photos
along
with
personal
and
group
endorsements
as
junior
DSG
candidates
seek
to
curry
enough
votes
to
claim
the
crown
of
DSG
president
on
March
8th
.
As
the
official
undergraduate
student
government
at
the
University
,
DSG
has
in
the
past
been
criticized
for
its
lack
of
diversity
,
poor
attendance
on
the
part
of
elected
student
representatives
and
for
perpetuating
a
cut
throat
,
resume
boosting
culture
among
its
members
.
Criticism
aside
,
the
role
of
DSG
president
holds
with
it
many
responsibilities
,
including
being
a
representative
of
student
voices
and
concerns
across
Duke’s
diverse
campus
community
.
This
year
,
as
always
,
three
very
talented
and
exceptional
student
leaders
compete
for
election
in
the
race
to
be
DSG
president
vice
president
of
academic
affairs
Saheel
Chodavadia
,
vice
president
of
services
and
sustainability
Liv
McKinney
and
vice
president
of
equity
and
outreach
Daisy
Almonte
.
The
independent
editorial
board
of
The
Chronicle
met
with
each
candidate
individually
to
discuss
their
platform
and
to
ask
various
questions
related
to
their
candidacy
.
All
three
presented
compelling
and
interesting
platforms
,
and
emphasized
their
previous
experiences
serving
as
the
leaders
of
their
respective
DSG
committees
.
In
the
end
,
after
careful
deliberation
,
the
board
has
decided
to
endorse
Daisy
Almonte
for
DSG
president
.
Like
Saheel’s
platform
,
Liv’s
platform
is
based
upon
three
ideas
to
make
Duke
accessible
,
to
hold
Duke
accountable
and
to
reimagine
student
life
.
Pointing
to
the
first
year
meal
plan
reform
she
led
,
Liv
emphasized
her
ability
to
keep
Duke’s
disconnected
administration
aware
of
student
concerns
,
including
the
shocking
revelation
of
food
scarcity
at
an
8
.
5
billion
institution
.
Moreover
,
Liv
also
highlighted
other
,
concrete
concerns
that
she
wished
to
tackle
as
DSG
president
,
such
as
connecting
first
years
to
institutionalized
financial
resources
on
campus
and
restructuring
Duke’s
sexual
assault
education
program
.
Finally
,
following
the
trinity
style
platforms
of
her
running
mates
,
Daisy
presented
a
set
of
campaign
objectives
based
in
equity
,
student
activism
and
securing
a
two
way
conversation
with
administrators
.
More
specific
agenda
items
within
Daisy’s
trifecta
of
presidential
goals
if
elected
include
forming
a
student
led
advisory
committee
for
financial
aid
,
and
reorienting
DSG’s
culture
more
toward
service
and
inclusion
,
instead
of
representing
a
social
space
for
well
connected
students
.
In
particular
,
Daisy
envisioned
her
role
,
if
elected
president
,
as
being
a
voice
for
marginalized
communities
at
Duke
voices
who
are
often
not
included
within
important
campus
spaces
.
Legitimate
critiques
can
be
made
that
the
role
of
DSG
president
should
be
based
more
upon
a
candidate’s
managerial
,
political
abilities
rather
than
an
activist
commitment
aimed
at
changing
the
status
quo
of
campus
life
.
However
,
campus
institutions
and
their
leadership
roles
are
never
fully
set
in
stone
,
and
can
be
flexible
depending
on
the
goals
of
whoever
wields
the
reins
of
power
.
The
role
of
being
an
activist
for
marginalized
groups
,
whether
it
be
undocumented
students
or
lower
income
students
,
is
a
bold
reimagining
of
the
DSG
presidential
position
.
Yet
,
at
a
university
that
still
struggles
immensely
with
diversity
and
inclusion
,
it
is
certainly
a
goal
that
has
the
power
to
question
the
status
quo
of
what
it
means
to
serve
as
a
student
leader
in
seemingly
staid
,
rigid
campus
institutions
,
including
DSG
and
The
Chronicle
.
This
Thursday
,
we
strongly
encourage
the
student
body
to
rank
Daisy
Almonte
first
when
choosing
the
next
DSG
president
.
As
outsiders
to
a
complicated
,
seemingly
closed
off
group
,
student
voters
are
somehow
expected
to
competently
choose
the
next
president
of
Duke
Student
Government
,
though
most
Duke
students
are
unlikely
to
be
able
to
name
every
executive
board
member
of
their
student
government
.
Again
,
putting
aside
this
anti
establishment
,
black
coffee
criticism
of
DSG
,
the
organization
does
accomplish
meaningful
work
for
the
student
body
,
and
the
president
of
DSG
is
able
to
be
a
true
voice
for
student
concerns
and
frustrations
on
a
divided
campus
.
Based
upon
our
interviews
with
the
candidates
,
Almonte
seems
to
be
the
leader
best
suited
to
take
up
the
mantle
of
DSG
president
for
the
2019
2020
year
.
Duke
is
partaking
in
a
national
crisis
,
and
it’s
only
getting
worse
.
It’s
contributing
to
the
enormous
cost
crisis
engulfing
the
higher
education
system
.
Last
week
,
the
Board
of
Trustees
approved
a
3
.
9
percent
increase
for
undergraduate
tuition
for
the
2019
2020
school
year
,
raising
the
total
tuition
to
55
,
880
.
The
total
cost
of
attendance
will
increase
by
3
.
7
percent
to
73
,
519
.
Although
this
increase
is
less
than
previous
years
percentage
wise
,
the
dollar
amount
is
still
staggering
.
Additionally
,
Duke’s
tuition
increases
have
significantly
outpaced
annual
inflation
,
which
was
1
.
9
percent
in
2018
.
No
wonder
the
median
family
income
of
a
Duke
student
is
186
,
700
.
Without
sufficient
loan
support
,
financial
aid
or
scholarship
compensation
,
Duke
students
must
have
the
ability
to
bear
a
massive
financial
burden
.
Plainly
speaking
Duke
is
really
,
really
expensive
.
Nineteen
percent
of
Duke
students
come
from
families
whose
income
ranks
in
the
top
one
percent
,
putting
Duke
third
in
this
category
compared
to
America’s
elite
universities
.
This
is
approximately
the
same
proportion
of
students
who
come
from
the
bottom
60
percent
of
income
.
Since
the
early
1980s
,
the
breakdown
of
socioeconomic
representation
at
Duke
has
remained
stable
.
A
2017
study
analyzed
by
the
New
York
Times
found
that
many
of
America’s
elite
institutions
are
becoming
more
economically
segregated
over
time
.
For
a
university
that
prides
itself
on
diversity
and
inclusion
,
Duke’s
tuition
increases
are
not
helping
its
cause
,
particularly
in
a
socioeconomic
sense
.
Unfortunately
,
it’s
not
the
sole
offender
among
private
nonprofits
.
Accounting
for
inflation
,
the
cost
of
an
undergraduate
degree
has
spiked
by
213
and
129
percent
since
the
late
1980s
at
public
and
private
schools
,
respectively
.
Why
is
college
so
expensive
?
It’s
complicated
.
The
Organization
for
Economic
Cooperation
and
Development
reports
that
the
U
.
S
.
spends
more
on
college
than
almost
any
other
country
nearly
30
,
000
per
student
.
Based
on
the
report
,
the
cost
of
attendance
per
student
at
Duke
is
about
four
times
the
amount
spent
per
student
in
the
average
developed
country
.
Because
college
students
in
the
U
.
S
.
are
more
likely
to
live
away
from
home
,
higher
expenditures
for
student
welfare
services
such
as
housing
,
meals
,
health
care
and
transportation
are
required
.
Duke’s
operating
budget
for
this
academic
year
was
2
.
7
billion
,
with
a
significant
portion
going
to
renovation
and
construction
projects
.
Over
the
past
few
years
,
Duke
has
become
notorious
for
fancy
amenities
and
accommodations
that
lead
to
increased
costs
.
Despite
the
luxuries
provided
by
American
universities
,
the
data
suggests
that
the
vast
majority
of
spending
is
incurred
from
educational
operations
such
as
salaries
for
staff
and
faculty
.
These
costs
total
23
,
000
per
student
,
which
is
more
than
double
the
amount
in
Finland
,
Sweden
and
Germany
.
A
lot
of
the
difference
comes
from
paying
non
teaching
staff
such
as
athletic
employees
,
lawyers
,
diversity
managers
,
admissions
and
financial
aid
officers
,
and
food
service
workers
.
Economically
speaking
,
college
is
a
service
rather
than
a
good
.
The
price
doesn’t
decrease
with
advances
in
technology
.
Furthermore
,
rankings
from
media
companies
such
as
U
.
S
.
News
amp
;
World
Report
have
likely
contributed
to
a
surge
in
demand
for
degrees
,
which
are
often
valued
based
on
the
reputation
of
the
institution
.
Duke’s
ranks
8th
on
this
list
and
often
attains
a
similar
rank
from
other
publications
.
The
Class
of
2022
had
37
,
302
applications
.
These
numbers
indicate
that
Duke
might
be
charging
so
much
in
part
because
it
can
get
away
with
it
.
The
changing
labor
force
is
also
putting
pressure
on
students
to
obtain
degrees
.
Over
3
million
people
in
the
U
.
S
.
are
expected
to
receive
a
degree
by
the
end
of
the
academic
year
.
This
number
is
expected
to
increase
as
Georgetown
University
finds
that
by
2020
,
65
percent
of
all
jobs
in
the
economy
will
require
postsecondary
education
and
training
beyond
high
school
.
Simply
put
,
economic
needs
are
making
college
degrees
more
popular
.
Fortunately
,
Duke
students
often
receive
a
large
return
on
investment
for
their
education
.
The
Wall
Street
Journal’s
annual
ranking
release
found
that
Duke
holds
the
top
spot
for
student
outcomes
,
which
is
,
based
in
part
on
how
much
of
a
difference
they
make
in
what
their
graduates
earn
10
years
after
enrollment
.
Some
would
argue
that
combined
with
the
financial
aid
compensation
,
a
Duke
degree
can
be
earned
at
a
major
discount
.
However
,
as
costs
continue
to
rise
,
middle
class
students
who
are
ineligible
for
aid
are
strapped
with
a
burden
that
could
shrink
their
representation
at
Duke
.

On
top
of
the
cost
of
tuition
itself
is
the
cost
of
financing
that
tuition
.
On
average
,
students
who
attended
American
universities
graduate
with
an
average
of
37
,
172
in
student
loan
debt
.
Collectively
,
this
adds
up
to
1
.
5
trillion
.
These
crushing
loans
apply
onerous
restrictions
on
graduates
when
it
comes
to
living
expenses
,
career
decisions
and
personal
finances
.
Duke
students
are
surely
not
immune
from
this
daunting
impediment
.
Although
Duke
is
committing
to
investing
more
in
financial
aid
,
tuition
increases
are
not
helping
expand
its
reach
.
Duke
should
strive
to
differentiate
itself
from
other
elite
institutions
by
making
attendance
more
affordable
.
We
used
to
say
that
you
couldn’t
put
a
price
on
education
.
However
,
with
the
university
cost
crisis
spiraling
out
of
control
,
many
of
us
will
be
forced
to
.
One
of
my
New
Year’s
resolutions
was
to
never
stay
up
late
for
an
assignment
.
It
was
a
pretty
unrealistic
goal
,
especially
for
me
.
In
high
school
,
I
wrote
essay
conclusions
on
the
bus
and
came
to
class
ten
minutes
late
because
I
still
had
to
print
the
essay
out
.
I
spent
my
weekends
telling
myself
I
would
start
my
work
right
after
the
Netflix
episode
ended
,
and
my
weeknights
staying
up
to
finish
assignments
that
I
meant
to
do
over
the
weekend
.
I
surprisingly
managed
to
stick
to
this
New
Year’s
resolution
for
the
first
few
weeks
of
the
semester
.
For
the
first
time
,
I
submitted
a
paper
more
than
ten
minutes
before
the
deadline
.
I
planned
my
days
out
hour
by
hour
and
did
my
readings
on
time
.
I
thought
I
was
doing
great
,
that
I
finally
had
it
together
,
until
one
afternoon
when
I
came
back
from
West
to
find
my
friends
sitting
outside
my
dorm
.
I
had
just
spent
an
entire
C1
ride
staring
at
my
planner
and
thinking
about
how
I
had
two
big
projects
due
that
week
and
not
enough
time
to
get
them
done
.
I
told
myself
I
would
just
talk
to
my
friends
for
a
couple
minutes
.
When
I
asked
them
how
they
were
,
one
of
my
friends
said
I’ve
done
most
of
my
work
,
so
I
basically
have
the
whole
afternoon
free
.
I
was
so
jealous
.
I
couldn’t
remember
the
last
time
I
spontaneously
had
a
free
moment
or
time
to
spare
.
I
realized
in
that
moment
how
exhausting
it
had
been
to
have
every
hour
of
my
day
straining
under
the
weight
of
all
the
work
I
should
be
doing
,
and
to
feel
as
though
I
didn’t
have
the
time
to
make
mistakes
.
It
was
so
defeating
to
know
that
I
had
been
careful
and
made
good
decisions
,
and
still
had
so
much
work
to
do
that
I
didn’t
have
the
time
to
just
sit
outside
and
talk
with
my
friends
.
I
had
done
my
best
,
and
it
still
wasn’t
good
enough
.
My
definition
of
good
enough
is
based
on
all
the
standards
I’ve
set
for
myself
.
I
have
to
do
well
in
my
statistics
class
because
I
might
want
to
economics
research
next
year
and
statistics
is
important
for
that
.
I
have
to
spend
another
hour
editing
this
opinion
column
because
I
know
it’s
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
.
I
have
to
take
this
house
course
because
the
course
would
qualify
me
for
a
club
position
that
I
want
.
I
have
to
volunteer
as
a
debate
coach
because
I
think
everyone
should
have
the
opportunity
to
do
debate
and
doing
this
work
might
help
me
get
the
job
that
I
want
this
summer
.
I
have
to
be
the
kind
of
person
who
has
all
these
goals
because
I
go
to
Duke
.
But
I
don’t
actually
have
to
do
anything
.
Goals
are
important
.
It’s
hard
to
be
motivated
without
a
deadline
or
something
concrete
to
aim
for
.
My
ability
to
set
high
standards
and
feel
as
though
it
is
necessary
that
I
meet
them
is
probably
one
of
the
reasons
I
got
into
Duke
.
But
goals
are
just
a
means
to
an
end
.
We
don’t
get
the
grade
or
research
position
or
job
for
their
own
sake
,
but
to
serve
the
scarily
abstract
things
we
want
for
our
lives
happiness
,
knowledge
,
helping
others
,
feeling
as
though
we’ve
made
the
most
out
of
the
opportunities
we
have
.
It’s
completely
illogical
to
feel
as
though
my
best
isn’t
good
enough
.
By
definition
,
my
best
is
all
I
can
do
.
If
the
thought
of
facing
another
week
of
work
at
Duke
immediately
makes
me
anxious
,
I’m
taking
on
too
much
.
I
used
to
think
that
if
I
could
get
something
decent
done
last
minute
,
I’d
be
practically
unstoppable
if
I
started
my
work
early
.
The
beauty
of
procrastination
is
that
you
never
have
to
confront
the
fact
that
you
might
not
be
as
talented
as
you
think
you
are
.
When
you
fail
,
you
can
blame
the
all
nighter
instead
of
a
lack
of
ability
.
But
I
realized
that
good
time
management
doesn’t
give
you
unlimited
time
,
it
just
means
you’re
more
intentional
with
your
time
.
Instead
of
frantically
deciding
what
standards
to
loosen
because
I
only
have
two
hours
to
do
three
assignments
,
I
have
to
acknowledge
that
I
don’t
have
the
time
or
capability
to
do
everything
I
want
to
and
coldly
eliminate
the
work
that
isn’t
a
priority
.
It’s
hard
,
but
it
means
that
I
can
actually
align
the
way
I
spend
my
time
with
what’s
important
to
me
.
I
can
plan
my
day
knowing
there’s
a
difference
between
being
ambitious
and
feeling
as
though
I’m
a
failure
if
I
don’t
meet
xyz
standards
.
In
a
conversation
between
author
Tim
Ferriss
and
University
of
Houston
professor
Brené
Brown
,
Ferriss
asked
How
do
you
balance
the
wellbeing
of
having
a
mindset
of
I
am
enough
,
’
versus
.
.
.
the
discontent
that
seems
to
drive
so
many
of
those
people
to
accomplish
great
things
?
Brown
replied
I
would
bet
you
a
lot
of
money
that
if
we
listed
the
names
of
ten
people
.
.
.
ten
competitive
,
ambitious
,
just
like
crazy
fighters
.
.
.
you
could
tell
me
the
five
who
are
motivated
from
a
place
of
being
enough
but
wanting
to
strive
for
excellence
and
learning
,
and
the
people
who
are
trying
to
fill
a
hole
in
their
self
worth
and
who
are
dangerous
.
When
I
came
up
against
my
own
limits
,
I
had
to
ask
myself
Which
of
these
people
do
I
want
to
be
?
I
hope
you
do
the
same
.
As
a
Duke
student
,
getting
flooded
with
emails
is
something
I’m
familiar
with
.
But
as
a
senior
this
year
,
a
new
type
of
email
has
made
its
way
into
my
inbox
emails
about
giving
to
Duke
.
We
are
asked
repeatedly
to
donate
money
,
with
incentives
including
Chapel
climbs
,
being
able
to
pick
where
our
money
goes
,
and
the
refrain
that
even
one
dollar
counts
.
But
money
is
not
the
only
way
to
give
to
Duke
,
and
it
should
not
be
treated
as
such
.
Last
semester
,
I
attended
a
Senior
Student
Leaders
Dinner
at
the
Washington
Duke
.
It
was
presented
as
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
notable
administrators
about
what
it
means
to
be
engaged
alumni
.
While
the
event
was
well
executed
,
I
quickly
realized
that
engagement
just
meant
donating
money
.
And
as
the
night
went
on
and
very
few
of
the
administrators
or
event
organizers
even
asked
me
what
leadership
positions
I
even
held
on
campus
,
it
became
clear
that
leadership
was
just
a
way
to
narrow
down
which
seniors
got
an
invite
to
dinner
.
I
am
the
first
to
admit
that
I
have
benefited
greatly
from
philanthropy
at
Duke
.
Coming
to
Duke
would
not
have
been
an
option
for
me
without
the
generous
financial
aid
package
I
received
.
Once
I
got
here
,
I
participated
in
DukeEngage
,
study
abroad
programs
and
paid
summer
research
activities
that
were
not
only
been
highlights
of
my
Duke
experience
but
impacted
my
worldview
.
Donations
are
indubitably
important
.
Without
them
,
students
like
me
could
not
partake
in
the
Duke
experience
,
and
the
Duke
experience
itself
would
not
be
the
same
.
And
I
also
know
that
5
percent
of
the
ranking
criteria
for
the
U
.
S
.
News
and
World
Report
college
rankings
is
alumni
engagement
,
the
percentage
of
the
graduating
class
that
donates
to
the
school
.
And
staying
high
up
in
those
rankings
keeps
our
stock
up
as
alumni
in
the
job
market
,
if
only
in
our
own
psyche
.
But
to
equate
engagement
with
giving
money
paints
an
incomplete
picture
.
For
one
,
it
feels
weird
and
wrong
that
Duke
is
already
asking
for
money
when
my
parents
just
finished
giving
up
a
large
chunk
of
their
life
savings
so
that
I
could
go
here
.
There
is
also
the
question
of
whether
I
fully
agree
with
what
Duke
stands
for
.
I
absolutely
want
to
support
future
students
and
help
them
have
the
most
fulfilling
and
accessible
college
experience
possible
,
but
do
I
want
to
make
a
monetary
contribution
to
an
institution
that
refuses
to
enact
a
hate
and
bias
policy
to
protect
marginalized
students
?
And
yes
,
no
one
is
asking
me
for
an
exorbitant
amount
of
money
.
But
to
create
great
events
for
the
senior
class
but
only
make
them
open
to
donors
makes
it
feel
like
we
are
being
bribed
you
can
come
to
a
ball
at
the
Nasher
or
climb
the
Chapel
,
but
only
if
you
pay
us
.
For
me
,
there
isn’t
a
clear
reason
why
being
solicited
for
money
before
I
even
graduate
feels
wrong
.
Duke
has
contributed
so
much
to
my
self
development
intellectually
,
interpersonally
and
ethically
.
But
the
notion
that
my
only
value
to
the
university
now
is
as
a
potential
financial
resource
feels
hollow
,
like
the
strides
I
made
here
as
a
person
are
not
as
important
as
the
financial
contribution
I
can
make
once
I
leave
.
One
of
the
invaluable
aspects
of
Duke
is
the
alumni
network
we
join
.
And
it’s
not
just
alumni
who
give
money
;
it’s
alumni
who
give
time
and
energy
.
Duke
alumni
are
very
willing
to
talk
to
you
about
their
jobs
,
give
you
advice
and
help
you
navigate
the
world
beyond
Duke
.
The
alumna
who
did
my
alumni
interview
when
I
was
a
senior
in
high
school
still
visits
campus
at
least
once
a
year
and
takes
me
out
to
dinner
every
time
.
These
connections
and
their
interpersonal
nature
are
priceless
,
and
they
exist
because
of
the
positive
experiences
and
fond
memories
these
people
have
with
their
alma
mater
.
There
is
a
sense
of
pride
that
many
feel
when
it
comes
to
being
a
Duke
graduate
,
and
that
camaraderie
is
not
something
money
can
buy
.
Again
,
I
understand
that
financial
donations
are
crucial
.
I’m
not
suggesting
that
giving
money
to
Duke
is
necessarily
harmful
.
If
you
can
give
,
and
you
want
to
,
you
should
.
But
being
guilt
tripped
into
giving
does
nothing
to
boost
engagement
.
And
to
not
consider
the
full
scope
of
alumni
engagement
is
to
omit
the
importance
of
the
alumni
network
and
the
human
capital
that
it
provides
for
current
and
former
members
of
the
Duke
community
.
If
Duke
has
impacted
you
the
way
it
has
impacted
me
,
then
you
should
give
to
Duke
.
You
can
give
by
donating
money
toward
scholarship
programs
that
have
impacted
you
.
Give
by
taking
the
time
as
an
alum
to
talk
with
undergraduates
who
are
interested
in
your
career
trajectory
.
Give
by
working
to
actively
make
the
world
outside
the
Duke
bubble
a
better
place
,
doing
so
with
the
skills
and
disposition
that
Duke
has
provided
you
.
But
give
because
you
care
about
Duke
students
,
because
you
want
the
institution
to
do
better
,
because
you
are
proud
of
your
alma
mater
.
A
1
donation
and
a
Chapel
climb
is
not
what
it
means
to
be
meaningfully
engaged
.
Every
day
on
my
walk
to
class
,
I
stroll
past
the
stunning
Duke
Chapel
that
towers
above
me
.
Sometimes
I
stop
to
stretch
my
head
up
and
take
in
the
glorious
architecture
.
I
see
this
iconic
structure
every
day
,
but
I
can’t
remember
the
last
time
I’ve
stepped
in
.
The
chapel
is
the
epicenter
of
this
school
,
yet
religion
is
the
most
distant
thing
I
experience
on
this
campus
.
The
stained
glass
windows
give
me
aesthetic
delight
and
a
warmth
of
nostalgia
,
but
the
reminder
of
religious
institutions
brings
back
dormant
memories
that
leave
a
sinking
feeling
in
my
stomach
.
A
week
ago
,
the
United
Methodist
Conference
voted
to
tighten
bans
on
same
sex
marriage
and
LGBT
ordinations
,
a
decision
that
caused
great
pain
for
LGBT
members
of
the
religious
community
and
prompted
sympathetic
responses
from
Duke
Divinity
School
officials
.
LGBT
members
of
congregations
felt
alienated
by
this
decision
and
are
faced
with
a
painful
situation
.
As
a
gay
man
from
a
Catholic
family
,
I
have
innate
empathy
for
the
people
affected
by
this
decision
,
especially
the
LGBT
students
in
the
Duke
Divinity
School
.
This
turmoil
reminded
me
of
my
own
internal
conflicts
with
religion
and
sexuality
,
as
well
as
my
tendency
to
avoid
such
issues
while
being
a
Duke
student
.
It
leaves
me
wondering
for
the
people
affected
by
this
decision
,
if
it
is
possible
to
reconcile
the
prejudice
of
an
institution
with
an
individual’s
own
desire
to
pursue
their
faith
.
I
went
to
church
every
single
Sunday
while
growing
up
.
I
had
complaints
with
the
Catholic
church
as
an
institution
,
but
I
believed
in
the
fundamental
truths
we
learned
.
I
thought
my
purpose
in
life
was
to
find
a
career
that
helped
other
people
,
marry
a
beautiful
wife
,
and
then
start
a
family
.
This
calling
felt
so
strong
and
immutable
that
I
ignored
the
writings
on
the
wall
whispering
to
me
that
I
wasn’t
straight
.
When
I
finally
accepted
that
I
was
gay
after
six
years
of
adamant
denial
and
self
hatred
,
my
cookie
cutter
future
dissipated
.
The
dream
I
had
been
grasping
on
fell
through
my
fingertips
and
scattered
like
ashes
in
the
wind
.
My
family
accepted
me
with
open
arms
,
but
the
church
blessed
me
with
a
cold
shoulder
.
I
was
told
by
my
religious
family
and
friends
that
being
gay
was
acceptable
in
the
eyes
of
God
,
even
if
the
church
historically
antagonized
homosexuals
.
Although
their
ideas
varied
,
I
generally
heard
the
generic
love
the
sinner
,
not
the
sin
argument
when
it
came
to
LGBT
people
.
In
the
Catholic
church
specifically
,
I
was
taught
that
all
sex
without
intention
to
procreate
is
a
sin
.
Thus
,
through
semantics
,
the
Catholic
church
was
able
to
not
outwardly
villainize
homosexuals
but
still
label
their
actions
as
sinful
.
Many
Christian
denominations
share
a
similar
doctrine
in
regards
to
LGBT
individuals
,
one
that
is
tolerant
of
their
identity
but
intolerant
of
them
acting
upon
their
identity
.
When
we
are
faced
with
a
community
or
institution
that
has
a
different
belief
,
we
have
multiple
options
.
We
can
speak
out
and
try
to
change
the
overall
beliefs
,
we
can
accept
their
rules
and
silently
suffer
,
or
we
can
distance
ourselves
from
the
community
.
For
me
,
the
Catholic
church
was
years
from
accepting
me
to
the
same
extent
that
I
have
learned
to
accept
myself
.
I
did
not
enjoy
the
thought
of
being
expected
to
stay
single
my
entire
life
,
and
I
found
the
patriarchal
system
to
be
irreparably
biased
against
women
.
Thus
,
I
did
not
see
the
Catholic
religion
as
being
compatible
with
me
being
gay
.
There
are
Catholic
youth
who
share
my
opinions
on
the
institution
but
are
committed
to
reforming
it
,
and
see
a
different
,
harmonious
future
.
Likewise
,
there
are
LGBT
ministers
and
future
ministers
who
are
paving
the
way
in
their
own
denominations
,
especially
here
at
Duke
Divinity
School
.
Roadblocks
such
as
the
recent
UMC
decision
question
if
reform
is
even
possible
in
immobile
institutions
.
How
does
one
continue
their
existence
in
a
community
that
denies
the
fullness
of
their
identity
?
I
was
never
as
attached
to
the
Catholic
church
as
I
was
to
my
feelings
of
spirituality
.
I
enjoy
reflection
,
acts
of
love
,
and
contemplation
of
life
and
our
place
in
this
universe
.
When
I
stepped
into
my
refreshed
life
as
a
gay
man
,
I
stopped
seeing
beauty
in
the
religion
that
I
knew
before
my
memory
.
The
condemnations
of
homosexuality
by
the
priest
at
the
altar
cut
deeper
,
and
my
aversion
to
my
previous
place
of
peace
arose
.
I
always
go
to
mass
with
my
family
,
since
I
love
them
more
than
myself
,
and
when
I
walk
through
the
doors
my
heart
beats
with
nervousness
as
I
feel
the
judgment
of
the
congregation
and
God
on
my
shoulders
.
It’s
the
same
feeling
I
get
when
I
stare
at
our
great
chapel
,
an
inescapable
feeling
of
shame
and
isolation
.
I
have
met
several
Divinity
School
students
in
my
time
here
,
and
these
lovely
individuals
give
me
hope
for
future
generations
of
LGBT
youth
who
grow
up
in
religious
communities
.
I’ve
had
deep
conversations
with
future
ministers
and
preachers
who
are
LGBT
identifying
or
outspoken
allies
,
types
of
people
I
never
expected
to
exist
.
They
have
the
bravery
to
embrace
their
full
identities
and
beliefs
in
the
face
of
institutions
that
try
to
shut
them
out
.
For
them
,
their
identity
and
religion
are
not
only
compatible
,
but
intertwined
.
I
can’t
help
but
to
imagine
what
would
have
been
different
if
I
had
a
LGBT
religious
leader
or
role
model
when
I
was
younger
.
Maybe
I
would’ve
been
inspired
to
reform
the
institutions
that
shaped
my
personal
life
.
Maybe
I
would’ve
come
out
earlier
.
Maybe
I
would
still
feel
welcome
stepping
into
my
home
church
.
Maybe
one
sunny
day
,
while
strolling
past
the
chapel
on
my
way
to
class
,
I
would
pause
to
look
up
at
the
magnificent
tower
,
and
I
would
smile
.
Maybe
I
would
go
in
.
In
a
recent
article
in
The
Chronicle
,
the
results
of
a
survey
given
to
Duke
undergraduates
in
2018
showed
that
almost
48
percent
of
women
respondents
at
Duke
were
sexually
assaulted
,
a
number
which
does
not
include
coerced
sexual
contact
and
sexual
harassment
.
nbsp
;
This
is
unacceptable
.
Imagine
if
almost
50
percent
of
students
contracted
an
illness
nbsp
;
which
affected
their
health
,
school
performance
,
and
may
impact
the
rest
of
their
lives
.
If
this
were
anything
but
sexual
assault
,
it
would
have
been
seen
and
addressed
as
a
public
health
and
campus
emergency
.
Unfortunately
,
these
numbers
come
as
no
surprise
to
me
,
nor
,
I
imagine
to
many
of
my
colleagues
in
the
area
.
nbsp
;
I
have
been
a
physician
for
Duke
students
,
both
undergraduate
and
graduate
,
as
well
as
Duke
faculty
and
staff
,
across
many
departments
and
disciplines
since
1985
.
nbsp
;
In
my
office
,
I
have
treated
many
nbsp
;
women
too
numerous
to
count
who
have
been
victims
of
every
sort
of
sexual
misconduct
.
nbsp
;
Women
who
were
sexually
assaulted
by
fellow
students
,
nbsp
;
their
lives
shattered
while
their
assailants
went
free
,
often
going
on
to
lucrative
careers
unmarred
by
the
experience
.
nbsp
;
Female
students
who
told
of
being
touched
inappropriately
by
their
advisers
,
taking
it
as
a
matter
of
course
,
undergraduates
raped
by
fellow
students
,
seduced
by
professors
.
Women
graduate
students
relay
that
their
nbsp
;
principal
investigators
have
nbsp
;
harassed
,
humiliated
and
or
propositioned
them
.
nbsp
;
I
have
seen
medical
students
whose
attending
physicians
or
research
advisers
had
an
expectation
of
sexual
favors
,
graduate
students
who
were
stalked
and
harassed
,
and
nbsp
;
resident
physicians
who
were
victims
of
sexual
misconduct
by
attending
physicians
.
This
is
but
a
brief
recounting
of
the
types
of
incidents
heard
over
the
years
,
all
of
them
occurring
at
Duke
.
nbsp
;
And
I
am
but
one
psychiatrist
seeing
a
minute
portion
of
the
Duke
community
,
most
of
them
privileged
enough
to
seek
and
afford
treatment
.
It
has
been
an
honor
to
work
with
these
women
,
to
be
entrusted
with
their
pain
and
the
difficult
journey
they
undertake
to
process
these
grievous
wounds
,
knowing
that
,
even
when
healing
occurs
,
the
scars
can
be
permanent
.
nbsp
;
As
a
psychiatrist
,
I
have
validated
and
supported
,
prescribed
medication
,
provided
psychotherapy
and
trauma
work
.
These
women
took
time
away
from
their
own
work
and
used
their
own
financial
resources
to
try
to
heal
themselves
and
return
to
their
lives
and
careers
.
That
is
another
,
often
overlooked
,
cost
of
sexual
misconduct
,
discrimination
and
misogyny
.
Duke’s
responses
to
this
issue
are
better
than
they
used
to
be
,
but
still
inadequate
.
Requiring
that
incoming
undergraduates
take
online
classes
,
AlcoholEdu
and
Sexual
Assault
Prevention
for
Undergraduates
,
is
a
step
,
but
no
substitute
for
in
person
required
training
and
institutional
responsibility
.
nbsp
;
While
the
Office
of
Gender
Violence
and
Prevention
offers
other
options
and
training
,
those
programs
are
based
in
the
Women’s
Center
,
a
tacit
implication
that
this
is
a
women’s
problem
,
not
a
Duke
problem
.
And
yet
,
nbsp
;
despite
the
clear
and
pervasive
problem
,
there
seems
to
be
no
urgent
response
by
Duke
to
these
numbers
.
Inviting
the
head
of
Time’s
Up
to
be
the
2019
graduation
speaker
is
a
gesture
,
now
complicated
by
her
resignation
,
but
while
men
in
power
at
Duke
continue
to
abuse
their
privilege
with
impunity
,
it
is
not
enough
.
nbsp
;
The
cultural
climate
facing
women
at
Duke
is
pernicious
;
it
is
in
need
of
meaningful
and
swift
action
to
make
Duke
a
place
where
all
can
thrive
.

Duke
is
riddled
with
contradictions
.
In
the
campus
culture
,
it’s
evidenced
by
the
rigid
social
hierarchy
in
spite
of
general
distaste
for
exclusivity
.
It’s
also
seen
in
the
suffocating
notion
of
effortless
perfection
and
the
precarious
facade
students
put
on
in
order
to
conform
.
But
in
the
wider
institutional
scheme
,
these
incongruities
are
more
evasive
,
slipping
through
the
cracks
and
crevices
of
the
administrative
infrastructure
.
My
previous
article
not
only
explored
the
importance
of
intentionality
for
first
years
,
but
also
alluded
to
just
how
decentralized
Duke
is
.
This
past
week
,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
reflect
on
my
Duke
experience
more
deeply
through
Spring
Breakthrough
,
a
four
day
seminar
in
specialized
topics
.
By
participating
in
this
program
,
my
perception
of
Duke
and
this
institution’s
place
in
the
orbit
of
higher
education
fundamentally
changed
.
As
I
attempt
to
to
sort
out
this
tidal
wave
of
insight
and
new
information
,
I
want
to
disseminate
these
perspectives
as
widely
as
possible
.
A
quick
disclaimer
to
re
evaluate
how
Duke’s
complex
hierarchy
provides
for
its
students
,
this
column
will
make
some
broad
strokes
.
Truthfully
,
a
single
column
isn’t
enough
space
to
disentangle
all
of
these
components
.
So
my
goal
is
to
ask
questions
about
the
power
dynamics
and
encourage
more
discussions
across
all
institutional
levels
.
Capitalizing
off
of
the
intelligence
and
productivity
of
young
people
,
universities
brand
themselves
as
places
to
hoist
up
the
next
generation
of
movers
and
shakers
.
To
an
extent
,
four
year
undergraduate
programs
thrive
off
of
the
professional
necessity
of
a
diploma
,
nbsp
;
catering
to
those
who
see
education
as
a
gateway
to
financial
security
.
But
aside
from
strategic
marketing
,
colleges
,
in
my
view
,
are
the
ultimate
loci
of
knowledge
production
.
This
knowledge
is
dynamic
and
ever
shifting
;
more
importantly
,
it
is
also
inextricable
from
the
world
,
the
communities
,
and
the
people
outside
of
academia
.
At
Duke
,
the
history
of
our
institution
is
rich
with
archival
materials
that
demonstrate
the
complexity
of
adhering
to
this
lofty
mission
.
On
April
10
,
1968
,
the
Academic
Council
held
an
emergency
meeting
in
response
to
student
activism
erupting
on
campus
following
the
assassination
of
Dr
.
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
.
The
activism
was
in
part
inspired
by
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
and
anti
Vietnam
war
protests
.
But
beyond
the
galvanizing
culture
of
the
1960s
,
students
used
this
national
devastation
as
a
charge
to
remedy
Duke’s
history
of
unjust
treatment
towards
non
academic
workers
;
thus
the
Silent
Vigil
unfolded
.
While
this
snapshot
of
student
activism
epitomizes
students
rallying
for
administrative
accountability
,
it
is
also
a
moment
of
re
evaluating
the
function
and
role
of
the
university
as
a
whole
.
Now
51
years
removed
,
I
think
it’s
time
to
begin
to
re
evaluate
again
.
At
that
1968
emergency
meeting
,
the
Academic
Council
drafted
a
response
to
these
underlying
issues
,
writing
Every
action
and
every
policy
implemented
by
the
university
has
repercussions
,
catalyzing
a
domino
effect
that
stretches
across
Duke’s
institutional
dominion
.
It
echoes
from
the
privilege
and
power
concentrated
in
the
Allen
Building
;
it
reverberates
in
the
dorms
of
over
worked
,
over
stressed
emerging
adults
;
it
resounds
within
the
homes
and
families
of
Duke’s
workers
academic
and
non
academic
alike
.
Even
today
we
see
these
issues
of
justice
and
morality
bubble
up
to
the
surface
soaring
sexual
assault
statistics
,
rising
tuition
,
mandating
an
alternating
seven
day
work
week
for
housekeeping
staff
the
list
goes
on
.
While
these
problems
may
not
be
strictly
academic
in
nature
,
they
still
impact
individual
lives
and
the
day
to
day
function
of
the
university
.
So
where
is
the
central
hub
of
Duke’s
motivations
?
Who
does
Duke
serve
?
How
does
Duke
identify
as
an
institution
?

According
to
the
Duke’s
governing
Mission
Statement
,
James
B
.
Duke
actively
charged
members
of
the
University
to
provide
real
leadership
in
the
educational
world
.
From
developing
this
leadership
,
Duke’s
overarching
ambition
is
to
provide
a
superior
liberal
education
to
its
undergraduate
students
.
After
all
,
Duke
is
a
liberal
arts
school
,
right
?
Interestingly
enough
,
Duke’s
defining
mission
paints
an
ideal
of
student
leadership
and
enterprising
faculty
scholarship
without
laying
out
comparable
standards
for
the
institution
itself
.
But
to
be
a
true
leader
among
our
peers
,
Duke
needs
to
stop
imitating
other
institutions
and
start
committing
to
a
central
identity
.
The
previously
mentioned
1968
Academic
Council
report
also
reveals
inconsistencies
between
the
goals
that
the
institution
touts
and
the
actions
that
it
ultimately
takes
I
am
just
one
voice
on
campus
one
among
6
,
994
undergraduates
,
8
,
898
graduate
and
professional
students
,
3
,
774
faculty
,
39
,
525
staff
,
and
looking
beyond
campus
,
an
alumni
network
amassing
167
,
848
Duke
graduates
.
So
I
realize
that
my
opinion
in
The
Chronicle
is
infinitesimal
juxtaposed
with
the
magnitude
of
these
227
,
039
lived
experiences
.
As
for
what
direction
I
believe
Duke
should
be
advancing
towards
,
I
would
recommend
several
things
a
stronger
commitment
to
unifying
the
Duke
community
as
soon
as
students
arrive
on
campus
,
more
student
input
in
the
classroom
setting
,
fortifying
networks
of
communication
across
Duke’s
institutional
silos
,
and
altogether
encouraging
a
stronger
focus
on
undergraduate
exploration
.
But
I
believe
that
we
all
have
a
responsibility
to
re
define
Duke
.
So
I
encourage
you
to
take
a
step
back
and
be
reflective
.
Re
definition
can
only
come
with
a
collective
paradigm
shift
that
aggregates
the
many
ways
in
which
we
perceive
ourselves
as
members
of
the
Duke
community
.
And
it
culminates
with
the
stark
realization
that
we
are
ultimately
the
enforcers
of
our
own
conformity
.
We
have
the
charge
and
the
ability
to
establish
higher
expectations
.
Whether
or
not
those
can
be
met
is
another
question
entirely
,
but
as
former
President
John
F
.
Kennedy
once
said
every
accomplishment
starts
with
the
decision
to
try
.
Duke
students
care
too
much
about
themselves
,
and
not
enough
about
Duke’s
community
.
Of
course
,
this
sentiment
doesn’t
apply
to
every
Duke
student
and
isn’t
completely
true
for
any
single
one
.
But
as
a
whole
,
the
student
body
at
Duke
is
entirely
more
concerned
with
themselves
,
their
friends
,
and
their
individual
extracurriculars
than
with
the
culture
and
community
at
this
school
.
To
some
extent
,
this
is
human
nature
.
We
focus
on
what’s
in
front
of
us
and
will
always
be
more
concerned
with
our
immediate
issues
than
anything
else
.
But
part
of
what
a
college
community
ought
to
do
is
counteract
that
inward
focus
and
draw
people
out
of
themselves
to
something
greater
,
to
a
wider
group
of
people
connected
on
one
campus
.
Right
now
,
that
is
wholly
lacking
at
Duke
.
A
student
will
attend
rehearsal
for
their
play
every
night
for
weeks
,
but
not
consider
how
the
performance
will
impact
the
conversation
at
Duke
.
Instead
,
they
do
it
as
a
self
contained
process
whether
for
the
people
they
act
alongside
,
the
fun
they
get
from
their
participation
,
the
knowledge
they
gain
from
the
experience
,
or
any
number
of
other
reasons
.
And
those
reasons
are
all
perfectly
valid
,
but
each
student
should
consider
one
more
reason
the
benefit
their
work
will
add
into
the
community
.
What
exactly
is
Duke
culture
,
then
?
It’s
in
the
dominant
conversations
happening
on
campus
what
you
talk
about
at
dinner
in
West
Union
or
what
you
overhear
on
the
C1
.
It’s
in
whether
you
try
to
form
relationships
with
your
professors
or
simply
complete
the
class
.
It’s
in
the
judgement
or
lack
thereof
when
you
choose
to
go
to
a
Devils
After
Dark
event
rather
than
Devines
.
In
short
,
it’s
the
way
we
all
feed
back
into
one
another
onto
campus
.
Right
now
,
that
feedback
loop
exists
,
but
it
isn’t
talked
about
.
When
we
do
something
,
we
usually
don’t
try
to
affect
it
at
all
but
we
should
.
The
perfect
microcosm
for
this
issue
is
Duke
Student
Government
.
Why
does
no
one
know
what
they
do
?
Why
did
fewer
people
vote
this
year
than
last
year
and
in
either
case
,
why
does
that
number
only
equal
about
a
third
of
undergraduate
students
?
nbsp
;
Why
did
we
only
have
one
candidate
for
DSG
vice
president
?
nbsp
;
DSG
should
play
a
much
more
visible
role
on
campus
,
shaping
the
conversation
and
defining
the
culture
.
But
since
there’s
little
conversation
or
culture
in
the
first
place
or
at
least
,
no
one
care
enough
to
think
about
what
we
currently
have
the
role
of
DSG
is
currently
ineffectual
.
This
issue
is
much
more
pronounced
at
Duke
because
many
Duke
students
are
so
career
oriented
.
If
something
isn’t
listable
as
a
bullet
point
on
a
resume
,
it
may
as
well
not
exist
.
Which
is
why
even
as
we
raise
thousands
of
dollars
for
donations
or
rebuild
communities
through
DukeEngage
both
great
things
Duke
students
should
definitely
continue
to
do
,
something
as
un
quantifiable
as
the
Duke
culture
gets
left
by
the
wayside
.
Of
course
,
the
easy
answer
is
that
we
care
about
that
side
of
our
work
,
that
what
the
whole
Duke
community
gets
out
of
our
efforts
is
irrelevant
.
After
all
,
if
it’s
so
hard
to
see
the
benefit
or
effect
,
is
it
even
there
?
But
that
mindset
is
the
problem
in
itself
.
When
we
abandon
any
investment
in
the
Duke
community
,
we
don’t
get
the
dividends
the
school
wide
pride
,
the
warmth
of
a
tight
knit
community
,
or
the
interplay
between
the
efforts
of
diverse
groups
.
There
is
a
reason
I
identify
more
with
my
sub
groups
at
Duke
my
friends
,
my
fraternity
,
my
clubs
than
with
the
school
as
a
whole
.
Sure
,
Duke
basketball
takes
some
of
that
role
we
almost
all
identify
universally
with
the
team
.
But
I’m
talking
about
spirit
;
I
want
to
identify
with
the
institution
of
Duke
,
and
I
don’t
right
now
.
nbsp
;
I’m
trying
to
change
that
in
myself
,
to
be
more
mindful
of
the
good
I
can
give
back
to
the
whole
campus
,
but
it’s
hard
.
It
starts
with
this
column
,
and
hopefully
continues
in
my
role
as
philanthropy
chair
of
my
fraternity
and
in
my
work
with
the
other
clubs
I’m
in
.
The
problem
is
that
it’s
much
more
difficult
for
me
and
everyone
else
to
contribute
to
campus
when
the
culture
is
one
of
apathy
,
not
engagement
.
We
need
to
overhaul
the
culture
at
Duke
,
and
it
starts
by
talking
about
it
.
Once
we
can
acknowledge
and
discuss
what’s
happening
here
,
we
can
start
engaging
with
it
in
our
day
to
day
activities
.
We
can
be
mindful
about
how
our
extracurriculars
will
impact
the
community
,
or
how
DSG
shapes
the
everyday
life
of
Duke
students
and
what’s
more
,
we
can
start
taking
steps
to
amplify
that
impact
and
make
it
more
productive
.

bros
,
sell
outs
and
snakes
these
colloquial
terms
have
found
homes
in
our
vocabulary
,
and
we
regularly
make
memes
of
these
stereotypes
in
mockery
.
Yet
,
after
the
laughter
dies
down
,
we
still
find
ourselves
applying
to
these
jobs
in
finance
and
consulting
.
Despite
accusations
of
McKinsey
encouraging
bribery
and
supporting
authoritarian
governments
or
Facebook
placing
our
democracy
at
stake
,
year
after
year
I
hear
of
my
peers
signing
offers
to
join
these
same
firms
.
And
while
it’s
true
that
social
good
or
social
impact
departments
within
these
companies
exist
,
if
you
even
need
a
specific
department
labeled
as
social
good
,
what
does
that
say
about
the
company
overall
?
The
most
common
justification
for
working
at
these
firms
that
I’ve
heard
is
that
it
is
a
foolproof
way
to
build
important
skills
,
from
problem
solving
to
teamwork
.
People
describe
to
me
only
short
term
plans
to
stay
in
this
rigorous
and
grueling
industry
,
in
order
to
arm
themselves
with
an
arsenal
of
skills
before
switching
out
to
something
else
.
These
well
paying
jobs
can
often
be
a
treated
as
a
way
to
afford
true
passions
or
hobbies
,
whether
it’s
checking
out
new
restaurants
on
the
weekend
or
if
it’s
financially
supporting
a
grassroots
organization
that
you
care
about
.
But
when
people
often
leave
this
industry
unhappy
after
a
short
two
year
tenure
,
perhaps
the
ends
do
not
justify
the
means
.
Let
me
be
quick
to
hop
off
of
any
moral
high
horse
that
it
may
seem
like
I’m
on
.
In
fact
,
I’ll
be
the
first
to
admit
that
I’m
no
angel
either
a
quick
LinkedIn
stalking
of
me
will
reveal
that
I’ve
worked
for
a
financial
company
in
my
past
too
.
But
this
is
in
part
what
has
contributed
to
my
current
belief
that
the
ends
do
not
necessarily
justify
the
means
with
respect
to
professional
choices
.
So
why
,
then
,
did
I
sign
an
offer
for
last
summer
to
work
for
one
of
these
firms
,
when
I
knew
it
did
not
align
with
my
true
passions
and
values
?
It’s
especially
off
putting
when
I
realize
that
when
I
was
a
freshman
,
none
of
my
friends
even
knew
what
consulting
or
investment
banking
really
entailed
.
Yet
,
according
to
Duke’s
Senior
Survey
in
2018
,
the
two
industries
of
finance
and
consulting
alone
accounted
for
21
percent
of
jobs
for
new
Duke
graduates
.
Add
in
the
tech
industry
,
and
that
number
jumps
to
almost
38
percent
.
Perhaps
these
statistics
seems
normal
if
you
think
about
how
finance
,
consulting
and
tech
really
do
make
up
the
meat
of
the
American
economy
other
jobs
arguably
lie
in
the
margins
.
Regardless
,
these
industries
employ
recruitment
strategies
that
attract
not
only
economics
majors
,
but
also
students
from
seemingly
unrelated
fields
like
sociology
and
English
.
Wall
Street’s
classic
two
and
out
program
structure
,
in
which
new
employees
join
firms
for
just
two
years
,
makes
it
an
appealing
temporary
home
for
recent
college
graduates
looking
for
a
sense
of
stability
without
commitment
.
In
his
book
Young
Money
,
Kevin
Roose
describes
a
scene
that
we
are
all
too
familiar
with
big
name
companies
wining
and
dining
impressionable
students
,
handing
out
free
swag
,
and
offering
massive
paychecks
.
With
all
of
these
incentives
,
it’s
easy
to
find
ourselves
competing
for
jobs
that
we
had
either
never
heard
of
before
or
had
thought
of
as
dull
and
lacking
much
social
purpose
.
nbsp
;
A
study
from
sociologist
Amy
J
.
Binder
of
Harvard
undergraduates
reached
the
same
conclusion
that
the
vast
presence
of
on
campus
,
structured
recruitment
every
fall
for
finance
and
consulting
gets
students’
attention
,
plays
on
their
competitiveness
,
and
leads
them
to
apply
to
jobs
that
,
only
a
year
or
two
earlier
,
they
had
never
heard
of
.
I
logged
in
to
Duke
CareerConnection’s
Employer
Hosted
Events
front
page
to
see
how
accessible
finance
and
consulting
is
on
campus
.
Of
the
15
events
on
the
first
page
,
12
were
from
companies
in
the
finance
or
consulting
industries
.
There’s
no
doubt
that
Duke
has
a
proclivity
for
the
pre
professional
,
but
the
question
at
hand
is
Is
Duke
as
an
institution
actively
encouraging
students
to
enter
these
industries
over
exploring
other
fields
,
or
is
it
simply
responding
to
a
pre
existing
demand
?
Outside
of
Duke’s
campus
,
it’s
reasonable
to
attribute
this
whole
dilemma
of
students
flocking
to
finance
and
consulting
as
a
product
of
capitalism
.
Financial
firms
,
tech
companies
and
similar
businesses
tend
to
pay
incredibly
well
,
and
college
kids
enjoy
spending
their
summers
in
big
cities
.
Perhaps
it’s
natural
that
we
gravitate
towards
these
high
paying
jobs
that
just
so
happen
to
not
be
the
most
morally
clean
.
In
the
same
vein
,
the
way
that
capitalism
has
prioritized
these
industries
means
that
pursuing
one’s
true
passions
is
very
much
an
act
of
privilege
.
Not
everyone
has
parents
that
can
subsidize
summer
housing
or
relieve
other
financial
burdens
,
and
I
can’t
expect
someone
to
be
willing
to
work
on
a
13
hour
salary
when
I
don’t
know
their
background
or
what
they
are
financially
supporting
.
For
some
,
the
high
income
that
these
firms
provide
is
a
necessity
.

But
outside
of
these
special
cases
,
and
especially
when
69
percent
of
Duke
students
come
from
the
top
20
percent
of
America
in
terms
of
income
,
the
flocking
to
consulting
info
sessions
that
happens
every
year
just
doesn’t
sit
right
with
me
.
Even
though
the
careers
that
may
align
better
with
our
real
passions
aren’t
as
accessible
on
campus
as
finance
and
consulting
,
we
should
still
put
in
the
time
and
effort
to
seek
them
even
if
it
means
turning
away
from
the
path
of
least
resistance
.
I
often
ask
my
friends
the
question
,
When
you
were
younger
,
what
did
you
want
to
be
?
The
way
this
question
is
framed
seems
to
imply
the
career
as
a
state
of
being
,
an
intimate
role
tied
to
who
you
are
as
a
person
.
If
this
is
true
,
we
ought
to
hold
our
professional
choices
to
the
same
standards
that
we
hold
ourselves
to
as
people
.
As
a
senior
biomedical
engineering
BME
and
electrical
and
computer
ECE
double
major
,
Duke
BME
was
quite
the
experience
.
Biomedical
engineering
is
a
broad
field
,
and
the
coursework
for
the
major
follows
a
fitting
path
,
exposing
undergraduates
to
many
different
areas
.
I
learned
basics
starting
at
cellular
biology
and
differential
equations
to
eclectic
topics
like
materials
science
and
physiology
,
to
modern
technologies
including
diagnostic
imaging
and
medical
device
software
design
.
This
approach
has
its
benefits
as
well
as
its
drawbacks
on
one
hand
,
I
got
a
taste
of
how
broad
the
field
really
is
and
learned
a
little
bit
of
everything
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
the
major
lacked
a
cohesive
picture
of
what
I
was
really
meant
to
take
away
from
it
.
The
BME
curriculum
can
be
divided
into
a
few
categories
first
,
mathematics
and
natural
sciences
,
which
are
introductory
level
classes
like
physics
,
chemistry
and
biology
.
Next
are
rudimentary
BME
classes
which
are
typically
taken
late
sophomore
and
early
junior
year
,
including
physiology
,
mechanics
of
solids
,
structure
and
properties
of
solids
,
modeling
cellular
and
molecular
systems
,
and
signals
and
systems
.
Last
are
the
upper
level
electives
,
or
area
cores
,
which
include
both
introductions
to
specific
fields
and
their
corresponding
upper
level
electives
,
including
imaging
,
biomechanics
and
electrobiology
,
as
well
as
a
senior
design
course
.
The
curriculum
is
designed
to
narrow
down
to
specific
areas
after
an
initial
broad
exposure
to
different
topics
so
that
the
student
can
eventually
specialize
.
A
heavy
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
interdisciplinary
factor
.
Students’
coursework
draws
from
electrical
engineering
,
mechanical
engineering
and
various
fields
in
biomedical
engineering
.
While
a
good
idea
in
theory
,
I
spent
so
much
time
getting
past
the
intro
level
courses
that
it
wasn’t
until
late
junior
year
that
I
was
finally
able
to
learn
in
depth
about
a
topic
.
My
first
ECE
class
,
ECE110
Fundamentals
of
ECE
was
awesome
;
it
offered
me
a
solid
overview
and
introduction
to
the
field
.
The
lecture
taught
both
digital
and
analog
electronics
concepts
,
and
the
laboratory
component
involved
hardware
tinkering
and
as
well
as
software
skills
.
In
contrast
,
the
first
BME
class
BME244
Quantitative
Physiology
with
Biostatistical
Applications
was
disappointing
.
It
was
plain
old
physiology
,
very
little
problem
solving
,
and
one
of
the
labs
had
me
pee
in
a
cup
for
science
.
Why
couldn’t
my
first
BME
class
actually
introduce
BME
?
With
plenty
of
area
cores
available
,
why
didn’t
the
first
class
I
took
offer
a
peek
into
each
of
those
cool
areas
?
The
frustration
continued
in
the
next
few
BME
classes
,
as
many
classes
led
nowhere
for
me
.
EGR201
was
a
repeat
of
Physics
151
Introductory
Mechanics
;
ME221
Structure
and
Properties
of
Solids
taught
me
things
I
had
already
learned
in
my
ECE
classes
,
chemistry
,
and
some
stuff
about
steel
;
and
I’m
not
sure
what
BME260
Cellular
Modeling
was
actually
about
.
These
were
graduation
requirements
that
were
considered
necessary
for
some
areas
of
BME
,
but
had
very
little
content
relevant
to
the
area
cores
I
wanted
to
pick
.
While
the
original
motivation
behind
requiring
students
to
engage
in
this
broad
curricula
seems
good
having
students
learn
about
a
few
areas
before
delving
more
deeply
the
classes
should
still
have
maintained
an
emphasis
on
BME
.
The
only
thing
close
to
being
relevant
to
BME
that
I
learned
in
ME221
was
titanium
has
good
properties
for
implants
.
Why
isn’t
this
material
instead
taught
by
the
BME
department
,
actually
relevant
to
BME
,
and
condensed
into
one
semester
instead
of
two
?
The
opportunity
cost
for
those
who
opt
not
to
delve
deeper
in
that
area
is
a
semester
spent
on
a
class
they
could
have
instead
spent
learning
other
skills
that
make
BME
majors
even
more
flexible
or
interdisciplinary
,
such
as
a
computer
science
course
.
While
other
majors
have
similar
classes
that
can
be
argued
to
be
pointless
,
it's
a
bigger
problem
for
BME
because
of
the
amount
of
prerequisite
coursework
needed
,
limiting
the
number
of
higher
level
electives
that
can
be
taken
.
I
recently
spoke
with
another
senior
BME
major
who
said
he
felt
that
he
wasn’t
really
challenged
or
interested
academically
until
the
advanced
BME
electives
,
classes
where
he
really
learned
what
he
came
to
Duke
wanting
to
learn
.
For
a
lot
of
students
,
this
meandering
the
first
two
years
causes
them
to
lose
interest
in
BME
and
engineering
.
It’s
reasonable
that
the
department
would
like
students
to
develop
a
solid
academic
foundation
through
the
first
two
years
,
but
these
introductory
classes
unfortunately
become
'
weed
out
classes
'
for
lack
of
interest
,
rather
than
lack
of
trying
,
the
senior
continued
.
Understandably
,
this
is
something
that
many
BME
departments
across
the
nation
struggle
with
the
field
is
vast
,
relatively
new
,
and
educators
are
still
trying
to
figure
out
the
best
approach
to
designing
a
rewarding
curriculum
.
Many
believe
that
Pratt
is
taking
the
curriculum
in
the
right
direction
with
its
initiatives
for
engineering
design
focused
education
.
With
the
rollout
of
the
BME
Design
Fellows
,
as
well
as
the
freshly
implemented
first
year
design
class
that
is
now
mandatory
for
all
incoming
Pratt
students
,
students
are
being
equipped
with
skills
that
are
useful
in
engineering
industry
.
Greg
Goldman
,
a
BME
ECE
senior
,
wrote
in
an
email
that
the
BME
design
fellow
program
has
been
great
in
supporting
the
effort
to
prepare
for
a
practical
engineering
role
.
Albeit
still
a
bit
disorganized
during
the
first
semester
,
the
design
fellow
program
partnered
with
some
companies
,
helped
students
find
internships
and
provided
a
seminar
to
teach
some
design
skills
.
This
support
and
focus
on
career
oriented
engineering
was
just
what
I
had
hoped
to
find
.
However
,
while
on
the
right
track
,
there
are
still
a
few
more
things
that
Duke
BME
can
improve
on
In
almost
any
conversation
about
future
plans
with
my
fellow
students
at
Duke
,
I
catch
myself
wondering
how
anyone
is
so
sure
about
what
they
want
to
do
with
their
lives
.
At
19
years
old
you’ve
already
decided
that
you’re
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
as
a
doctor
,
mathematician
,
or
software
engineer
?
Or
,
alternatively
,
you’ve
hedged
all
your
bets
on
getting
a
consulting
job
upon
graduation
?
Now
,
that’s
not
to
say
that
people
can’t
change
their
minds
and
pivot
to
a
different
field
or
career
but
Duke
students
act
as
if
their
chosen
path
is
an
absolute
certainty
.
We
spend
hundreds
of
hours
in
the
library
,
skip
out
on
Duke
basketball
games
and
social
events
,
miss
amazing
speakers
and
cultural
events
all
to
secure
a
sky
high
GPA
that
will
open
the
door
to
prestigious
graduate
schools
or
high
paying
jobs
.
We
make
sure
the
next
phase
of
our
lives
is
filled
with
bigger
,
better
and
more
impressive
things
.
We
bolster
our
already
crammed
resumes
,
secure
research
positions
and
aim
for
some
of
the
world’s
best
summer
internships
just
to
maintain
our
places
in
the
rat
race
that
is
chasing
money
,
success
and
status
.
Why
?
That’s
how
success
has
been
defined
for
us
.
We
live
in
a
capitalistic
world
that
runs
not
on
Dunkin’
but
on
dollar
bills
,
fame
,
and
securing
the
most
impressive
credentials
.
We
teach
our
kids
,
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
,
that
doing
well
means
getting
good
grades
,
securing
a
position
with
Facebook
,
or
getting
into
a
top
25
medical
school
.
It’s
also
great
to
learn
to
grind
and
work
for
what
you
want
,
but
how
are
you
so
sure
that
you’ve
even
found
something
you
really
want
?
When
my
inner
monologue
eventually
reaches
this
conclusion
,
as
it
always
does
,
I
get
angry
.
Duke
students
are
mostly
young
people
,
but
we
are
all
conditioned
to
follow
others’
definitions
of
what
our
lives
should
be
.
Granted
,
I’m
sure
it’s
not
helped
by
the
helicopter
moms
and
dads
that
have
planned
out
our
lives
at
every
stage
,
nor
by
being
surrounded
by
others
that
seem
to
have
internalized
the
same
ideas
about
wealth
,
impressiveness
and
resume
building
.
But
despite
our
society
collectively
agreeing
on
this
being
the
right
path
to
follow
,
it’s
still
bullsh
t
.
Duke
students
are
,
on
average
,
one
fourth
of
the
way
through
our
entire
lives
if
we
live
to
80
or
so
and
already
we
have
dedicated
our
existence
on
this
tiny
rock
that
orbits
an
unimpressive
star
to
maximizing
our
potential
success
in
whatever
careers
we
have
been
to
seek
.
As
I
consider
our
limited
definitions
of
success
and
the
small
number
of
paths
that
we
feel
permitted
to
follow
in
life
,
I
realize
that
we
are
not
even
doing
what
the
most
traditionally
successful
people
advise
us
to
do
.
CEOs
,
billionaires
,
and
celebrities
frequently
say
that
in
your
20s
while
you’re
still
young
,
you
should
try
to
travel
,
experience
new
things
,
get
the
hell
out
of
your
comfort
zone
,
and
try
to
figure
out
what
really
makes
you
.
Granted
,
it’s
a
privilege
to
have
the
means
to
travel
and
many
experiences
cost
money
but
Duke
has
so
many
resources
to
help
us
out
.
We
are
blessed
to
have
DukeEngage
,
study
abroad
opportunities
that
are
cheaper
than
our
tuition
,
and
so
many
other
cool
speakers
,
events
and
people
to
help
us
figure
out
our
place
in
the
world
.
Nonetheless
,
we
are
not
taking
the
advice
even
of
the
figures
that
we
consider
the
most
successful
.
We
skip
study
abroad
to
prepare
for
tech
recruiting
,
set
ourselves
up
for
lifestyles
designed
to
maximize
our
comfort
,
and
never
leave
a
spare
moment
to
think
about
who
and
what
we
really
want
to
be
.
We
just
mimic
those
around
us
and
before
us
,
follow
our
parents’
career
guidance
,
and
generally
accept
the
way
of
the
world
as
a
foregone
conclusion
.
Coming
into
Duke
,
I
decided
that
my
goal
was
to
work
for
a
top
tech
company
because
I
believed
that
a
Facebook
,
Microsoft
or
Google
job
was
the
way
that
I
could
show
people
that
I
had
succeeded
.
I
wanted
it
as
an
addition
to
my
resume
and
as
a
key
that
would
unlock
many
doors
for
me
.
And
that
thought
made
sense
;
landing
an
offer
from
a
big
tech
company
would
make
things
easier
for
me
long
term
.
I
would
have
a
fairly
stable
career
and
plenty
of
opportunity
for
advancement
.
And
even
grinding
for
the
next
two
years
to
achieve
it
would
make
sense
in
terms
of
stability
or
from
a
financial
standpoint
,
but
in
the
past
year
I’ve
come
to
value
not
being
tied
down
and
I’ve
sought
out
unique
experiences
.
I’ve
realized
how
much
I
would
miss
if
I
wanted
to
fulfill
every
item
on
the
Facebook
recruiter’s
checklist
,
and
decided
recently
that
that
life
is
not
for
me
,
especially
when
I’m
not
even
sure
if
I
want
to
be
working
in
the
software
industry
.
I’ve
come
to
realize
that
I
do
not
want
that
top
tech
internship
,
despite
how
well
it
might
set
me
up
for
the
rest
of
my
life
if
I
would
acquire
it
.
I
know
that
not
everyone
is
comfortable
with
the
uncertainty
that
comes
from
not
knowing
the
future
,
and
that
it’s
scary
to
admit
you
have
no
idea
what
you
want
to
do
or
why
you
want
to
do
it
.
But
choosing
the
future
trajectory
of
your
life
should
not
be
you
choosing
the
safest
or
most
lucrative
path
.
And
committing
so
strongly
to
that
path
so
early
on
in
your
life
will
undoubtedly
cause
you
to
miss
out
on
other
opportunities
for
exploring
other
fields
and
exploring
who
you
really
are
.
And
since
it
seems
like
half
of
the
student
body
at
Duke
acts
like
their
future
is
set
in
stone
,
I
have
one
question
for
you
,
fellow
college
students
why
are
you
already
acting
as
if
this
path
that
you
have
been
greatly
influenced
to
follow
is
your
life
?
Imagine
this
Coach
K
sets
his
rules
for
the
upcoming
game
everyone
must
be
at
practice
.
Every
day
,
on
time
,
no
exceptions
.
One
afternoon
,
all
of
the
team’s
starters
decided
to
show
up
an
hour
late
to
practice
.
The
rule
says
they
should
be
suspended
for
one
full
week
,
which
means
they
will
not
play
against
UNC
.
.
.
But
the
whole
team
,
not
to
mention
K
Ville
,
is
depending
on
them
.
What
should
Coach
do
?
This
dilemma
was
presented
to
middle
schoolers
at
Smith
Middle
School
in
Chapel
Hill
last
week
.
A
few
members
of
Duke
Honor
Council
visited
Smith
to
teach
and
talk
with
sixth
graders
about
honor
.
We
began
by
presenting
these
ethical
dilemmas
.
The
middle
schoolers
moved
to
one
side
of
the
room
in
support
of
the
players
being
allowed
to
play
and
the
other
side
for
the
players
not
being
allowed
to
play
.
A
student
in
the
back
raised
his
hand
and
started
with
an
unrelated
question
,
but
do
you
think
Duke
is
gonna
sue
Nike
?
More
students
began
sharing
their
thoughts
.
They
delved
into
more
complexity
than
I
had
anticipated
.
For
instance
,
one
student
said
that
she
thinks
the
coach
should
not
prevent
the
players
from
playing
until
talking
with
them
because
what
if
their
dog
had
died
,
and
they
were
at
home
feeling
sad
.
Another
student
argued
that
she
would
support
the
coach
preventing
the
players
from
playing
because
in
that
case
,
benchwarmers
would
have
a
turn
on
the
court
.
Overall
,
middle
schoolers
seemed
to
focus
on
the
feelings
of
the
players
,
as
opposed
to
the
logistics
of
the
rule
,
perhaps
due
to
that
middle
school
emotional
lability
,
but
also
to
give
insight
into
people’s
motivations
.
When
talking
about
the
different
ethical
dilemmas
and
what
terms
like
honor
,
moral
courage
,
cheating
and
plagiarism
mean
,
the
students
recognized
the
interconnectivity
of
these
concepts
for
example
,
how
cheating
leads
to
dire
consequences
for
the
cheater
but
also
affects
other
students
in
the
classroom
.
They
also
exhibited
great
empathy
when
,
for
instance
,
talking
about
how
it
would
make
a
friend
feel
if
they
lied
to
them
.
We
have
much
to
learn
from
these
middle
schoolers
.
Younger
people
tend
to
be
more
curious
than
critical
of
those
around
them
.
A
middle
schooler
may
welcome
an
unfamiliar
face
on
a
bus
more
readily
than
we
might
.
The
ability
to
recognize
that
at
times
we
will
all
be
the
new
and
unfamiliar
person
on
the
bus
needing
a
seat
and
to
respect
the
dignity
in
fellow
humans
is
admirable
.
As
Duke
students
,
we
can
learn
to
better
relate
to
and
interact
with
people
outside
of
the
Duke
bubble
.
We
should
strive
for
the
middle
schoolers’
curiosity
.
Once
we
are
curious
and
care
enough
to
learn
about
those
around
us
,
their
beliefs
and
values
,
we
can
listen
and
empathize
with
them
.
This
empathy
is
necessary
for
healthy
relationships
between
students
and
Duke
and
Durham
.
Safety
is
not
explicitly
laid
out
in
the
Community
Standard
.
However
,
the
Community
Standard
does
establish
trust
as
a
baseline
for
our
behavior
,
leading
to
a
communal
feeling
of
security
and
care
between
students
and
community
members
.
The
Community
Standard
does
not
limit
our
expressions
of
trust
,
respect
and
integrity
to
within
the
Duke
bubble
.
Rather
,
because
we
are
ambassadors
of
Duke
to
people
outside
of
its
realm
,
we
should
uphold
the
Standard
in
those
situations
especially
.
In
Durham
,
we
should
act
if
we
see
wrong
.
We
should
respect
Durham
community
members
in
the
same
way
we
treat
ourselves
and
our
fellow
Duke
students
as
we
assume
the
best
of
our
classmates
,
we
should
not
lay
judgments
on
those
outside
the
Duke
bubble
.
Duke
is
not
an
isolated
island
floating
at
sea
Duke
community
members
are
interconnected
with
Durham
,
and
it
is
our
responsibility
to
engage
in
the
space
we
inhabit
in
an
honorable
way
.
Duke
Honor
Council’s
goal
is
to
promote
the
Duke
Community
Standard
and
its
core
ideals
of
honesty
,
fairness
,
respect
and
accountability
.
The
basis
of
The
Community
Standard
is
about
treating
others
as
you
want
to
be
treated
and
acting
if
you
see
something
wrong
.
Middle
schoolers
can
also
teach
us
something
about
what
is
wrong
in
academic
settings
.
When
we
talked
about
academic
integrity
defining
cheating
,
plagiarizing
,
and
discussing
strategies
to
do
the
right
thing
the
middle
school
students
saw
that
avoiding
cheating
and
plagiarizing
only
requires
doing
your
own
work
.
Academic
pressures
can
blind
Duke
students
to
these
middle
schoolers’
common
sense
.
Middle
schoolers
could
remind
Duke
students
that
doing
one’s
own
work
means
without
the
aid
of
Adderall
or
a
computer
science
friend
who
already
completed
their
code

At
the
end
of
our
day
at
Smith
Middle
School
,
we
weaved
our
way
through
the
hallway
,
hearing
shouts
and
lockers
slam
.
Though
they
might
not
have
taken
organic
chemistry
or
read
War
and
Peace
,
we
have
much
to
learn
from
these
middle
schoolers
.
They
remind
us
that
acting
honorably
in
social
settings
requires
empathy
to
treat
others
with
human
dignity
,
and
in
academia
,
requires
honest
common
sense
.
The
Black
Men’s
Union
executive
board
recently
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
with
three
candidates
for
President
.
We
all
were
extremely
impressed
with
the
thoughtfulness
and
range
of
experiences
represented
by
the
candidates
this
year
.
We
are
extremely
grateful
that
we
got
to
engage
in
productive
conversation
with
all
of
them
.

Black
Men’s
Union
Executive
Board
Last
week
,
the
ivory
tower
was
stunned
by
the
news
of
a
college
admissions
fraud
scandal
connected
to
a
number
of
prestigious
higher
education
institutions
.
Dubbed
Operation
Varsity
Blues
,
the
FBI
charged
fifty
people
in
six
states
including
famous
actresses
,
business
leaders
and
other
well
heeled
parents
for
involvement
in
a
nationwide
bribery
and
fraud
scheme
to
help
their
children
gain
admission
to
elite
colleges
and
universities
.
Also
accused
are
top
college
athletic
coaches
for
facilitating
the
scheme
by
pretending
to
recruit
the
students
as
top
athletes
and
the
SAT
proctors
who
helped
the
students
falsify
their
scores
.
For
the
cynics
among
us
,
this
scandal
may
not
have
seemed
so
scandalous
.
The
college
admissions
process
is
rife
with
glaring
and
entirely
legal
inequity
on
nearly
every
front
.
Both
recruited
athletes
and
students
with
high
SAT
scores
are
disproportionately
wealthy
,
and
their
ability
to
jettison
to
these
ranks
is
largely
due
to
the
resources
their
class
status
affords
them
.
In
fact
,
even
the
College
Board’s
own
data
shows
that
wealthy
students
from
college
educated
families
are
more
likely
to
excel
on
the
test
.
Zip
code
income
disparities
and
fewer
educational
opportunities
play
an
influential
part
in
limiting
lower
income
students'
options
as
well
.
The
National
Center
for
Education
Statistics
found
that
even
after
local
and
state
governments
increased
education
spending
,
educational
inequity
persisted
,
in
part
because
many
states
primarily
finance
schools
through
local
property
taxes
.
In
terms
of
the
federal
funding
,
chronic
funding
problems
for
public
schools
will
only
be
exacerbated
as
President
Donald
Trump
calls
for
a
12
percent
or
7
.
1
billion
cut
to
funding
at
the
Department
of
Education
,
a
major
budget
cut
for
the
third
year
in
a
row
.
A
year
ago
,
the
U
.
S
.
Commission
on
Civil
Rights
published
a
report
,
Public
Education
Funding
Equity
In
an
Era
of
Increasing
Concentration
of
Poverty
and
Resegregation
,
on
how
residential
segregation
led
to
inequity
in
educational
opportunities
.
It
allows
for
higher
income
neighborhoods
to
fund
predominantly
white
school
districts
with
larger
sums
of
local
tax
revenue
,
while
lower
income
neighborhoods
with
more
people
of
color
are
left
with
comparatively
under
subsidized
facilities
,
teachers
and
class
materials
.
This
issue
has
led
to
desperate
parents
being
sent
to
jail
for
lying
about
residency
in
an
attempt
to
get
their
children
into
the
better
school
districts
with
better
opportunities
.
Despite
a
diversifying
overall
population
,
the
United
States
still
remains
deeply
segregated
according
to
census
data
.
This
is
especially
true
for
Black
Americans
due
to
the
legacy
of
segregation
from
the
Reconstruction
and
Jim
Crow
eras
and
endemic
racial
preferences
among
white
people
who
choose
to
live
with
other
white
people
.
There
are
still
a
number
of
legal
ways
rich
parents
can
cheat
the
supposedly
meritocratic
college
admissions
game
.
Duke
has
not
been
scathed
by
this
scandal
,
but
at
the
University
and
beyond
,
the
legacy
preference
persists
as
a
nepotistic
mechanism
to
ensure
that
power
and
wealth
are
preserved
inter
generationally
within
predominantly
white
,
affluent
genealogies
that
are
already
disproportionately
represented
in
college
.
At
Dartmouth
,
Princeton
,
Yale
,
Penn
,
Brown
and
33
other
colleges
including
Duke
,
there
are
more
students
from
families
in
the
top
1
percent
than
from
the
bottom
60
percent
.
University
attendance
has
always
been
a
status
symbol
to
facilitate
a
branding
and
perception
of
successful
parenting
for
rich
families
.
As
such
,
meritocracy
is
a
myth
,
and
it
would
be
irresponsible
and
myopic
to
pretend
otherwise
.
Outrage
over
the
boogeyman
of
the
undocumented
valedictorian
student
or
that
Black
or
Latinx
student
with
the
race
card
maliciously
stealing
a
spot
from
deserving
students
is
misplaced
and
disingenuous
.
With
the
cards
of
historical
socioeconomic
inequity
stacked
up
against
them
,
disadvantaged
low
income
students
of
color
know
best
how
they
have
had
to
move
heaven
and
Earth
in
order
to
get
their
feet
into
the
doors
of
prestigious
universities
.
The
rules
of
the
game
have
always
been
unfair
,
and
the
legal
parameters
around
what
actions
are
acceptable
feel
rather
meaningless
when
you
were
never
meant
to
win
in
the
first
place
.
First
year
Amory
Williams'
work
space
was
the
epitome
of
a
study
sprawl
Tuesday
night
.
You
walk
into
class
on
the
day
of
the
midterm
and
slide
into
your
usual
seat
.
The
bags
under
your
eyes
are
more
pronounced
than
usual
after
the
many
hours
you
spent
cramming
last
night
in
Perkins
.
Hiding
your
sweaty
palms
under
your
thighs
,
you
lean
over
to
the
person
sitting
next
to
you
.
I
didn’t
study
at
all
for
this
.
If
you
haven’t
been
this
person
,
you’ve
definitely
heard
this
phrase
plenty
of
times
.
Duke
students
can
be
habitual
liars
when
it
comes
to
our
academic
habits
.
We
say
we
know
nothing
when
we
know
plenty
and
claim
we’re
going
to
fail
when
we’re
shooting
for
an
A
.
Why
?
It’s
no
secret
that
Duke’s
academic
environment
is
highly
competitive
.
But
what
people
often
fail
to
recognize
is
how
much
of
our
personal
value
we
place
in
our
academic
success
,
especially
relative
to
the
success
of
our
peers
.
Imposter
syndrome
the
feeling
that
you’re
the
only
one
here
that
doesn’t
belong
permeates
most
corners
of
campus
in
one
form
or
another
.
In
the
face
of
crippling
insecurity
,
this
feeling
forces
us
to
prove
that
we
deserve
to
be
here
.
In
order
to
prove
ourselves
,
we
can’t
just
be
smart
we
have
to
be
smarter
than
those
around
us
.
The
problem
,
however
,
is
that
this
won’t
always
be
the
case
.
In
classes
with
such
high
achieving
students
,
we
can’t
always
snag
a
spot
in
the
top
tier
.
Consequently
,
we
seek
alternative
methods
to
appear
to
fit
in
.
Lying
about
how
much
we
study
,
then
,
becomes
much
more
appealing
.
Regardless
of
how
much
you
actually
study
and
let’s
be
honest
,
most
of
us
are
working
our
butts
off
,
you
can
manipulate
your
speech
to
maximize
your
reputational
gain
.
If
you
say
you
didn’t
study
for
an
exam
and
then
end
up
acing
it
,
it’ll
seem
like
you’re
naturally
brilliant
.
And
if
you
bomb
the
exam
,
it’ll
make
sense
,
because
for
all
anyone
else
knows
,
you
barely
tried
anyways
.
Of
course
,
if
you
had
put
in
the
effort
,
you
could’ve
killed
it
.
These
mind
games
are
merely
tools
of
self
preservation
.
Most
of
us
do
truly
value
hard
work
and
determination
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
being
a
genius
is
better
than
being
a
hard
worker
,
and
being
apathetic
is
better
than
being
dumb
.
By
maintaining
an
illusion
of
innate
,
nonchalant
intellect
,
we
assert
to
everyone
else
that
we
do
belong
at
Duke
.
Even
when
we
don’t
feel
like
it
ourselves
.
Take
the
recent
case
of
research
fraud
at
Duke
.
Erin
Potts
Kant
,
a
Duke
Health
researcher
,
allegedly
falsified
data
on
a
whopping
12
papers
,
and
now
the
entire
university
is
paying
for
it
.
Circumstantially
it’s
an
outlier
,
but
the
possible
motives
behind
the
forged
data
are
all
too
common
.
Regardless
of
whatever
is
going
on
behind
the
scenes
,
the
most
important
thing
is
maintaining
an
illusion
of
perfection
.
Many
of
us
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
keep
that
up
and
,
like
Duke’s
112
.
5
million
settlement
,
the
costs
can
be
exorbitant
.
Besides
being
incredibly
damaging
to
our
self
images
,
this
philosophy
is
destructive
to
every
other
student
who
comes
in
contact
with
it
.
It
raises
the
bar
so
unreasonably
high
even
geniuses
have
to
work
hard
sometimes
,
after
all
that
it’s
extremely
difficult
to
ever
feel
smart
enough
.
At
that
point
,
the
student
has
two
choices
either
wallow
in
their
insecurities
or
start
feigning
academic
apathy
themselves
.
And
so
the
cycle
continues
.
There
is
,
however
,
a
hidden
third
option
.
The
only
way
for
us
to
actually
feel
good
enough
without
being
cocky
is
to
start
being
honest
with
each
other
.
None
of
us
can
get
by
without
working
at
all
,
so
we
might
as
well
stop
pretending
like
we
can
.
Even
the
people
you
think
are
perfect
and
brilliant
have
incredibly
complex
lives
and
are
all
struggling
through
their
academic
pursuits
in
their
own
ways
.
What
if
they
chose
not
to
hide
those
struggles
?
And
because
for
someone
,
are
that
perfect
person
what
if
you
didn’t
hide
your
own
?
As
much
as
we
fear
it
,
vulnerability
is
rarely
considered
weakness
.
The
people
I
admire
most
are
those
who
are
unabashedly
themselves
,
who
don’t
feel
the
need
to
pretend
or
conform
.
In
fact
,
their
shameless
sincerity
makes
me
feel
better
about
myself
.
And
because
I
,
too
,
ultimately
want
to
make
other
people
happy
,
I
can
choose
to
sacrifice
the
illusion
of
perfection
I’ve
created
to
help
others
break
down
their
own
walls
.
If
we
all
tried
to
cultivate
a
candid
academic
culture
,
maybe
this
school
would
feel
a
little
less
cutthroat
.
But
in
all
seriousness
,
if
one
more
person
tells
me
they
haven’t
studied
at
all
for
the
exam
I’m
about
to
take
,
I’m
going
to
lose
it
.
Every
morning
,
as
I
rush
out
for
my
8
30
class
,
I’m
greeted
by
Tim
and
Martha
,
the
housekeepers
for
my
dorm
.
Every
morning
,
those
hello
s
and
how
are
you
s
jumpstart
my
day
and
I’m
consoled
by
the
comforting
smile
of
a
familiar
face
.
In
September
of
2018
,
The
Chronicle
published
an
article
discussing
changes
to
the
hours
of
housekeeping
staff
.
When
I
say
I
see
Tim
and
Martha
every
morning
,
I
mean
every
morning
.
They
now
work
seven
consecutive
days
every
other
week
.
Consequently
,
a
student
petition
,
which
has
now
gained
over
1
,
000
signatures
,
was
issued
,
calling
for
the
housekeepers
to
return
to
their
previous
Monday
Friday
schedule
.
Nevertheless
,
Duke’s
attention
has
been
drawn
elsewhere
,
and
our
housekeeping
staff
are
still
suffering
under
the
consequences
of
such
an
ineffective
schedule
change
.
From
taking
out
the
rotten
fruit
that
stayed
in
a
dormitory
fridge
too
long
,
to
cleaning
up
old
coffee
,
to
getting
out
the
smell
of
last
night’s
puke
,
the
employees
work
exceptionally
hard
to
maintain
cleanly
spaces
for
us
to
live
in
.
And
yet
,
the
ramifications
of
the
past
six
months
have
fallen
through
the
cracks
in
our
institutional
memory
.
I
hope
that
Duke
students
care
enough
to
continue
to
be
frustrated
at
the
injustice
done
against
the
employees
that
look
after
them
,
who
should
be
watching
their
kids
,
spending
time
with
their
families
,
and
going
to
church
rather
than
taking
out
the
trash
on
a
Sunday
.
I
hope
we
continue
to
fight
for
an
institutionalization
of
programs
that
promote
appreciation
,
community
,
and
discussion
among
students
,
administration
and
employees
.
Undeniably
,
HRL’s
persistence
in
implementing
the
new
schedule
,
despite
the
harm
it
has
inflicted
on
staff
,
exposes
the
institution’s
contemptuous
treatment
of
its
employees
.
President
Price
,
I
urge
you
to
hold
HRL
accountable
for
working
towards
an
effective
,
appropriate
schedule
.
If
you
speak
to
any
student
,
it
is
apparent
how
the
new
schedule
has
resulted
in
no
liveable
improvements
for
us
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
you
speak
to
any
housekeeping
staff
,
it
is
apparent
how
the
new
schedule
has
hurt
their
lives
.
Housekeeping
staff
make
students
feel
part
of
the
Duke
community
,
and
it
is
time
to
treat
them
like
they’re
a
part
of
it
too
.
The
initiative
will
work
nbsp
;
to
enroll
and
graduate
50
,
000
additional
lower
income
,
talented
students
by
2025
.
Give
them
their
roses
while
they
can
still
smell
them
.
This
phrase
has
been
on
my
mind
a
lot
this
semester
and
I
am
only
now
starting
to
realize
why
.
It’s
almost
as
if
the
universe
was
sending
me
a
sign
that
read
,
in
big
bold
letters
,
.
That’s
how
much
time
remains
between
now
and
the
end
of
the
semester
,
and
when
those
46
days
become
zero
the
Class
of
2019
can
officially
say
they
are
done
being
Duke
students
.
I
don’t
want
this
reality
to
shock
or
startle
whoever
actually
reads
my
columns
.
I
want
it
to
ground
both
seniors
and
underclassmen
alike
in
the
fact
that
time
is
running
short
,
and
that
Duke
is
not
forever
.
The
finiteness
of
your
time
as
students
hit
me
this
past
Sunday
night
.
As
I
sat
in
my
common
room
trying
my
best
to
hold
my
own
in
a
game
of
Trivial
Pursuit
,
I
realized
that
the
people
around
me
most
of
whom
were
seniors
were
responsible
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
my
fondest
Duke
experiences
.
The
games
of
frisbee
on
the
beach
during
Beach
Week
;
the
sprints
from
student
campaign
meetings
in
the
pouring
rain
;
the
hours
long
Super
Smash
Bros
tournaments
.
The
Class
of
2019
has
been
there
for
it
all
.
Mindless
fun
and
undying
laughter
aren’t
all
I
have
gotten
from
the
Class
of
2019
.
On
top
of
those
things
,
I
have
gotten
some
of
the
best
examples
of
how
to
live
life
both
as
a
Duke
student
and
as
a
confused
young
adult
.
The
moment
I
stepped
on
campus
I
was
greeted
by
a
short
,
lively
girl
who
now
refers
to
everyone
she
meets
as
a
nugget
.
’
During
the
hectic
scramble
that
is
first
year
rush
,
I
shared
moments
of
calm
with
one
of
the
best
student
news
reporters
I’ll
ever
meet
.
Even
now
when
West
campus
gets
a
little
too
stuffy
,
I
let
my
hair
down
and
lift
my
teacup
up
with
the
coolest
frisbee
player
I
know
.
These
people
and
so
many
more
have
been
integral
to
my
Duke
experience
.
I
wish
I
could
,
at
the
end
of
my
time
here
at
Duke
,
say
that
I
made
it
through
on
my
own
.
That
I
was
a
trailblazer
who
made
his
own
way
and
survived
Duke
with
no
help
.
I
learned
pretty
early
on
freshman
year
that
individualism
doesn’t
get
you
very
far
on
this
campus
.
There’s
no
way
anyone
can
make
it
four
years
without
some
sort
of
guidance
and
mentorship
.
So
,
forgive
me
,
seniors
,
when
I
grill
you
about
your
nontraditional
career
choices
.
I
promise
it
doesn’t
come
from
a
place
of
malice
,
but
fascination
.
I
want
to
know
what
drove
you
to
Teach
for
America
or
singing
in
Nashville
or
wanting
to
be
the
graphic
designer
for
Cory
Booker’s
campaign
.
I
want
to
know
if
that’s
something
I
see
myself
doing
.
Most
of
all
,
I
want
to
know
what
you
did
in
your
four
years
here
that
makes
you
the
GOAT
.
Now
that
your
four
years
are
almost
up
,
I
hope
you
take
time
to
revel
at
this
moment
.
It
is
the
second
half
of
second
semester
senior
year
.
I
can’t
pretend
to
have
the
authority
to
tell
you
all
what
to
do
with
your
remaining
,
fleeting
time
as
students
.
Not
only
am
I
not
up
to
date
on
senior
year
traditions
,
but
Duke
has
meant
something
different
for
each
one
of
you
.
Whatever
that
meaning
is
,
I
hope
these
last
few
weeks
remind
you
why
you
chose
Duke
nearly
four
years
ago
.
I
hope
you
spend
time
in
social
settings
that
remind
that
you
were
and
always
will
be
a
valuable
member
of
the
Duke
community
.
I
hope
you
eat
your
favorite
campus
meal
,
visit
your
favorite
professors
,
try
something
new
,
and
tick
off
every
graduation
requirement
if
that’s
your
thing
.
Most
of
all
,
I
hope
you
take
the
time
to
indulge
people
like
me
.
People
who
can’t
imagine
this
campus
without
you
on
it
.
People
who
are
sad
to
see
you
go
but
are
so
excited
about
the
future
you’ve
built
for
yourselves
.
People
who
want
to
tell
you
one
last
time
about
the
enormous
impact
you
have
made
on
their
lives
.
People
who
want
to
give
you
your
Duke
Gardens
roses
while
you
can
still
smell
them
.
After
reading
two
fellow
columnists’
articles
concerning
affiliation
at
Duke
,
I
was
disheartened
.
One
columnist
detailed
his
disappointment
with
his
social
experiences
as
an
independent
,
and
one
columnist
justified
the
exclusive
nature
of
Greek
life
with
the
assertion
of
the
exclusivity
of
life
in
general
.
While
exclusivity
and
hierarchy
are
realities
,
there
is
no
reason
that
Duke’s
social
climate
need
look
like
the
rest
of
the
world
.
In
fact
,
I
believe
we
as
a
student
body
,
especially
independents
,
have
the
power
to
make
Duke’s
campus
an
inclusive
and
welcoming
place
,
even
building
it
to
be
a
microcosm
of
what
we
want
our
world
to
look
like
.
This
utopic
world
could
be
filled
with
diverse
communities
that
aim
to
uplift
one
another
,
learn
from
one
another
,
and
come
together
during
hardship
.
Fortunately
,
there
are
individuals
at
Duke
who
are
working
to
build
non
exclusive
,
non
hierarchical
communities
.
Their
actions
both
go
against
the
grain
of
Duke’s
social
life
and
nbsp
;
reflect
the
kind
of
student
life
that’s
advertised
at
Duke
.
I
spoke
with
Grant
Besner
Trinity
19’
,
Ryan
Bergamini
Pratt
,
’19
,
Matt
Wisner
Trinity
’20
,
and
Mary
Stuart
Elder
Pratt
19
.
I
asked
Matt
and
Grant
about
their
opinions
on
Duke’s
social
climate
.
Both
attested
to
the
vibrancy
and
strong
sense
of
community
from
the
first
year
experience
in
contrast
to
the
exclusivity
and
even
tribalism
,
as
Grant
said
,
of
the
ensuing
years
.
Matt
stated
that
random
assignment
to
dorms
and
now
,
roommates
too
during
freshman
year
created
,
in
my
experience
,
a
social
situation
that
was
different
from
the
rest
of
my
time
at
Duke
one
that
allowed
me
to
organically
meet
people
and
grow
closer
based
on
compatibility
and
shared
interests
rather
than
willingness
to
join
some
kind
of
social
organization
.
Ideally
,
this
strong
sense
of
community
would
continue
to
grow
as
students
leave
the
gates
of
East
Campus
.
On
the
contrary
,
it
seems
to
dissipate
as
students
funnel
into
selective
housing
and
independents
are
plopped
relatively
randomly
in
West
Campus
dorms
.
Most
residents
in
West
Campus
dorms
barely
know
their
own
neighbors
and
dorms
serve
solely
as
a
place
to
sleep
rather
than
a
vibrant
community
.
As
Grant
noted
,
Students
indenting
socially
more
with
their
first
year
dorm
then
by
their
West
Campus
housing
.
.
.
and
if
that
isn’t
indicative
of
the
problem
,
then
I
don’t
know
what
is
.
I
understand
people’s
preference
for
selective
housing
.
Living
surrounded
by
people
in
one’s
fraternity
,
sorority
,
or
SLG
can
serve
as
a
social
safe
haven
.
Accordingly
,
more
than
advocating
for
the
end
of
selective
housing
,
we
as
independents
need
to
build
the
kinds
of
communities
we
would
like
to
see
.
Given
the
isolation
that
many
independent
West
Campus
residents
experience
,
the
role
of
the
RA
is
critical
.
Matt
,
Mary
Stuart
,
and
Ryan
are
all
RAs
.
Matt
reflected
on
his
motivation
to
enhance
the
independent
experience
.
It
became
kind
of
an
obsession
of
mine
to
almost
prove
that
community
could
be
built
between
a
group
of
thirty
people
who
had
never
met
each
other
before
to
show
that
Duke
students
don’t
have
to
rely
on
some
formalized
membership
to
a
social
organization
to
find
a
healthy
and
fulfilling
social
situation
,
he
said
.
Building
on
this
point
,
Mary
Stuart
reflected
on
RAs’
role
in
building
community
.
Specifically
in
independent
groups
,
you
have
the
meshing
together
of
all
sorts
of
communities
athletics
,
SLGs
,
service
organizations
,
Greek
life
,
and
more
.
But
you
also
have
students
without
defined
communities
.
RAs
have
the
responsibility
of
bringing
all
of
these
communities
together
in
some
way
.
Matt
,
Mary
Stuart
,
Ryan
,
and
many
other
RAs
show
us
that
the
role
is
more
than
that
of
one
of
a
supervisor
,
they
also
serve
to
encourage
community
in
places
lacking
of
any
sort
of
social
cohesion
.
Similar
to
Grant
and
Matt
,
Ryan
saw
flaws
in
Duke’s
current
social
scene
that
incentivizes
students
to
seek
refuge
in
exclusive
groups
.
When
I
first
met
Ryan
,
I
was
struck
by
his
passion
for
building
community
.
He
can
be
spotted
every
Sunday
evening
sitting
in
the
Skillet
amidst
animated
conversation
with
a
different
amalgam
of
people
each
week
.
This
is
what
he
calls
The
DSG
Duke
Student
Group
,
a
play
on
Duke
Student
Government
Sunday
Night
Dinner
.
Sunday
Night
Dinner
is
a
consistent
time
each
week
where
Duke
students
can
meet
each
other
over
food
.
According
to
Ryan
,
If
you
want
to
be
part
of
any
community
,
it
takes
buy
in
.
And
the
only
buy
in
that
DSG
needs
is
for
you
to
show
up
.
Ryan
encourages
all
walks
of
life
on
Duke’s
campus
to
join
and
even
posts
the
open
invitation
in
the
All
Duke
Facebook
group
.
Ryan
is
also
heading
the
CommunYT
efforts
,
which
you
may
have
seen
on
Instagram
or
around
campus
.
The
communYT
was
an
initiative
to
encourage
people
to
think
about
how
they
can
bring
the
change
they
want
to
the
campus
.
According
to
Ryan
,
the
Young
Trustee
the
YT
aspect
of
CommunYT
alone
cannot
create
a
greater
community
.
Rather
,
it
takes
all
of
us
to
buy
in
the
crate
the
greater
Duke
community
that
everyone
says
they
want
.
I
also
asked
Grant
about
his
efforts
to
build
community
.
Grant’s
efforts
centered
on
K
Ville
and
Duke
Conversations
.
He
started
the
K
Ville
Common
Room
due
to
his
realization
that
nbsp
;
K
Ville
is
the
one
place
on
campus
where
affiliation
,
year
,
gender
,
race
and
other
identity
factors
seem
to
fade
away
.
By
providing
a
physical
space
in
K
Ville
to
facilitate
spontaneous
interaction
,
he
believed
that
he
could
do
his
part
to
build
a
stronger
campus
community
.
Grant
also
reflected
on
his
efforts
with
Duke
Conversations
,
of
which
he
was
president
his
junior
year
.
Duke
Conversations
enables
students
and
professors
to
eat
dinner
and
provides
a
great
model
for
students
to
meet
and
engage
in
meaningful
and
sometimes
vulnerable
discussions
.
This
type
of
interaction
fosters
student
interactions
and
engagement
with
people
outside
of
their
immediate
social
circles
.
I’m
a
big
proponent
of
the
belief
that
community
is
a
collective
,
inclusive
institution
rather
than
inherently
exclusionary
,
Grant
said
.
When
we
view
everyone
as
being
part
of
an
'in
group
,
'
we
open
ourselves
up
to
experience
more
of
what
Duke
and
life
has
to
offer
.

While
the
efforts
by
these
Duke
students
are
notable
,
I
know
there
are
many
other
people
on
campus
striving
to
build
communities
in
unconventional
ways
.
Nonetheless
,
building
community
can
start
small
,
with
actions
as
simple
as
getting
lunch
with
classmates
,
texting
that
old
first
year
groupchat
,
and
being
friendly
to
people
you
barely
know
.
The
root
of
the
idea
is
to
break
down
the
exclusive
,
hierarchical
social
barriers
,
to
learn
from
those
different
from
ourselves
,
and
to
grow
collectively
as
a
community
.
The
longer
we
exist
within
homogenous
circles
,
the
longer
we
thwart
our
own
personal
and
communal
growth
.
Mi
Gente
is
proud
to
endorse
Daisy
Almonte
for
DSG
president
.
Daisy’s
passion
and
commitment
to
make
Duke
and
DSG
more
accessible
and
transparent
to
the
entire
student
body
is
compatible
with
our
mission
as
Duke’s
Latinx
student
association
to
promote
awareness
about
Latinx
cultural
,
political
,
educational
,
and
social
issues
.
However
,
her
platform
not
only
amplifies
our
mission
,
but
also
strives
to
elevate
that
of
the
whole
student
body
.
Her
leadership
is
grounded
in
the
communities
around
her
,
and
we
believe
she
has
the
most
experience
to
take
on
the
role
of
DSG
President
.
Her
work
and
activism
across
campus
has
proven
Daisy
to
be
for
the
people
and
about
the
people
.
Through
her
progress
on
the
hate
and
bias
policy
that
she
spearheaded
this
year
alongside
her
committee
and
work
with
Title
IX
and
the
sexual
misconduct
task
force
,
she
has
shown
that
she
has
experience
interacting
with
high
level
administration
while
advocating
for
the
student
body
.
Daisy
pushes
to
obtain
accountability
,
action
,
and
results
from
high
level
administrators
,
university
stakeholders
and
faculty
.
Above
all
,
she
uplifts
the
voices
that
are
present
and
have
been
present
for
years
but
have
not
been
included
.
Daisy
is
finally
bringing
these
inequities
to
the
forefront
and
it
goes
to
show
the
importance
of
having
these
difficult
discussions
that
require
the
input
of
so
many
different
communities
.
She
is
an
agent
of
change
who
has
become
a
pioneer
for
the
Latinx
community
on
campus
and
is
paving
the
way
for
others
in
the
future
.
We
believe
in
Daisy
Almonte
,
and
we
hope
you
will
too
.
Remember

Mi
Gente
Co
Presidents
on
behalf
of
Mi
Gente’s
2018
2019
Executive
Council
On
March
15
,
a
white
supremacist
carried
out
a
massacre
across
two
mosques
in
New
Zealand
,
leaving
50
dead
and
many
more
wounded
.
The
gunman
was
met
with
Hello
brother
,
as
he
entered
the
door
of
a
Christchurch
mosque
before
opening
fire
on
worshippers
inside
,
stripping
them
of
their
humanity
.
For
Muslims
across
the
globe
,
Friday
prayers
at
local
mosques
offer
a
sanctuary
for
practicing
their
faith
among
a
loving
community
.
A
faith
that
western
media
outlets
,
American
political
leaders
and
even
those
within
our
own
Duke
community
scrutinize
,
misrepresent
and
attack
.
New
Zealand’s
prime
minister
,
Jacinda
Ardern
,
called
the
attack
an
extraordinary
and
unprecedented
act
of
violence
that
added
to
a
growing
list
of
mass
murders
stemming
from
white
nationalism
.
This
organized
,
premeditated
slaughter
of
innocent
individuals
in
their
place
of
worship
is
only
the
latest
manifestation
of
white
supremacy
ideologies
making
headlines
.
Last
Friday
afternoon
,
the
fascist
terrorist
was
delusionally
intent
on
fighting
so
called
white
genocide
by
targeting
a
population
he
saw
as
a
threat
.
Muslims
being
viewed
as
a
violent
invasive
community
is
the
result
of
decades
long
large
scale
campaigns
of
vilification
targeting
both
the
faith
and
its
people
by
some
of
the
most
powerful
international
actors
including
American
political
leaders
like
President
Trump
.
From
college
campuses
to
the
national
political
stage
,
when
marginalized
communities
push
back
against
white
supremacist
rhetoric
,
they’re
often
met
with
cries
for
free
speech
and
the
insistence
that
anti
immigrant
sentiments
are
nothing
more
than
opinions
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas
.
However
,
the
past
few
years
especially
have
been
ample
evidence
for
the
magnitude
of
ramifications
these
right
wing
ideologies
have
.
The
consequences
of
tolerating
white
nationalism
has
included
the
murders
of
fifty
Muslims
in
a
New
Zealand
mosque
,
nine
Black
worshippers
in
a
Charleston
Church
,
six
Sikhs
in
Wisconsin
,
a
woman
in
Charlottesville
,
and
eleven
Jews
in
a
Pittsburgh
synagogue
.
To
separate
the
racist
,
xenophobic
and
sexist
ideals
at
the
foundation
of
white
supremacy
from
white
supremacy's
role
in
the
murder
of
millions
through
the
centuries
is
nothing
less
than
inexcusably
disrespectful
to
the
countless
victims
.
The
normalization
of
white
nationalism
and
white
supremacy
we
are
witnessing
unfold
before
us
must
be
taken
as
a
serious
,
existential
threat
to
humanity
.
It
is
our
obligation
to
call
out
politicians
,
media
outlets
and
institutions
that
under
the
guise
of
free
speech
give
it
a
platform
.
In
addition
,
we
must
call
out
the
hypocrisy
that
has
given
white
supremacy
a
pass
in
our
societies
.
It
is
an
egregious
and
vile
discrepancy
that
racial
justice
organizations
like
Black
Lives
Matter
have
been
dubbed
by
the
FBI
as
Black
Identity
Extremists
while
growing
white
supremacist
groups
aren’t
classified
as
dangerous
.
The
federal
government’s
categorization
of
minorities
fighting
for
basic
civil
rights
as
extremism
speaks
to
how
deeply
white
supremacy
is
embedded
into
our
institutional
systems
.
The
reality
is
that
white
supremacists
aren’t
as
far
removed
from
us
as
we’d
like
to
believe
.
The
individuals
that
attended
that
mosque
were
stripped
of
their
futures
and
ripped
from
their
families
;
these
tragedies
will
continue
to
happen
unless
we
confront
the
ideological
roots
wherever
they
are
.
Thoughts
and
prayers
are
no
longer
enough
.
We
have
the
right
to
feel
grief
and
heartbreak
,
but
we
also
have
a
moral
obligation
to
defeat
white
supremacy
.
The
proposed
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
would
have
stops
near
Duke
University
Medical
Center
and
on
Ninth
Street
.
Last
Wednesday
,
Duke
notified
GoTriangle
that
it
refused
to
sign
on
to
one
of
Durham’s
largest
ever
mass
transit
infrastructure
projects
,
the
Durham
Orange
light
rail
.
Citing
patient
safety
and
research
concerns
due
to
potential
construction
vibrations
,
electromagnetic
interference
,
power
and
utility
disruptions
,
and
the
high
cost
of
liability
insurance
,
Duke
declined
to
sign
a
cooperative
agreement
necessary
to
secure
a
land
donation
from
the
University
.
The
agreement
would
also
bind
the
University
to
further
negotiations
in
order
to
make
the
project
eligible
for
federal
and
state
funding
.
The
announcement
immediately
sparked
community
outrage
North
Carolina
Congressional
representatives
,
city
council
members
,
county
commissioners
,
and
groups
like
the
Coalition
for
Affordable
Housing
and
Transit
condemned
Duke
for
turning
its
back
on
the
community
.
Duke’s
decision
not
to
support
the
light
rail
jeopardizes
a
decades
in
the
making
,
2
billion
project
designed
to
create
equitable
mass
transit
and
affordable
housing
.
Community
members
have
reason
to
be
upset
.
Despite
Duke’s
claims
that
it
has
long
maintained
concerns
regarding
the
light
rail
,
a
report
from
GoTriangle
released
Feb
.
26
detailed
years
of
meeting
notes
with
Duke
officials
revealing
the
University’s
baffling
inconsistency
.
For
example
,
as
described
in
a
thorough
article
from
Indy
Week
,
Executive
Vice
President
Tallman
Trask
specifically
asked
for
a
light
rail
station
near
the
hospital
and
for
elevated
tracks
.
Now
,
however
,
both
of
Trask’s
requests
are
among
Duke’s
stated
reasons
for
pulling
out
of
the
project
.
From
elevated
tracks
to
tree
protection
and
last
minute
public
announcements
of
Duke’s
concerns
,
it
appears
that
Duke
has
only
been
consistent
in
its
lack
of
transparency
.
At
best
,
Duke
acted
incompetently
,
and
at
worst
,
dishonestly
.
If
it’s
the
latter
,
Duke
has
abused
its
influence
and
power
by
stringing
the
community
along
and
failing
to
attempt
to
resolve
its
concerns
or
to
withdraw
from
the
project
before
GoTriangle
,
the
city
and
the
county
spent
130
million
in
taxpayer
funds
.
While
Duke’s
withdrawal
from
the
light
rail
project
is
startling
,
it’s
not
unprecedented
.
As
city
councilmember
Charlie
Reece
wrote
on
Twitter
,
Duke’s
decision
to
kill
the
light
rail
project
sadly
reinforces
the
worst
fears
of
many
Durham
residents
that
Duke
University
is
an
arrogant
and
elitist
enclave
with
little
interest
in
being
the
kind
of
partner
this
city
needs
.
He
touches
on
a
crucial
point
.
The
light
rail
fiasco
is
nothing
new
,
but
rather
the
latest
example
in
Duke’s
long
record
of
prioritizing
its
self
interest
at
the
expense
of
the
community
,
and
leaving
Durham
residents
to
bear
the
consequences
of
the
University’s
poor
decisions
.
For
instance
in
the
1960s
,
the
city
of
Durham
embarked
on
the
construction
of
the
East
West
Freeway
popularly
known
as
the
Durham
Freeway
which
destroyed
the
historically
black
Hayti
community
.
In
a
later
phase
of
the
project
,
Duke
president
Terry
Sanford
played
a
significant
role
negotiating
with
the
city
to
leave
university
property
Duke
Gardens
and
Erwin
Mills
properties
untouched
by
the
new
highway
.
By
the
late
1970s
,
the
highway’s
path
wound
north
from
Hayti
in
order
to
connect
to
15
501
.
The
project
threatened
to
cut
in
half
another
African
American
community
at
Crest
Street
,
just
off
Duke’s
campus
.
The
Crest
Street
neighborhood
had
long
ties
to
the
university
its
earliest
residents
helped
build
Duke
and
many
in
the
late
70s
still
worked
at
The
Plantation
.
nbsp
;
Duke
,
however
,
stayed
silent
on
the
potential
destruction
of
Crest
Street
at
least
publicly
.
The
University
asserted
it
did
not
have
influence
to
affect
the
route
with
Durham’s
elected
officials
although
it
had
already
manipulated
the
freeway
project
to
the
university’s
benefit
in
preserving
the
Gardens
and
other
University
property
.
Privately
,
Duke
exerted
its
influence
.
In
letters
to
Durham’s
mayor
and
the
state
Board
of
Transportation
,
President
Sanford
shared
his
unequivocal
support
for
the
East
West
Freeway’s
proposed
route
through
Crest
Street
,
likely
because
the
freeway
would
ease
access
to
hospital
parking
.
At
the
same
time
,
Duke
told
Crest
Street
representatives
that
it
wouldn’t
support
any
project
that
destroyed
the
neighborhood
.
President
Sanford
and
the
University
were
blatantly
deceptive
,
demonstrating
little
regard
for
Crest
Street’s
fate
when
it
conflicted
with
the
school’s
interests
.
A
few
years
later
,
Crest
Street
would
be
saved
by
persistent
community
activists
despite
total
lack
of
support
from
its
closest
neighbor
and
one
of
the
most
powerful
institutions
in
Durham
Duke
University
.
Crest
Street
is
only
one
example
of
where
the
University
has
failed
in
its
responsibility
to
its
community
.
Beyond
major
infrastructure
projects
,
Duke
has
repeatedly
mistreated
and
exploited
its
low
wage
employees
who
largely
came
from
neighborhoods
like
Crest
Street
and
Walltown
,
just
off
East
Campus
.
From
1974
to
1978
,
hospital
workers
led
by
the
legendary
Oliver
Harvey
attempted
to
unionize
in
two
separate
efforts
.
Although
these
workers
simply
asserted
their
fundamental
rights
to
collectively
bargain
,
attain
living
wages
and
improve
workplace
conditions
,
Duke
responded
aggressively
.
The
University
fired
and
intimidated
workers
accused
of
union
sympathies
and
paid
500
a
day
to
hire
anti
union
consultants
.
Duke
won
while
workers
suffered
by
1978
,
it
had
stifled
the
major
hospital
unionization
drives
and
ensured
the
University
would
treat
workers
as
it
saw
fit
.
While
it
would
be
unfair
to
characterize
all
of
Duke’s
actions
as
wholly
detrimental
to
Durham
,
it
is
clear
that
Durham
only
benefits
as
a
byproduct
of
Duke
first
fulfilling
its
own
interests
.
The
present
day
light
rail
project
fits
neatly
into
a
larger
historical
pattern
,
from
Crest
Street
to
hospital
unionization
to
present
day
real
estate
acquisitions
driving
displacement
and
gentrification
.
President
Price’s
recent
announcement
that
he
is
greatly
pained
by
those
questioning
Duke’s
commitment
to
Durham
demonstrates
that
he
and
the
University
at
large
still
fail
to
fully
understand
its
history
or
think
beyond
its
own
narrow
priorities
.
During
the
negotiations
,
Tallman
Trask
even
suggested
the
light
rail
route
should
go
through
the
Crest
Street
community
instead
of
along
Erwin
Road
,
oblivious
to
any
sense
of
historical
irony
.
It’s
possible
the
University
withdrew
from
the
light
rail
project
for
substantive
and
legitimate
reasons
.
However
,
last
week
made
clear
that
the
University
has
not
fully
figured
out
how
to
engage
fairly
and
productively
with
Durham
.
Duke
officials
are
accustomed
to
acting
with
impunity
senior
administrative
officials
can
fire
workers
for
playing
rap
songs
or
allegedly
hit
parking
attendants
with
their
car
without
consequence
.
This
,
however
,
must
end
.
Duke
must
be
held
accountable
for
.
The
success
or
failure
of
this
project
goes
beyond
vibrations
or
the
back
and
forth
between
GoTriangle
and
Duke
;
this
project
impacts
Durham’s
development
for
decades
to
come
and
the
ever
evolving
relationship
between
Duke
and
Durham
.
In
the
words
of
city
councilmember
Mark
Anthony
Middleton
,
Duke
should
not
,
however
,
determine
our
future
.
If
light
rail
dies
,
it
won’t
be
because
Duke
killed
it
.
It
will
be
because
Duke
was
allowed
to
kill
it
.
Ultimately
,
we
can’t
rely
on
Duke
administration
,
or
GoTriangle
,
or
our
local
governments
.
We
students
,
workers
,
professors
,
community
members
must
assert
our
stake
in
building
a
better
Durham
and
Duke
.
So
,
here’s
my
ask
to
President
Price
and
Executive
Vice
President
Trask
there
are
two
ways
you
can
take
seriously
this
history
and
the
community’s
outrage
.
Reverse
yesterday’s
decision
and
agree
to
the
mediated
negotiations
offered
by
GoTriangle
on
March
4th
and
find
a
solution
.
Agree
to
take
part
in
an
open
community
forum
take
the
democratic
step
and
show
us
you
genuinely
care
about
the
future
of
Duke
and
Durham
.
In
the
fall
of
my
junior
year
,
I
found
my
legs
dangling
from
the
exam
table
of
a
doctor’s
office
explaining
symptoms
of
nausea
that
wouldn’t
go
away
.
Stress
and
anxiety
had
caused
my
appetite
to
disappear
I’d
sit
down
for
a
meal
and
not
be
able
to
eat
.
I
wasn’t
hungry
for
my
favorite
hamburger
and
milkshake
combo
I’d
enjoyed
weekly
for
years
.
Looking
for
something
,
anything
,
which
would
make
it
better
,
the
doctor
offered
the
following
suggestion
This
was
not
the
diagnosis
I
wanted
.
In
fact
,
this
felt
like
the
least
helpful
suggestion
I’d
ever
heard
.
But
his
white
coat
and
stethoscope
meant
business
.
For
me
to
start
feeling
back
to
normal
,
I
needed
to
focus
on
breathing
,
through
mindfulness
and
meditation
.
I
needed
to
let
go
of
stress
in
order
for
the
nausea
to
subside
.
This
proved
to
be
no
easy
task
.
In
college
,
there
is
no
shortage
of
moments
which
make
it
hard
to
breathe
.
I’m
sure
you’ve
felt
it
,
too
when
the
exam
booklet
gets
passed
to
you
from
the
end
of
the
row
,
when
your
crush
gets
on
the
C1
and
you
wait
for
them
to
look
up
and
lock
eyes
with
you
,
the
seconds
before
the
final
buzzer
in
Cameron
when
it’s
tied
and
the
other
team
is
about
to
shoot
a
free
throw
.
These
anxieties
make
your
heart
rate
zig
and
zag
and
momentarily
you
can’t
breathe
out
of
fear
that
the
next
inhale
will
hurt
more
than
the
sinking
pit
in
your
stomach
.
Feeling
like
you
can’t
breathe
from
stress
,
or
anxiety
,
or
illness
is
isolating
and
terrifying
,
all
at
once
.
The
feeling
is
so
prevalent
among
college
students
that
we
are
trained
in
techniques
to
make
it
go
away
Koru
mindfulness
classes
,
guided
meditations
,
and
yoga
are
just
some
of
the
resources
offered
to
Duke
students
at
the
Student
Wellness
Center

Maybe
we
are
only
allowed
a
finite
number
of
moments
that
take
our
breath
away
.
William
Faulkner
put
it
this
way
There
were
three
things
and
no
more
breathing
,
pleasure
,
darkness
.
The
rhythm
of
our
breath
is
the
rhythm
of
our
life
in
and
out
,
in
and
out
,
in
and
out
.
I’ve
come
to
learn
that
people
often
ask
Have
you
taken
a
deep
breath
?
when
they
mean
to
say
I
love
you
.
But
I’ve
also
learned
that
when
everything
feels
like
it
is
falling
apart
,
a
few
deep
breaths
can’t
put
your
life
back
together
.
The
road
to
me
feeling
better
was
paved
with
mindfulness
exercises
,
but
it
also
took
the
work
of
changing
some
habits
,
meeting
with
a
nutritionist
and
counselor
,
and
unwavering
love
from
friends
and
family
.
Senior
year
,
I’m
trying
to
keep
things
very
simple
inhale
,
exhale
,
right
foot
,
left
foot
.
Graduation
looms
around
the
corner
and
the
cliff
that
the
Class
of
2019
stands
on
easily
makes
breathing
feel
impossible
.
But
as
we
stand
up
in
unison
to
toss
our
caps
into
the
air
,
perhaps
I’ll
experience
that
feeling
of
awe
that
will
take
my
breath
away
.
The
opposite
of
anxiety
and
fear
and
loneliness
,
and
instead
one
collective
exhale
.
Except
this
is
one
I’ve
held
in
for
four
years
,
and
then
,
finally
,
out
.
Devil’s
Krafthouse
,
the
first
vendor
of
the
renovated
West
Union
,
opened
at
the
end
of
February
on
the
first
floor
of
West
Union
.
Hey
,
how
are
you
?
Good
,
how
are
you
?
Good
,
thanks
.
How
frequently
do
you
have
this
conversation
each
day
?
I’m
guessing
at
least
a
dozen
times
.
But
,
how
many
of
those
times
do
you
say
how
you
really
are
?
I’m
guessing
not
too
often
.
Amidst
the
craziness
of
classes
,
clubs
,
meetings
,
and
recruiting
,
we
become
so
focused
on
just
getting
from
A
to
B
in
time
and
completing
the
items
on
our
daily
to
do
list
.
As
a
result
,
we
don’t
often
get
the
opportunity
to
think
about
how
we’re
feeling
and
why
.
Even
less
often
do
we
share
this
with
the
people
around
us
.
Think
back
to
Orientation
Week
before
freshman
year
.
You
probably
remember
some
of
the
people
you
met
,
getting
your
first
taste
of
being
a
Blue
Devil
,
and
being
exhausted
by
the
seemingly
endless
sessions
.
One
of
these
was
called
True
Blue
,
during
which
you
saw
a
fellow
classmate
demonstrate
that
he
or
she
had
no
idea
the
size
of
a
standard
drink
and
watched
students
act
out
various
situations
you
might
encounter
throughout
your
Duke
experience
.
While
it
may
have
easily
been
overlooked
at
the
time
,
this
session
taught
a
critical
lesson
it’s
okay
to
sometimes
not
be
okay
;
the
people
around
you
are
also
struggling
,
but
you
can
work
through
challenges
together
.
I’m
guessing
all
of
us
are
familiar
with
the
concept
of
effortless
perfection
.
It’s
when
someone
you
know
seems
to
balance
taking
five
classes
,
being
a
leader
in
a
half
dozen
clubs
,
has
their
summer
plans
all
set
up
,
and
somehow
manages
to
go
out
each
weekend
.
It
seems
they
have
everything
together
.
But
,
once
you
dig
a
little
deeper
,
you’ll
realize
they
share
some
of
the
same
struggles
you
are
experiencing
.
So
many
students
are
overwhelmed
by
their
course
loads
,
stressed
out
by
their
extracurricular
commitments
,
uncertain
of
their
future
plans
,
and
dealing
with
issues
among
their
social
circles
.
Yet
,
when
we’re
asked
how
we
are
,
the
almost
certain
answer
remains
good
.
I’m
not
saying
I
don’t
fall
victim
to
this
;
I
do
.
But
,
whenever
I
break
out
of
this
routine
to
share
how
I
really
am
,
I’m
glad
that
I
did
.
When
I
express
that
I’m
dealing
with
the
passing
of
a
loved
one
,
people
have
consistently
expressed
their
condolences
and
support
.
When
I
say
that
I
rocked
my
last
admissions
tour
or
led
a
fantastic
conversation
about
religion
and
politics
,
people
are
proud
and
share
in
my
excitement
.
Offering
these
bits
of
information
can
help
strengthen
your
friendships
,
but
also
help
you
move
through
the
highs
and
lows
of
any
given
day
.
Being
authentic
can
be
one
of
our
greatest
strengths
.
I
believe
that
most
members
of
the
Duke
community
genuinely
care
about
one
another
.
But
,
how
can
we
really
be
there
for
one
another
if
we
don’t
know
who
could
really
use
some
support
and
encouragement
?
Your
closest
friends
may
already
know
what
you’re
celebrating
,
working
on
,
or
recovering
from
.
I
understand
some
of
these
things
are
personal
,
and
you
might
not
feel
comfortable
sharing
them
.
That’s
why
a
good
first
step
is
simply
being
honest
about
how
you
are
feeling
.
Maybe
the
person
you’re
talking
to
will
congratulate
you
on
your
achievement
,
console
you
in
your
challenges
,
or
ask
you
more
about
what’s
going
on
.
You
could
even
find
out
that
the
person
you’re
talking
to
is
experiencing
similar
highs
and
lows
.
These
interactions
are
healthy
and
necessary
,
but
also
relieving
.
You
can
be
honest
with
the
people
around
you
.
Even
more
importantly
,
you
can
really
support
your
fellow
Blue
Devils
by
taking
the
time
to
show
you
care
.
Andrew
Carlins
,
a
sophomore
,
launched
an
amazing
program
to
facilitate
students
supporting
one
another
.
In
September
,
Andrew
started
Kindness
Grams
,
packages
containing
a
handwritten
note
,
Kind
snack
bar
,
and
small
gift
.
Anyone
can
send
an
email
to
to
request
a
Kindness
Gram
for
a
friend
,
and
it
will
be
delivered
to
them
without
costing
the
sender
or
receiver
a
penny
.
Andrew
has
tabled
at
the
Bryan
Center
Plaza
with
the
Wellness
Center
asking
students
to
write
a
note
to
a
friend
which
will
be
part
of
a
Kindness
Gram
for
them
.
When
I
spoke
with
Andrew
about
Kindness
Grams
,
he
said
,
Kindness
and
authenticity
are
easily
relegated
to
the
bottom
of
priorities
at
Duke
,
in
light
of
evergrowing
mounds
of
work
and
other
commitments
.
Yet
,
at
the
same
time
,
they
are
things
that
make
us
human
.
When
I
asked
him
about
the
origin
of
Kindness
Grams
,
he
explained
they
stem
from
his
learning
and
working
with
Duke
Wellness
,
Duke
Authenticity
Project
,
Residential
Life
and
Peer
for
You
.
With
the
support
of
the
Wellness
Center
,
and
the
Kenan
Institute
,
we
have
been
able
to
turn
this
idea
into
a
reality
.
Together
we
hope
to
create
opportunities
for
meaningful
engagement
amid
the
stresses
that
come
with
being
a
Duke
student
,
Andrew
concluded
.
As
the
recipient
of
a
Kindness
Gram
myself
,
I
can
attest
to
the
warm
feeling
one
gets
from
knowing
a
friend
was
thinking
of
them
and
took
the
initiative
to
express
it
.
There
are
so
many
ways
to
brighten
someone’s
day
.
Say
hello
to
the
person
you
see
on
the
C1
who
you
haven’t
talked
to
since
freshman
year
,
ask
they
how
they
are
,
and
show
interest
in
the
answer
.
Text
a
friend
who
told
you
they
had
been
studying
hard
for
a
midterm
or
preparing
for
an
interview
,
and
ask
them
how
it
went
.
Even
smiling
as
strangers
walk
may
bring
them
joy
.
As
Duke
students
,
we
each
have
a
lot
on
our
plate
some
things
we
love
doing
,
some
not
so
much
.
Genuinely
supporting
those
around
us
and
being
ourselves
can
yield
so
many
benefits
.
I
think
we
would
all
do
well
to
renew
the
idea
of
being
true
and
being
you
as
conveyed
during
True
Blue
.
Dear
President
Price
,
As
59
Resident
Assistants
,
we
write
to
urge
that
residential
housekeeping
staff
return
to
their
original
schedules
.
From
our
perspective
,
marginally
cleaner
bathrooms
and
kitchens
over
the
weekend
have
not
improved
the
safety
and
wellbeing
of
residents
enough
to
merit
the
substantial
disruption
to
housekeeping
staff’s
lives
.
Housekeeping
staff
can
no
longer
connect
with
their
church
communities
nor
afford
the
childcare
now
necessary
due
to
this
schedule
.
Whereas
housekeeping
staff
cannot
adjust
to
these
permanently
harmful
impacts
,
residents
barely
notice
the
improved
condition
of
weekend
facilities
.
In
fact
,
some
residents
have
expressed
annoyance
and
surprise
that
housekeeping
staff
are
here
on
Sundays
.
As
RAs
,
we
are
committed
to
the
community
within
our
halls
;
this
goes
beyond
students
.
The
community
is
for
housekeeping
staff
as
well
.
For
these
reasons
,
we
hope
they
can
return
to
the
original
schedules
.
I
ask
because
since
September
of
last
year
,
Duke’s
residential
housekeeping
staff
have
been
required
to
work
weekends
.
On
March
6
,
I
attended
a
student
run
appreciation
lunch
for
residential
housekeepers
student
run
because
HRL
offered
no
such
gesture
.
The
event
ran
from
12
p
.
m
.
to
1
p
.
m
.
Those
housekeepers
present
had
to
leave
at
about
12
40
p
.
m
.
,
because
per
university
policy
they
must
clock
back
into
their
buildings
by
1
p
.
m
.
I
put
to
you
the
questions
I
left
with
.
I
have
kept
the
housekeepers
at
center
in
the
hope
that
someone
might
finally
hear
them
.
If
you
are
wondering
why
residential
housekeeping
staff
seem
not
to
speak
up
themselves
,
it
is
because
they
are
afraid
it
could
cost
them
their
jobs
.
What
good
is
a
closer
to
living
15
wage
,
if
the
work
that
earns
it
robs
the
earner
of
that
time
when
life
is
lived
?
The
Duke
Students
and
Workers
Alliance
fact
sheet
shows
that
workers
must
now
live
by
an
inane
schedule
of
seven
days
on
,
two
off
,
three
on
,
two
off
.
They
spend
every
other
weekend
working
.
One
worker
felt
estranged
from
their
family
,
having
lost
the
two
days
of
the
week
they
could
share
.
For
some
strange
reason
,
it
appears
that
few
other
area
employers
share
this
schedule
.
Another
would
have
days
out
with
their
family
.
These
days
,
not
so
much
.
You
said
in
Duke
Today
,
on
August
25
,
2017
,
that
Our
goal
is
always
for
Duke
to
be
the
best
place
to
work
in
North
Carolina
.
But
which
Duke
?
The
Duke
for
these
residential
housekeeping
staff
is
seven
days
of
work
,
upwards
of
60
hours
per
week
,
and
with
no
additional
compensation
.
Even
when
there
is
a
Sunday
rest
,
they
say
they
are
too
tired
to
enjoy
it
alone
or
with
anyone
else
.
Perhaps
one
might
counter
,
as
Leslye
Kornegay
,
director
of
university
environmental
services
did
,
that
changes
are
reviewed
with
local
union
representatives
for
the
unit
,
and
are
implemented
in
accordance
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
.
And
the
workers
are
not
working
more
hours
than
they
did
before
.
Yet
according
to
workers
,
the
University
with
friends
at
union
busting
law
firms
was
not
so
kind
.
One
voiced
their
complaints
,
only
to
be
told
to
fall
in
line
or
seek
work
elsewhere
.
Because
jobs
abound
outside
of
Duke
,
the
largest
private
employer
in
Durham
.
Another
can’t
remember
any
conversation
only
a
meeting
where
workers
were
told
the
same
take
it
or
leave
it
deal
.
They
work
the
same
hours
,
yes
,
but
in
exhausting
seven
day
sprints
and
odd
,
lonely
rests
.
They
have
the
same
quantity
of
pay
for
a
lower
quality
of
life
.
This
harm
to
the
body
is
bad
enough
.
But
your
silence
on
this
harm
does
harm
to
heart
and
soul
.
One
used
to
go
to
church
,
but
can’t
if
they’re
working
.
Another
used
to
be
involved
in
ministry
with
their
daughter
,
but
has
since
had
to
stop
.
The
daughter
has
also
been
cut
off
from
an
arts
program
.
More
have
been
cut
off
from
time
with
their
parents
.
And
this
parent
,
who
had
to
tell
her
daughter
no
,
feels
cut
off
spiritually
.
Most
hardly
have
time
,
they
say
,
for
a
relationship
with
God
.
They
have
to
ask
for
leave
to
attend
the
church
where
that
relationship
happens
.
One
feels
guilty
,
even
dishonest
to
God
.
A
University
that
enshrines
the
academic
freedom
of
everyone
while
obstructing
anyone’s
rights
to
practice
their
religion
and
be
present
in
the
lives
of
their
children
voids
its
claim
to
pronounce
on
anything
that
really
matters
.
No
wonder
,
that
your
pledge
to
serve
our
community
has
never
been
stronger
and
will
only
grow
that
such
banal
assurances
of
our
good
intent
for
Durham
are
,
in
Shakespeare’s
phrase
,
but
as
the
cuckoo
is
in
June
.
Heard
,
not
regarded
.
But
I
know
that
not
only
you
are
reading
this
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
we
students
follow
along
and
roll
our
eyes
and
lament
Duke’s
continued
abuse
of
its
workers
.
I
speak
now
to
them
.
You
hypocrite
,
first
take
the
log
out
of
your
own
eye
,
and
then
you
will
see
clearly
to
take
the
speck
out
of
your
neighbor’s
eye
.
Matthew
,
chapter
7
,
verse
5
.
Do
you
wonder
why
we
treat
our
workers
like
dronish
drudges
?
One
worker
said
in
September
seven
months
ago
that
students
were
complaining
about
the
bathroom
on
Sundays
,
and
so
they
got
seven
day
coverage
.
We
are
the
problem
.
We
leave
our
bathrooms
so
filthy
that
lives
are
disrupted
.
Time
that
can
never
be
gotten
back
is
lost
.
We
do
not
hesitate
to
disrespect
the
human
dignity
of
the
human
beings
who
keep
our
homes
clean
,
and
how
do
they
react
?
Are
they
made
at
our
entitled
cruelties
?
No
.
They
are
concerned
for
their
community
.
One
worker
would
not
miss
their
weekend
shifts
because
their
coworkers
would
have
to
pick
up
the
slack
.
All
our
classes
and
clubs
and
conferences
and
time
abroad
,
and
we
know
nothing
of
caring
for
a
community
.
A
housekeeper
and
a
Duke
student
are
different
.
The
housekeeper
asks
,
What
about
them
?
The
Duke
student
asks
,
What
about
me
?
Do
you
feel
that
I
have
mischaracterized
you
?
Perhaps
you
confuse
your
participation
in
DukeEngage
with
a
wholehearted
interest
in
human
welfare
.
Do
not
be
proud
that
you
gave
up
ten
weekends
one
summer
when
your
mess
robs
housekeepers
of
most
every
other
weekend
they
have
.
Perhaps
you
think
that
your
hour
or
two
every
week
or
so
of
volunteering
makes
up
for
the
days
you
rob
.
No
,
you
are
not
a
bad
person
.
You
are
only
a
hypocrite
who
callously
ignores
the
harm
that
blooms
from
your
rank
unkindness
.
Why
is
it
that
we
only
care
about
Durham
in
the
abstract
?
We
spilled
so
much
ink
over
Duke’s
involvement
or
rather
,
non
involvement
in
the
Durham
light
rail
.
We
saw
the
numbers
in
a
ledger
that
showed
the
harm
Duke
would
do
to
Durham
,
and
we
spent
weeks
parsing
out
the
issue
.
And
yet
we
cannot
be
bothered
to
be
concerned
with
the
welfare
of
the
flesh
and
blood
Durhamites
whom
no
one
could
blame
if
they
left
us
tomorrow
.

I
close
with
a
final
question
and
a
final
request
.
To
President
Price
will
you
give
these
housekeeping
staff
their
lives
outside
of
Duke
?
You
are
the
President
of
this
University
.
It
is
in
your
power
to
achieve
.
Your
promise
to
make
Duke
North
Carolina’s
best
employer
can
be
either
a
vain
hypocrisy
or
a
point
of
institutional
pride
.
It
cannot
be
both
.
And
my
request
,
to
students
since
Mommy
and
Daddy
are
not
here
to
pick
up
your
mess
,
act
like
the
adults
you
pretend
to
be
and
take
responsibility
for
your
own
spaces
.
It
has
come
to
my
attention
that
there
are
those
who
regard
the
titling
scheme
I
follow
for
many
of
my
columns
as
clickbait
.
They
argue
that
I
design
my
columns
to
simply
derive
the
most
views
possible
and
provoke
a
reaction
.
To
a
degree
,
they
are
right
.
I
do
purposefully
design
the
titles
of
my
articles
to
be
interesting
,
thought
provoking
,
and
attention
grabbing
.
I
have
been
and
will
always
be
transparent
about
my
intentions
I
want
people
to
read
my
columns
.
For
the
sake
of
further
transparency
,
I
also
want
my
readers
to
offer
feedback
as
well
.
I
want
feedback
regardless
of
whether
readers
enjoy
or
despise
a
particular
column
and
regardless
of
whether
they
offer
coherent
,
useful
criticism
or
simply
inform
me
,
as
one
commenter
did
,
that
Reiss
.
You
are
full
of
crap
.
Thank
you
.
I
can
assure
you
that
after
a
weeklong
spring
break
vacation
that
was
both
really
fun
and
also
excessively
indulgent
that
I
am
,
literally
,
full
of
crap
.
Cruises
are
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
and
they
are
definitely
not
for
those
with
bad
cholesterol
.
That
being
said
,
I
am
not
full
of
crap
for
arguing
that
young
men
who
produce
economic
value
should
be
compensated
for
the
value
they
produce
.
Even
as
I
may
be
full
of
crap
,
that
argument
is
steeped
in
truth
,
oriented
toward
equity
,
and
derived
from
the
dignity
of
all
men
,
despite
the
anger
of
Facebook’s
basketball
reactionaries
.
But
I
digress
.
Let’s
acknowledge
some
more
self
evident
truths
.
Here’s
one
there
is
an
intra
organizational
competition
for
eyeballs
within
The
Chronicle
itself
.
I
wish
there
were
not
such
a
competition
and
that
each
columnist
simply
received
their
fair
share
of
views
in
some
abstract
,
objective
sense
,
but
that
is
not
the
case
.
So
in
acknowledgement
of
that
reality
,
I
fight
.
I
fight
for
views
,
I
fight
for
engagement
,
I
fight
for
some
modicum
of
influence
over
the
opinions
of
my
fellow
Duke
students
and
the
body
politic
,
no
matter
how
small
that
influence
may
be
.
I
fight
by
writing
titles
that
capture
people’s
attention
.
I
continue
that
fight
by
writing
content
that
is
,
ideally
,
engaging
and
thought
provoking
,
challenging
and
constructive
.
I
finish
that
fight
by
trying
to
source
my
articles
adequately
,
by
comprehensively
editing
with
the
help
of
my
amazing
editors
,
and
by
trying
to
answer
questions
,
address
concerns
,
and
respond
to
every
utterance
of
hey
,
your
opinion
sucks
.
To
the
latter
,
I
always
respond
Okay
,
why
?
My
desired
end
is
engagement
.
I
could
create
sanitized
,
straightforward
and
less
provocative
titles
.
For
instance
,
I
wrote
a
column
titled
Housing
reform
betrays
Duke’s
diversity
.
That
is
a
big
,
bold
interesting
statement
.
I
could
have
titled
that
piece
A
new
perspective
on
the
development
of
housing
reform
.
The
alternative
title
would
have
remained
true
to
the
content
of
the
piece
I
do
give
a
new
perspective
on
housing
reform
,
but
it
would
have
failed
to
display
attributes
I
valued
in
the
original
,
more
provocative
title
.
For
one
,
fewer
people
would
have
read
it
because
that
title
is
bland
,
unoriginal
,
and
essentially
a
copy
of
a
dozen
other
faceless
articles
that
have
been
written
about
Housing
Reform
.
Instead
,
I
used
my
original
title
,
Housing
reform
betrays
Duke’s
diversity
,
to
emphasize
my
differences
with
the
majority
of
the
Housing
Reform
advocates
while
simultaneously
making
a
bold
statement
,
that
I
subsequently
back
up
in
writing
,
about
how
their
proposals
fall
short
.
Let
me
be
clear
I
make
my
titles
provocative
and
engaging
to
attract
readers
,
but
I
will
also
defend
my
titles
on
the
merits
.
All
my
titles
are
simultaneously
provocative
and
substantive
in
that
they
attract
attention
but
they
also
accurately
reflect
my
argument
.
For
instance
in
my
last
column
called
An
open
letter
to
Zion
Williamson
Don’t
come
back
,
I
start
with
what
was
,
clearly
,
an
extremely
inflammatory
opener
.
But
I
back
the
title
up
!
Agree
or
not
,
the
book
matched
its
cover
and
therein
I
did
express
what
I
felt
were
good
reasons
for
why
Zion
should
not
come
back
.
You
can
say
my
reasoning
was
full
of
crap
,
but
the
title
is
not
.
Ultimately
,
I
appreciate
clickbait
titling
because
it
is
honest
.
At
least
more
honest
than
the
supposedly
more
dignified
and
reserved
alternative
methods
of
titling
.
Clickbait
is
an
honest
expression
of
why
people
read
opinion
journalism
or
casually
go
online
in
general
.
Whether
we
are
conscious
of
it
or
not
,
we
do
not
read
newspapers
for
raw
information
or
out
of
some
sense
of
intellectual
or
civic
obligation
.
We
consume
content
to
escape
.
Worn
down
by
the
troubles
and
travails
of
everyday
life
,
the
petty
squabbles
and
nagging
problems
,
we
browse
our
feeds
to
broaden
our
perspective
past
our
own
lives
and
to
leave
the
existential
wear
and
tear
behind
us
,
at
least
briefly
.
When
we
read
opinion
sections
,
when
we
engage
with
something
that
,
for
lack
of
a
better
phrase
,
gets
the
people
going
we
detach
from
our
humdrum
problems
and
are
able
to
focus
on
something
else
.
So
yes
,
I
offer
escapism
.
Hopefully
it’s
of
a
high
caliber
.
Ideally
,
my
articles
are
interesting
,
informative
and
worth
the
time
spent
reading
.
At
the
same
time
,
not
all
forms
of
clickbait
are
created
equal
.
Most
clickbait
is
utter
dreck
.
Whether
or
not
my
content
is
high
quality
is
up
to
the
estimation
of
the
reader
.
But
the
reader
cannot
make
that
estimation
unless
they
read
it
.
I
hope
that
my
readers
think
about
ideas
that
are
larger
than
any
of
us
and
issues
that
have
significant
,
fundamental
implications
for
how
human
society
operates
.
I
know
I
think
bigger
than
myself
each
time
I
write
a
column
.
I
think
about
the
readers
,
I
think
about
who
I
want
the
readers
to
be
,
I
think
about
how
said
readers
will
respond
,
and
I
think
about
how
those
responses
can
be
rebutted
most
effectively
.
More
than
that
,
I
think
about
the
change
I
want
to
see
in
the
world
and
what
I
can
do
,
with
my
limited
platform
,
to
make
any
sort
of
a
positive
impact
.
For
me
,
clickbait
is
a
means
,
not
an
end
.
It
is
a
means
to
excite
people
and
thus
encourage
engagement
with
ideas
I
care
about
and
think
others
should
care
about
too
.
If
accusations
of
clickbait
and
Facebook
comments
are
the
worst
slings
and
arrows
I
face
,
then
I
am
blessed
to
be
a
columnist
for
The
Chronicle
.
Until
next
time
,
and
thanks

From
desperate
housing
inquiries
posted
on
the
All
Duke
Facebook
page
to
petition
links
on
Duke
Memes
for
Gothicc
Teens
,
it
was
hard
to
miss
the
controversy
currently
surrounding
Duke’s
Housing
and
Residence
Life
at
the
end
of
last
month
.
Several
resident
assistants
RAs
on
East
Campus
were
told
to
pack
their
bags
and
turn
in
their
keys
for
reasons
related
to
their
participation
in
the
time
honored
,
Duke
beloved
tradition
of
black
tenting
for
the
UNC
Duke
game
.
While
RAs
are
technically
permitted
to
tent
,
the
actual
letter
of
the
policy
is
vague
and
enforcement
from
HRL
has
not
been
consistent
,
according
to
RAs
.
Though
two
of
the
three
RAs
fired
have
since
been
reinstated
,
these
recent
terminations
of
undergraduate
student
workers
on
the
grounds
of
a
vague
and
unequally
applied
policy
prompted
vocal
opposition
from
the
Duke
community
.
A
student
petition
in
support
of
reinstating
the
fired
RAs
accrued
more
than
750
signatures
and
hundreds
of
comments
.
In
the
official
RA
Role
Description
,
HRL’s
stance
on
tenting
is
that
resident
assistants
can
participate
if
desired
in
'tenting'
in
a
limited
manner
.
The
Expectations
and
Eligibility
Requirements
section
further
states
that
tenting
stipulations
are
to
be
released
once
the
head
line
monitor
releases
guidelines
regarding
the
tenting
process
,
but
applying
that
policy
remains
with
HRL
officials
.
While
HRL
does
have
an
appeal
process
for
claims
of
wrongful
termination
and
two
of
the
RAs
were
rehired
through
it
,
the
haste
in
which
the
offending
parties
are
expected
to
vacate
their
dorms
is
alarming
.
The
terminated
RAs
were
initially
expected
to
have
moved
out
of
the
dorm
by
the
end
of
the
week
,
despite
only
receiving
official
notification
of
their
discharge
via
email
a
few
days
before
.
The
status
of
their
meal
plan
if
their
appeals
are
rejected
has
not
been
explicitly
reported
.
While
these
sudden
mass
firings
have
rightfully
upset
large
swaths
of
residents
at
Duke
,
this
is
only
one
example
out
of
the
many
systemic
labor
problems
that
resident
assistants
face
.
Per
their
contract
,
RAs
are
expected
to
complete
no
more
than
15
hours
of
work
in
their
role
per
week
.
However
,
realistically
,
if
an
RA
were
to
be
on
call
more
than
two
nights
a
week
,
they
could
easily
exceed
this
ceiling
.
Furthermore
,
RAs
are
only
allowed
eight
pre
approved
leave
days
per
semester
.
This
means
that
even
when
not
working
,
RAs
are
required
to
return
to
their
rooms
by
no
later
than
3
a
.
m
.
outside
of
these
eight
nights
,
excluding
vacations
or
trips
home
during
Spring
and
Fall
Breaks
.
Although
Duke
specifically
forbids
students
on
work
study
from
working
more
than
20
hours
a
week
partly
to
protect
students
from
over
exerting
themselves
the
administration
apparently
has
no
problem
overworking
RAs
who
are
supposedly
exempt
from
such
restrictions
.
This
is
all
in
addition
to
floor
programming
,
attending
weekly
house
council
meetings
,
building
meaningful
connections
with
residents
and
frequent
team
meetings
.
Despite
the
immense
amount
of
work
required
to
succeed
in
the
role
,
Duke
does
not
deem
the
relationship
between
the
university
and
its
RAs
as
one
of
employment
.
Rather
,
it
is
considered
a
relationship
with
the
implication
that
if
RAs
are
not
employees
,
they
cannot
collectively
bargain
despite
the
precedent
set
by
the
National
Labor
Relations
Board
two
years
ago
.
In
2017
,
the
NLRB
ruled
in
favor
of
the
right
of
resident
advisers
at
George
Washington
University
to
unionize
,
a
decision
largely
based
off
of
a
ruling
from
2016
that
established
that
graduate
students
have
collective
bargaining
rights
.
Duke
has
discouraged
unionization
efforts
in
recent
years
from
adjunct
faculty
and
graduate
students
,
going
as
far
as
to
pay
top
dollar
for
large
law
firms
to
counter
efforts
.
Beyond
these
pre
existing
issues
,
HRL’s
recent
termination
decisions
calls
into
question
their
commitment
to
promoting
the
best
environment
for
the
residents
that
the
RAs
care
for
.
Resident
assistants
are
more
than
people
who
respond
to
lock
out
calls
after
Devine's
has
closed
for
the
night
,
or
the
peers
who
help
you
through
your
first
few
painfully
awkward
weeks
as
a
college
student
.
To
their
residents
,
great
RAs
become
consistent
resources
,
confidants
and
trusted
authorities
.
In
essence
,
they
are
students’
first
line
of
resources
in
dealing
with
the
pitfalls
of
the
transition
into
independence
.
Especially
in
light
of
the
recent
survey
findings
on
increased
sexual
assault
rates
at
Duke
and
numerous
recent
hate
speech
related
incidents
on
campus
,
the
presence
of
trusted
RAs
to
confide
in
are
more
vital
than
ever
.
By
unceremoniously
severing
the
meticulously
built
relationships
RAs
have
with
their
residents
,
students
are
left
with
a
gaping
hole
in
their
support
networks
.
The
precariousness
of
RA
employment
undermines
the
very
conditions
HRL
claims
the
RA
position
is
designed
to
foster
and
maintain
.
Resident
Assistants
are
indispensable
parts
of
so
many
Duke
students’
time
on
campus
.
And
,
regardless
of
what
Duke
may
classify
them
as
,
they
are
who
are
dedicated
to
one
of
the
most
time
consuming
,
emotionally
intensive
and
often
stressful
jobs
that
undergraduates
can
have
here
.
The
recent
terminations
have
brought
to
light
just
how
strenuous
and
precarious
these
roles
can
be
;
the
students
that
work
tirelessly
to
look
after
their
peers
and
foster
a
community
everyone
can
feel
apart
of
,
deserve
better
.
Not
only
did
the
resident
assistants
fired
for
tenting
deserve
to
be
reinstated
,
RAs
deserve
a
union
and
the
collective
security
to
make
sure
they
can
continue
to
serve
the
Duke
community
to
the
best
of
their
abilities
.
Even
for
ardent
politicos
,
it
is
becoming
increasingly
difficult
to
keep
up
with
the
number
of
Democrats
entering
the
2020
primary
.
From
the
obscure
to
old
blue
heavyweights
,
each
politician
in
the
super
field
of
candidates
is
seeking
to
gain
attention
on
the
national
stage
,
and
to
convince
voting
Americans
that
they
are
best
suited
to
lead
the
country
in
what
is
to
be
one
of
the
most
consequential
elections
of
the
21st
century
.
Yet
,
even
with
the
litany
of
Democratic
choices
,
many
are
already
hostage
to
the
VoteBlue
mindset
,
prepared
to
support
mediocre
candidates
on
account
of
winnability
over
Trump
.
The
current
slate
of
Democratic
candidates
stands
at
sixteen
with
many
more
expected
to
announce
in
the
near
future
.
To
name
a
few
,
Senators
Bernie
Sanders
,
Kamala
Harris
,
Elizabeth
Warren
and
Cory
Booker
have
all
been
considered
consensus
contenders
since
the
aftermath
of
the
2016
election
.
Moreover
,
political
outsiders
who
have
gained
recent
notoriety
,
like
Beto
O’Rourke
,
Andrew
Yang
and
Pete
Buttigieg
,
are
also
throwing
their
name
into
the
circus
.
Democrats
are
facing
several
problems
in
forging
an
articulable
,
unified
approach
to
beating
the
ideals
of
Trumpism
on
the
long
road
to
2020
.
Cory
Booker
is
preaching
about
universal
love
at
a
time
of
increasing
partisan
polarization
,
while
Elizabeth
Warren
is
pitching
herself
as
a
nerdy
Harvard
policy
wonk
.
Meanwhile
,
more
moderate
candidates
like
O’Rourke
and
Biden
are
courting
America
as
amiable
,
unthreatening
white
men
,
willing
to
crack
open
a
Pabst
Blue
with
the
boys
after
a
long
day
of
campaigning
.
Undoubtedly
,
despite
the
candidates’
attempts
to
stand
out
,
all
will
have
to
grapple
with
a
key
issue
of
the
2016
election
and
the
basis
of
Trump’s
ideology
the
myth
of
the
declining
white
,
working
class
male
.
This
myth
is
part
of
Trump’s
larger
dog
whistle
politics
that
seeks
to
bolster
white
solidarity
and
prejudice
in
the
American
political
scene
.
Clearly
,
trafficking
in
white
identity
politics
is
effective
;
after
all
,
white
voters
disproportionately
cast
their
ballots
for
Trump
in
the
2016
election
,
partly
as
a
result
of
his
pandering
to
the
far
right
.
While
progressive
stalwarts
have
monopolized
the
2020
scene
,
more
moderate
Democrats
remain
the
frontrunners
.
Joe
Biden
,
who
has
not
even
announced
his
candidacy
,
has
consistently
lead
in
the
polls
.
Senator
Amy
Klobuchar
,
once
a
little
known
senator
who
would
occasionally
make
the
rounds
on
Sunday
night
talk
shows
,
has
been
praised
by
the
media
for
her
Midwestern
cool
and
Minnesota
nice
.
However
,
Klobuchar’s
campaign
has
recently
been
bogged
by
claims
of
alleged
binder
throwing
and
chronic
abuse
to
her
overworked
political
staff
.
While
Biden
and
Klobuchar
have
both
gotten
the
likable
media
treatment
,
their
success
shows
a
general
shift
towards
the
political
center
for
many
Democratic
primary
voters
,
and
a
pandering
towards
a
mythical
white
demographic
from
the
clutches
of
a
Trumpified
GOP
.
A
lack
of
authenticity
,
both
in
character
and
in
platforms
,
also
remains
an
issue
for
many
candidates
in
the
race
.
The
political
circus
of
the
Kavanaugh
hearings
in
which
Cory
Booker
had
his
Spartacus
moment
seemed
like
a
performative
career
stunt
at
best
.
Doing
her
best
to
appeal
to
a
younger
,
millennial
demographic
,
Kamala
Harris
boasted
of
smoking
weed
in
college
and
listening
to
Snoop
Dogg
on
national
radio
,
despite
having
graduated
college
well
before
Snoop
Dogg's
first
album
debut
.
Moreover
,
the
lack
of
clear
,
unique
platforms
is
troubling
.
Instead
,
in
competing
for
airtime
and
headlines
,
fiery
rhetoric
about
Trump
,
his
GOP
sidekicks
and
their
failures
are
often
employed
in
place
of
substantive
conversations
on
policy
.
Kirtsen
Gillibrand
,
for
example
,
launched
her
campaign
by
lambasting
Trump
in
front
of
one
of
his
New
York
properties
hardly
a
differential
characteristic
from
the
rest
of
the
field
.
As
a
result
of
the
identity
politics
employed
by
both
sides
,
the
leading
narratives
amongst
left
leaning
voters
are
that
we
must
vote
blue
regardless
,
and
that
we
must
elect
someone
from
the
primary
who
is
most
winning
or
likable
.
Unfortunately
,
this
leaves
the
door
open
for
mediocre
candidates
to
cajole
a
divided
voting
base
by
harnessing
their
celebrity
power
as
the
cool
candidate
.
Amidst
this
digital
beauty
pageant
that
has
become
the
race
to
be
Ms
.
Democratic
Candidate
2020
,
we
should
look
beyond
the
metaphorical
bathing
suits
and
hackneyed
world
peace
!
responses
among
the
many
generic
candidates
in
a
crowded
field
.
Given
the
state
of
presidential
politics
post
Trump
,
however
,
it
is
likely
that
any
candidate
wishing
to
make
themselves
electable
will
have
to
focus
,
in
part
,
on
selling
themselves
as
bland
,
photo
shopped
celebrities
who
enjoy
smoking
weed
and
playing
punk
rock
.
Are
you
the
shy
one
or
the
talkative
one
?
I
grew
up
being
one
half
of
a
pair
.
My
twin
sister
and
I
were
a
package
deal
,
ready
for
double
dutch
,
double
dates
and
double
the
trouble
.
We
were
two
peas
in
a
pod
with
four
left
feet
.
Even
though
our
family
and
friends
could
tell
us
apart
,
strangers
could
not
,
and
as
a
result
,
I
have
walked
through
life
with
a
blurrier
sense
of
where
my
own
identity
ends
and
hers
begins
.
So
we
are
left
to
define
ourselves
by
our
personalities
the
funny
one
and
the
serious
one
,
the
headstrong
sister
and
the
shy
sister
.
There
seem
to
be
a
million
and
one
ways
to
quantify
the
ways
in
which
humans
interact
with
each
other
and
the
world
.
The
Myers
Briggs
test
sorts
us
into
sixteen
categories
each
with
a
different
lettered
code’
.
The
Enneagram
assigns
us
each
a
number
,
one
through
nine
,
and
focuses
on
how
yours
interacts
with
adjacent
and
opposite
numbers
when
arranged
in
a
circle
.
Believers
in
astrology
sort
people
according
to
their
date
of
birth
and
rely
on
planetary
alignments
in
order
to
draw
conclusions
about
their
personalities
and
predict
life
events
.
Some
people
decipher
personality
traits
through
reading
the
energy
surrounding
one’s
body
,
called
an
aura
,
and
assign
it
a
color
which
changes
depending
on
emotion
.
So
if
I
told
you
I
am
a
Gemini
,
Enneagram
2
,
ENFP
,
and
my
aura
is
bright
yellow
with
a
hint
of
violet
,
what
would
you
really
know
about
me
?
Just
a
bunch
of
adjectives
grouped
together
,
like
compassionate
,
kind
,
extroverted
and
cheerful
,
which
are
meant
to
sum
up
my
existence
.
These
categories
have
always
struck
me
as
arbitrary
,
but
there’s
an
entire
field
of
study
based
on
it
the
cult
of
personality
testing
.
I
don’t
know
if
there
is
a
Myers
Briggs
code
for
someone
who
is
skeptical
of
personality
tests
,
but
I
have
a
feeling
it
might
be
H
O
A
X
.
Personality
traits
can
predict
life
outcomes
,
according
to
a
study
conducted
by
Dr
.
Avshalom
Caspi
,
a
Duke
professor
of
neuroscience
and
psychology
.
Caspi
tested
how
personality
traits
predicted
divorce
,
mortality
and
occupational
attainment
.
The
study
reported
that
even
when
factors
of
socioeconomic
background
and
intelligence
were
taken
into
account
,
personality
traits
did
have
an
effect
in
predicting
levels
of
occupational
attainment
.
Translation
personalities
have
power
.
Extroverts
were
more
likely
to
assume
roles
in
leadership
;
people
who
are
more
conscientious
may
prefer
jobs
such
as
accounting
or
farming
.
The
study
also
indicated
that
when
people
find
jobs
which
align
with
their
personalities
,
they
will
perform
better
in
those
jobs
,
which
should
lead
to
greater
success
and
happiness
across
their
lives
.
The
diagnostic
tests
I’ve
had
to
complete
in
professional
settings
might
be
helpful
than
I
once
thought
.
If
personality
traits
have
an
effect
on
the
way
we
live
every
day
,
then
maybe
the
tests
which
sort
us
into
these
types
,
codes
and
colors
are
worthy
of
study
after
all
.
Personality
tests
give
us
the
language
to
talk
about
the
differences
between
ourselves
and
others
in
a
relatively
value
neutral
way
.
And
,
regardless
of
if
it
works
or
not
,
the
act
of
deciphering
personality
traits
is
fun
.
There’s
something
intoxicating
about
recognizing
little
parts
of
yourself
in
other
people
aligning
our
idiosyncrasies
,
strengths
and
fears
in
order
to
situate
ourselves
in
a
larger
narrative
.
Growing
up
as
part
of
a
pair
meant
our
personalities
could
complement
each
other
when
we
needed
it
most
.
Her
easygoing
calmness
meant
I
could
be
a
tornado
of
chaos
,
and
my
willingness
to
speak
meant
she
didn’t
ever
have
to
answer
the
phone
or
order
from
a
menu
at
a
restaurant
.
In
some
ways
,
what
has
been
the
hardest
part
of
experiencing
college
in
separate
places
is
how
we've
had
to
grow
on
our
own
without
each
other
to
fill
in
the
gaps
.
This
is
what
makes
measuring
personalities
so
challenging
they
change
.
Over
time
our
shyness
turns
into
confidence
and
our
chaos
transforms
into
wisdom
.
People
are
more
complicated
than
the
boxes
personality
tests
places
us
in
because
those
boxes
only
can
measure
who
we
are
at
one
particular
moment
,
not
the
sum
of
our
childhoods
and
inside
jokes
and
embarrassing
moments
and
dreams
for
the
future

a

In

student

DGSU
pointed
out
in
an
guest
column
last

,
Duke’s
previous
policy
of
awarding
stipends
left
a
considerable
gap
between
the
official
cost
of
living
in
Durham
verses
the
University’s
guaranteed

.
As
the
region’s
economy
and
population

to

,
rent

and
the

of

the

have
been
on

students
,
struggling
to
make
ends
meet
on
a
sum
of
money
deemed
low
income
by
the
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
,
this
increase
will
undoubtedly
be
greeted
with
relief
and
consolation
.
Especially
at
a
time
when
universities
all
across
the
country
are
moving
toward
increasing
the
number
of
adjunct
faculty
at
the
expense
of
tenured
academic
positions
,
providing
our
graduate
students
with
stable
finances
as
they
finish
their
studies
and
enter
an
unstable
workforce
should
be
important
to
administrators
.
More
fundamentally
,
the
stipend
increase
represents
an
acknowledgement
by
the
University
of
the
significant
labor
graduate
students
contribute
to
research
and
teaching
.
Often
having
to
juggle
a
strenuous
schedule
of
dissertation
research
,
lab
,
teaching
,
assisting
professors
with
teaching
and
research
,
classwork
,
and
exams
,
many
graduate
students
feel
overwhelmed
by
their
many
conflicting
responsibilities
.
So
much
so
that
a
study
by
Harvard
found
that
graduate
students
at
elite
universities
like
Duke
although
the
University
was
not
included
in
the
study
are
more
likely
to
experience
depression
and
anxiety
than
the
national
average
.
Under
the
official
definition
by
the
University
,
however
,
graduate
students
are
not
treated
as
employees
,
but
rather
scholars
receiving
specific
scholarships
in
the
name
of
research
in
an
academic
setting
,
hence
the
term
stipend
to
define
compensation
to
Ph
.
D
.
candidates
.
Notwithstanding
Duke’s
official
treatment
of
Ph
.
D
.
students
as
non
salaried
employees
,
it
is
gratifying
to
see
the
University
recognize
the
financial
predicament
of
many
of
its
scholars
and
to
rectify
it
through
increasing
the
amount
of
guaranteed
stipend
funding
.
Of
course
,
the
University’s
decision
would
not
have
been
possible
had
it
not
been
for
Duke
Graduate
Students
Union
.
The
group
formed
a
few
years
ago
and
pushed
for
official
unionization
,
but
withdrew
its
petition
in
2017
after
an
inconclusive
vote
on
unionization
.
Over
the
last
few
years
,
the
union
has
represented
divisive
issue
on
campus
,
with
graduate
students
and
administrators
voicing
divergent
opinions
on
the
appropriateness
of
a
union
within
a
university
setting
.
In
the
past
,
both
President
Brodhead
and
Duke’s
current
President
Price
have
publicly
stated
their
disapproval
for
a
graduate
student
union
,
criticizing
it
as
an
ineffective
vehicle
for
advocacy
.
Even
among
graduate
students
,
the
issue
has
remained
controversial
,
with
some
individuals
arguing
that
unionization
could
potentially
jeopardize
academic
freedom
and
relationships
with
professors
as
entire
academic
departments
come
under
bureaucratic
,
third
party
regulations
.
Regardless
of
the
controversy
behind
graduate
student
unionization
and
the
antagonistic
relationship
between
DGSU
and
the
administration
,
the
stipend
increase
represents
a
victory
for
collective
activism
at
Duke

Although
numerous
factors
went
into
the
administration’s
decision
to
raise
the
stipend
,
including
the
work
of
GPSC
,
which
Dean
Paula
McClain
cited
in
the
news
release
announcing
the
decision
,
the
voices
of
the
union
and
many
graduate
students
certainly
played
a
factor
.
Even
for
those
who
disagree
on
whether
labor
unions
are
the
right
approach
for
a
scholarly
setting
such
as
Duke
,
the
stipend
increase
signifies
the
importance
of
raising
specific
concerns
,
such
as
financial
precarity
,
facing
various
sectors
of
the
campus
community
to
the
ear
of
stubborn
administrators
.
Like
with
so
many
other
facets
of
Duke
the
University’s
African
and
African
American
Studies
Department
and
Asian
American
Studies
,
for
instance
change
often
arrives
only
through
collective
organizing
,
even
if
such
organizing
proves
to
be
initially
antagonistic
and
controversial
.
The
pink
magnolia
flowers
are
a
popular
photo
spot
.
It
seems
like
the
cherry
blossoms
are
in
bloom
for
good
this
time
.
For
the
past
month
,
we
have
been
getting
glimpses
at
what
spring
looks
like
at
Duke
.
In
the
past
two
weeks
,
we
have
seen
spring
in
full
bloom
and
there
is
no
going
back
.
Duke
students
know
what
to
do
this
time
of
year
even
first
years
who
haven’t
experienced
spring
on
campus
before
.
As
soon
as
the
temperatures
plateau
around
75
degrees
and
the
clouds
roll
away
,
students
hang
hammocks
,
head
to
the
gardens
and
repopulate
the
Bryan
Center
plaza
.
It
seems
like
this
resurgence
of
half
decent
weather
is
gladly
welcomed
on
campus
.
Yet
,
I
write
this
article
trapped
inside
of
a
lecture
for
a
class
that
is
almost
completely
self
taught
.
After
this
class
ends
,
I’ll
head
out
to
another
seminar
where
attendance
is
mandatory
.
After
that
,
I’ll
head
to
a
discussion
section
that
only
grants
me
two
missed
absences
a
semester
.
Most
of
the
year
I
am
willing
to
schlep
myself
from
class
to
class
even
if
only
to
take
advantage
of
attendance
points
.
But
,
when
it
looks
this
good
outside
,
I
find
it
painstakingly
difficult
to
make
it
to
class
.
The
decision
is
a
pretty
clear
one
I
could
either
go
to
class
and
save
my
grade
,
or
go
outdoors
and
save
my
emotional
well
being
.
If
we
take
a
close
look
,
we
see
the
same
sort
of
tradeoffs
in
many
areas
of
Duke
life
choosing
between
enjoying
a
night
out
with
friends
or
studying
for
a
test
,
for
example
.
This
decision
is
compounded
in
the
spring
,
when
the
sun
finally
returns
.
I
,
like
many
of
my
undiagnosed
and
potentially
unaware
peers
,
have
a
mild
case
of
seasonal
affective
disorder
.
SAD
,
as
it
is
appropriately
abbreviated
,
brings
about
a
state
of
melancholy
due
to
unfavorable
weather
conditions
gray
skies
,
rainy
mornings
and
somber
afternoons
.
Most
of
the
year
at
Duke
is
laden
with
conditions
ripe
for
my
SAD
ness
.
Like
clockwork
,
I
fall
into
a
routine
to
overcome
the
gloom
that
hits
Durham
every
late
September
.
I
force
myself
to
go
to
class
because
staying
in
bed
would
be
worse
for
my
mental
health
.
I
spend
late
nights
in
Perkins
because
I
would
be
spending
that
time
indoors
anyways
.
Any
fun
I
have
with
my
friends
takes
place
in
the
confines
of
our
common
room
because
the
weather
eliminates
the
possibility
of
frisbee
or
Spikeball
on
the
quad
.
Most
of
the
year
,
I
am
forced
inside
.
It’s
easy
,
then
,
to
stay
academically
afloat
.
If
I
have
to
be
inside
,
I
might
as
well
go
to
class
or
the
library
.
I’d
rather
stick
my
head
in
the
proverbial
books
that
spend
a
minute
in
the
frosty
Durham
winter
.
As
a
result
,
my
grades
spike
as
the
temperature
drops
.
But
then
spring
comes
.
The
sun
peeks
out
from
behind
silver
lined
clouds
.
My
mood
,
like
the
temperature
,
begins
to
rise
with
every
inch
toward
a
sweltering
summer
.
No
longer
am
I
forced
to
flee
the
dreary
outdoors
.
No
longer
am
I
bound
to
a
routine
predicated
on
beating
out
my
seasonal
affective
disorder
.
I
feel
reinvigorated
.
I
feel
renewed
.
The
only
problem
is
that
my
shift
in
attitude
does
not
re
energize
me
to
end
the
semester
strong
it
does
the
opposite
.
Where
I
used
to
feel
like
I
had
to
go
to
class
,
I
now
feel
like
it
is
my
obligation
to
skip
class
and
actually
have
fun
.
Slowly
but
surely
classes
are
skipped
,
midterms
go
unstudied
for
,
and
responsibilities
are
avoided
.
The
impact
on
my
academic
life
is
substantial
enough
to
remind
me
that
I
am
still
a
student
whose
primary
responsibility
is
to
study
.
But
,
at
this
point
in
the
semester
,
I
am
ready
to
risk
it
all
to
just
go
outdoors
.
What
do
I
do
instead
of
what
I
am
supposed
to
do
?
I
,
like
most
other
Duke
students
,
take
advantage
of
the
weather
.
I
hang
my
hammock
in
a
hidden
spot
between
my
two
favorite
trees
on
campus
.
I
pass
frisbees
with
my
friends
in
the
gardens
.
I
take
long
walks
around
the
graduate
schools
.
I
spend
entirely
too
long
eating
meals
on
the
swinging
benches
on
the
BC
plaza
.
Not
only
are
these
activities
fun
for
me
,
but
they
actually
improve
my
mental
health
.
For
the
past
seven
months
,
I
have
had
to
cope
with
overarching
grayness
of
my
life
at
Duke
.
Some
of
that
grayness
is
reflected
in
my
more
pessimistic
columns
from
the
year
.
Now
that
the
sun
has
returned
and
made
me
less
SAD
,
I
have
begun
to
enjoy
my
experiences
on
campus
significantly
more
.
It
is
such
a
shame
,
however
,
that
maximizing
and
enjoying
my
Duke
experience
has
to
come
at
the
expense
of
GPA
points
stripped
away
for
classes
missed
and
assignments
forgotten
.
So
,
while
it
is
the
case
that
spring
is
on
the
rise
and
my
GPA
is
about
to
fall
,
I
know
it
is
only
temporary
.
When
I
return
for
my
junior
year
things
will
turn
gray
and
my
performance
in
school
will
improve
.
What
a
sad
reality
.
The
other
day
,
I
finished
giving
a
campus
tour
and
stood
around
on
Abele
Quad
to
answer
any
last
remaining
questions
that
the
visitors
had
.
One
mother
came
up
to
me
and
said
,
So
you’re
graduating
soon
Whoa
,
slow
down
!
I
had
to
stop
her
.
But
she
looked
back
at
me
blankly
and
said
,
Well
,
you’re
a
junior
,
right
?
As
I
fumbled
for
the
words
to
explain
that
,
and
then
running
out
of
my
room
to
ask
my
parents
to
read
it
for
themselves
,
partially
to
celebrate
but
also
partially
so
they
could
verify
that
I
didn’t
misread
it
.
Take
the
time
to
celebrate
,
because
this
is
no
small
achievement
.
You
worked
hard
to
get
here
.
But
at
the
same
time
,
there’s
a
nuanced
middle
ground
that
acknowledges
both
the
hard
work
you
put
in
as
well
as
the
fact
that
there
are
various
structures
in
place
that
work
in
your
favor
and
give
you
access
to
privilege
.
These
two
are
not
mutually
exclusive
.
Recently
,
Operation
Varsity
Blues
exposed
a
problem
that
we’ve
already
known
existed
for
a
long
time
.
While
no
one
affiliated
with
Duke
was
indicted
,
our
school
is
not
free
from
this
problem
.
There
are
fully
legal
ways
to
have
a
leg
up
in
the
admissions
process
perhaps
your
parents
went
to
Duke
.
Meritocracy
is
a
myth
,
and
identifying
the
structures
that
uphold
a
rigid
hierarchy
under
the
guise
of
meritocracy
is
an
important
step
in
gaining
a
better
understanding
of
Duke
as
an
institution
.
This
is
different
than
situations
in
which
people
may
wrongly
attribute
your
deserved
success
to
factors
such
as
your
gender
or
racial
identity
.
Examples
are
You’re
so
lucky
that
it’s
easier
for
girls
to
get
accepted
into
Pratt
!
and
You
only
got
that
job
because
you’re
black
.
You
might
hear
this
at
home
,
and
it
won’t
magically
stop
when
you
step
foot
on
this
campus
,
but
the
ironic
thing
about
imposter
syndrome
is
that
the
real
imposters
rarely
feel
it
.
You’ll
hear
Duke
referred
to
as
an
elite
institution
,
and
sometimes
people
will
mistake
it
for
one
of
the
Ivy
League
schools
.
This
affects
the
way
that
people
treat
you
and
the
level
of
access
you
have
in
ways
that
are
much
more
subtle
than
an
alumni
network
if
you
haven’t
experienced
this
yet
,
you
will
soon
.
Also
,
think
about
what
it
means
for
a
place
of
higher
education
to
even
be
considered
elite
in
the
first
place
.

When
you
come
to
Duke
in
the
fall
,
there’s
going
to
be
so
much
here
that
you
will
love
.
It
was
at
Duke
where
I
saw
the
gradual
process
of
leaves
changing
color
and
falling
for
the
first
time
,
and
it
was
also
with
Duke
friends
when
I
saw
my
first
snow
in
Pisgah
National
Forest
.
There
will
be
nights
when
you
unintentionally
stay
in
Marketplace
for
three
hours
because
you
keep
running
into
someone
else
that
you
know
,
so
you
keep
them
company
while
they
eat
their
dinner
even
after
you’ve
finished
yours
.
Maybe
you’ll
get
lucky
and
get
assigned
to
live
in
Randolph
,
where
you
can
hold
your
roommate’s
hand
while
you
guys
are
both
in
your
own
beds
not
because
the
rooms
are
small
,
but
because
they’re
You’re
also
going
to
learn
about
major
events
in
our
institutional
memory
from
the
Silent
Vigil
of
1969
and
the
Allen
Building
takeover
in
1969
to
the
more
recent
Allen
Building
takeover
in
2016
and
the
People’s
State
of
the
University
protest
in
2018
.
You’ll
bear
witness
to
our
housekeepers
being
exploited
,
and
scandal
after
scandal
.
Take
the
time
to
make
a
visit
to
Rubenstein
Library
and
spend
an
afternoon
digging
around
our
University
Archives
.
Learning
the
history
of
our
university
provides
context
for
what’s
happening
here
today
and
better
equips
you
to
enact
change
.
Don’t
be
afraid
to
criticize
Duke
,
and
don’t
underestimate
how
much
weight
student
voices
carry
on
this
campus
.
Loving
an
institution
means
that
you
want
to
see
it
improve
as
well
.
I
frequently
joke
with
my
friends
that
I’m
afraid
of
freshmen
.
While
that
may
not
necessarily
be
true
or
is
it
?
,
it
is
true
that
your
status
as
a
first
year
is
not
an
inhibiting
factor
in
any
way
.
Not
only
are
the
same
number
of
doors
open
to
you
,
but
people
are
willing
to
help
you
open
those
very
doors
.
This
campus
is
yours
now
too
,
and
I
can’t
wait
to
share
it
with
you
.
Welcome
to
Duke
.
In
February
,
United
Methodist
Church
officials
and
members
from
all
around
the
world
including
a
delegation
from
the
Duke
Methodist
ministry
in
a
split
vote
decided
to
double
down
on
its
existing
ban
on
LGBTQ
clergy
and
same
sex
marriages
.
While
Duke
as
a
whole
has
not
commented
on
the
decision
,
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
founded
as
a
Methodist
university
,
others
have
spoken
up
.
The
Campus
Minister
of
Duke
Wesley
Duke's
Methodist
congregation
,
responded
to
the
vote
with
a
statement
reaffirming
LGBTQ
people's
place
in
the
Methodist
church
.
Greg
Jones
,
dean
of
Duke's
Divinity
School
,
issued
a
statement
saying
that
he
and
others
are
grieving
the
deep
wounds
to
the
United
Methodist
Church
.
A
columnist
for
The
Chronicle
,
Nathan
Heffernan
,
wrote
an
opinion
piece
calling
for
inclusion
in
religion
the
Catholic
church
,
specifically
.
Clearly
,
there
is
opposition
to
the
vote
and
there
is
support
for
LGBTQ
students
on
campus
,
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
enough
in
the
face
of
larger
religious
institutions
remains
.
In
vocalizing
support
for
LGBTQ
people
,
groups
risk
losing
the
funding
and
legitimacy
that
the
overall
United
Methodist
Church
provides
.
The
same
institutional
pressure
to
uphold
exclusionary
policies
also
exists
in
many
other
ministries
on
campus
.
The
critiques
of
the
UMC
and
other
religious
institutions
are
valid
,
and
Duke
undergraduate
Christian
groups
groups
deserve
similar
scrutiny
.
LGBTQ
students
learn
how
to
navigate
religious
life
at
Duke
solely
through
word
of
mouth
.
The
homophobia
and
transphobia
that
LGBTQ
students
can
face
within
religious
spaces
are
sometimes
taken
as
immutable
qualities
.
Outdated
views
on
gender
and
sexuality
in
spiritual
circles
can
be
alienating
and
put
LGBTQ
individuals
in
a
position
where
they
feel
they
must
between
their
identity
and
faith
.
The
bottom
line
of
all
this
exclusion
is
this
LGBTQ
people
are
suffering
.
Those
who
do
not
yet
have
the
agency
to
leave
these
institutions
are
facing
horrors
such
as
conversion
therapy
.
Those
seeking
religion
and
or
spirituality
of
their
own
accord
are
often
being
turned
away
.
Religious
LGBTQ
people
exist
,
and
they
are
not
walking
oxymorons
.
All
that
exclusion
does
is
harm
vulnerable
congregation
members
.
By
not
taking
identity
affirming
stances
,
religious
organizations
are
failing
to
serve
members
of
their
congregation
both
current
and
prospective
.
Inclusion
of
all
people
in
religious
communities
is
possible
;
in
fact
,
there
are
many
examples
of
it
on
Duke's
campus
alone
.
In
the
Divinity
School
,
LGBTQ
students
have
their
own
student
group
,
Sacred
Worth
.
This
collective
was
represented
among
a
group
of
students
who
presented
a
list
of
LGBTQ
related
demands
at
the
Divinity
School
State
of
the
School
address
last
year
.
Jewish
Life
at
Duke
along
with
many
other
non
Christian
institutions
at
Duke
are
consistently
making
small
,
radical
changes
that
don't
necessarily
make
the
news
.
This
includes
designated
gender
neutral
bathrooms
,
flexibility
when
it
comes
to
gender
specific
religious
rituals
and
sharing
pronouns
at
the
start
of
every
meeting
.
The
discussion
group
,
Queer
and
Trans
Christians
formerly
known
as
Liberating
the
Faith
is
an
intentionally
healing
and
accepting
space
for
undergraduates
who
are
interested
in
exploring
Christianity
while
celebrating
sexuality
and
gender
variance
.
In
the
Triangle
,
there
are
a
number
of
accepting
religious
organizations
and
community
centers
as
well
as
an
interfaith
Religious
Trauma
Support
Group
that
meets
at
the
LGBTQ
Center
of
Durham
every
month
.
LGBTQ
religious
folks
and
allies
have
set
plenty
of
precedents
in
all
faiths
already
.
Religious
groups
that
still
exclude
do
not
have
an
excuse
.
The
United
Methodist
Church's
vote
was
disappointing
and
hurtful
nothing
can
change
that
,
and
nothing
can
erase
that
kind
of
alienating
pain
.
However
,
there
are
existing
spiritual
institutions
doing
meaningful
work
of
making
worship
inclusive
.
LGBTQ
folks
deserve
acceptance
and
although
religion
isn't
at
always
the
only
place
they
can
find
it
,
faith
should
be
accessible
to
any
and
all
who
seek
it
out
.
No
exceptions
.
So
to
LGBTQ
faith
leaders
and
allies
,
keep
listening
,
learning
and
living
out
values
of
love
and
acceptance
.
And
to
all
LGBTQ
people
,
no
matter
your
relationship
with
faith
you
are
seen
and
you
are
loved
.

or
other
pertaining
to
the
unfortunate
state
of
the
Democratic
primary
.
Quinn’s
letter
,
which
I
encourage
all
to
read
,
identifies
the
elusive
and
hypocritical
nature
of
the
Board’s
argument
.
I’m
writing
,
however
,
to
highlight
one
line
in
the
piece
that
ought
to
disqualify
the
Board
from
commenting
on
any
election
.
The
Board
rightly
points
out
that
President
Donald
Trump’s
racially
coded
rhetoric
is
the
key
strategy
of
his
campaign
and
an
obstacle
to
any
challenger
,
but
they
claim
that
this
ideology
is
based
in
the
myth
of
the
declining
white
,
working
class
male
.
The
profound
tone
deafness
of
this
comment
likely
results
from
the
vast
overrepresentation
of
wealthy
suburbs
at
Duke
,
and
the
resulting
disinterest
in
rural
often
meaning
white
issues
.
From
the
vantage
points
of
Alpharetta
or
Orange
County
or
Weston
or
Greenwich
,
where
white
people
tend
to
make
it
out
all
right
,
I
imagine
it
would
really
seem
that
poverty
is
only
a
black
and
brown
problem
,
and
that
white
conservatives
are
primarily
well
endowed
,
self
deceiving
racists
.
But
spend
a
few
days
at
the
home
of
one
of
Duke’s
handful
of
rural
students
,
or
drive
50
miles
outside
any
Southern
or
Midwestern
city
,
and
the
poverty
you’ll
see
is
nondiscriminatory
.
Think
about
the
yearly
drive
to
Beach
Week
,
through
rural
North
and
South
Carolina
.
Every
year
,
I
hear
people
at
Myrtle
joke
gleefully
about
the
junky
and
destitute
towns
along
the
way
.
Yet
some
sort
of
disconnect
perhaps
the
unsightly
Confederate
flags
and
HELL
IS
REAL
billboards
prevents
people
from
truly
seeing
the
clear
evidence
of
white
poverty
and
government
failure
dotting
the
route
to
the
beach
.
I’m
here
to
tell
you
that
there
is
no
myth
,
that
the
decline
of
every
part
of
the
working
class
is
quite
real
,
politically
explosive
,
and
only
getting
worse
as
incomes
decline
,
costs
of
living
rise
,
and
an
insidious
insecurity
sets
in
among
blue
collar
Americans
.
I
believe
that
Duke
students’
hearts
are
usually
in
the
right
place
.
But
having
grown
up
in
small
town
Kentucky
,
amid
the
heroin
crisis
,
declining
education
funding
,
vanishing
state
pensions
,
and
the
last
gasp
of
the
once
mighty
coal
industry
,
it
hurts
me
deeply
to
see
the
daily
struggles
of
friends
and
family
members
ignored
and
relegated
to
the
status
of
a
racist
myth
.
The
Board
fails
to
see
that
the
real
myth
is
not
the
decline
of
the
so
called
white
working
class
;
it’s
the
Right’s
insistence
that
this
decline
is
due
to
immigrants
,
climate
protection
,
and
taxes
on
the
rich
.
Democratic
candidates
should
not
be
scolded
for
reaching
out
to
voters
,
including
many
of
my
high
school
classmates
,
who
are
consistently
ignored
by
the
left
and
deceived
by
the
right
.
By
doubling
down
on
progressive
purity
tests
and
poking
fun
at
candidates
like
O’Rourke
or
Biden
or
Booker
or
Klobuchar
who
preach
unity
,
the
Editorial
Board
is
choosing
to
learn
nothing
from
the
2016
election
,
the
basket
of
deplorables
fiasco
,
and
the
Clinton
campaign’s
colossal
failure
in
the
Midwest
.
It
is
also
unintentionally
showcasing
its
privilege
.
It’s
incontestable
that
poverty
is
tied
to
race
in
America
,
but
to
think
,
as
do
the
Board
and
many
other
progressives
at
Duke
,
of
inequality
in
a
purely
abstract
sense
as
an
academic
metaphor
for
generations
of
racism
rather
than
a
policy
mediated
calamity
affecting
the
most
vulnerable
among
every
identity
is
privilege
incarnate
.
The
decline
of
the
working
class
,
white
or
otherwise
,
puts
real
lives
at
risk
and
poses
an
existential
threat
to
democracy
,
as
the
past
few
turbulent
years
have
shown
us
.
Talk
of
a
myth
of
the
decline
of
the
white
working
class
frequently
comes
from
the
same
mouths
that
lament
rising
inequality
,
environmental
injustice
,
and
weak
education
funding
.
This
is
all
but
an
acknowledgement
that
for
elite
college
students
,
and
certainly
for
the
Editorial
Board
,
some
people’s
problems
matter
more
than
others’
.
I
can
only
hope
that
the
next
time
the
Editorial
Board
considers
the
2020
election
,
their
attitude
toward
the
crisis
of
the
working
class
will
be
less
cavalier
.
But
I’m
not
counting
on
it
.
The
good
people
of
the
editorial
section
told
me
I
could
have
800
words
to
talk
about
my
Duke
Chronicle
experience
in
no
uncertain
terms
.
800
is
a
weird
number
.
It
enables
one
to
say
both
a
little
and
a
lot
.
Well
,
I
guess
I’m
down
to
751
now
.
I
joined
the
sports
staff
on
the
Chronicle
in
part
because
of
sheer
serendipity
.
My
R
.
A
.
was
the
blog
editor
and
after
we
spent
some
time
talking
sports
together
,
he
encouraged
me
to
come
out
and
write
about
them
.
I
only
thought
about
writing
at
all
after
spending
the
entirety
of
my
senior
year
of
high
school
on
Grantland
,
learning
what
it’s
like
not
just
to
report
on
sports
but
to
take
genuine
joy
in
describing
the
meaning
in
fandom
,
athletic
marvels
and
culture
.
I’d
be
lying
if
I
said
that
the
2015
NCAA
title
wasn’t
a
factor
in
my
decision
to
come
to
Duke
in
the
first
place
.
I’m
certainly
not
saying
anything
new
when
I
say
that
sports
are
the
ultimate
distractor
.
When
life
gets
tough
or
overwhelming
,
the
tribalism
associated
with
watching
a
6’7
19
year
old
jump
48
inches
to
put
an
orange
ball
in
a
10
foot
hoop
is
enough
to
help
forget
even
the
most
onerous
issue
.
So
by
some
stroke
of
luck
,
I
had
someone
encouraging
me
to
write
,
a
writing
style
I
came
to
love
and
the
perfect
outlet
to
talk
about
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
bits
of
culture
that
any
student
at
any
school
could
hope
to
write
about
and
that
culture
extends
far
beyond
basketball
.
I’ve
had
the
opportunity
to
cover
almost
every
sport
Duke
competes
in
,
from
football
games
in
hurricanes
,
to
sunsets
in
downtown
Durham
for
baseball’s
opening
night
and
an
electric
Cameron
Indoor
Stadium
following
an
ACC
win
.
That
said
,
I’ve
had
a
soft
spot
for
one
sport
in
particular
.
I
started
playing
lacrosse
late
in
my
high
school
career
and
instantly
fell
in
love
with
it
.
For
the
last
four
and
half
years
,
the
opportunity
to
go
run
around
,
be
part
of
a
team
and
maybe
even
win
a
game
has
been
the
panacea
for
everything
I
do
.
My
luck
struck
again
when
I
came
to
a
university
with
one
of
the
best
lacrosse
programs
in
the
country
.
The
opportunity
to
see
the
game
I
love
played
at
the
highest
level
and
have
its
legendary
coaches
and
players
acknowledge
me
as
someone
who
knows
the
sport
has
been
extraordinary
.
I’ve
been
lucky
to
be
in
a
position
to
help
grow
the
game
in
my
own
way
and
equally
lucky
to
see
ACC
Tournaments
,
rivalry
games
,
iconic
performances
,
record
breaking
goals
and
a
national
runner
up
season
.
Sitting
up
there
in
the
press
box
at
Gillette
Stadium
,
having
driven
three
hours
from
home
to
see
the
most
important
annual
event
for
the
sport
of
lacrosse
,
every
moment
spent
writing
stories
,
tracking
facts
,
editing
,
or
standing
outside
locker
rooms
in
frigid
February
weather
was
worth
it
.
I
thank
John
Danowski
for
the
small
nuggets
of
wisdom
he
would
pass
on
off
the
record
,
just
asking
about
my
life
or
high
school
lacrosse
.
But
none
of
those
grueling
and
rewarding
moments
would
have
been
possible
if
I
wasn’t
lucky
enough
to
be
part
of
another
incredible
team
for
four
years
.
I’ve
learned
more
about
professionalism
,
responsibility
,
collaboration
and
proactivity
from
my
time
on
the
Chronicle
staff
than
anywhere
else
in
my
Duke
career
.
It
helps
to
have
great
editors
like
Amrith
Ramkumar
,
Ryan
Hoerger
and
Brian
Pollack
,
who
taught
me
all
about
being
a
committed
and
efficient
writer
.
I
have
Sameer
Pandhare
,
the
aforementioned
R
.
A
.
who
got
me
on
staff
in
the
first
place
,
to
thank
for
teaching
me
how
to
turn
dry
story
meetings
into
impromptu
roasts
or
comedy
routines
.
Above
all
,
I’ll
miss
Thursday
night
production
when
the
paper
printed
on
Fridays
,
watching
basketball
,
Thursday
Night
Football
or
finishing
the
next
day’s
crossword
with
Hank
Tucker
and
Mitchell
Gladstone
,
my
classmates
.
I’ll
miss
heading
up
to
301
Flowers
every
week
at
10
p
.
m
.
only
to
leave
at
1
a
.
m
.
,
the
Chapel
lit
up
behind
me
,
glowing
its
confirmation
of
a
job
well
done
.
I’ve
been
blessed
to
collect
the
bylines
that
I
have
,
and
though
just
about
anyone
do
what
I’ve
done
since
a
rainy
Friday
meeting
in
2015
,
it’s
been
uncommon
for
most
people
to
stick
with
it
.
Even
I
have
seen
my
play
slip
a
little
from
time
to
time
,
but
as
I’ve
come
to
find
over
all
my
time
at
Duke
,
the
most
important
thing
is
showing
up
.
Not
every
endeavor
leads
to
success
,
but
as
long
as
there’s
an
effort
to
show
up
and
work
hard
,
as
every
person
writing
a
column
like
this
has
,
you
just
get
more
chances
to
get
lucky
.
Most
20
somes
don’t
have
the
chance
to
choose
where
they
work
.
For
many
college
students
,
the
job
hunt
is
littered
with
rejections
of
I’m
sorry
and
promises
to
keep
in
touch
.
And
although
I’ve
been
lucky
enough
to
spend
my
last
two
summers
in
Philadelphia
,
my
favorite
office
is
here
in
Durham
.
Growing
up
,
first
in
Charlotte
and
then
Philly
,
I
never
missed
a
Duke
basketball
game
.
After
the
Blue
Devils
won
their
third
national
title
in
2001
,
watching
hoops
alongside
my
dad
was
the
routine
in
our
house
.
I
even
got
to
see
a
couple
of
games
in
person
,
but
none
at
Cameron
Indoor
.
I
remember
opening
my
family’s
old
red
jewelry
box
during
Hanukkah
2007
and
seeing
those
two
tickets
for
a
game
at
what
I
will
always
consider
the
best
venue
in
all
of
basketball
,
I
flipped
out
.
Duke
beat
Virginia
87
65
,
but
the
score
didn’t
matter
.
I
was
inside
Cameron
.
Little
did
I
know
,
less
than
eight
years
later
,
that
would
be
the
place
where
I
got
to
go
to
work
.
Being
a
trombonist
in
the
pep
band
and
a
men’s
basketball
beat
writer
,
I
got
plenty
of
perks
.
I
never
slept
a
night
in
a
tent
,
I
never
waited
in
line
for
a
game
unless
I
chose
to
and
I
didn’t
have
to
cram
into
a
crowded
Section
17
.
But
I
also
always
had
a
job
to
do
.
As
a
band
member
,
I
had
to
,
for
one
,
make
sure
I
didn’t
stick
out
like
the
mediocre
instrumentalist
I’ve
always
been
.
More
importantly
,
though
,
myself
and
the
bones
had
the
task
of
ensuring
a
safe
trip
across
Coach
K
Court
for
the
Blue
Devil
a
task
that
,
each
time
,
inevitably
led
to
someone
else
figuring
out
that
I
was
in
the
band
.
Of
course
,
my
other
role
involved
sneaking
through
the
front
row
of
painted
bodies
in
the
student
section
to
my
seat
on
press
row
.
From
center
court
,
I
wrote
stories
and
sent
out
tweets
,
all
while
managing
to
never
have
my
laptop
destroyed
by
a
ball
or
player
diving
into
the
stands
.
Basically
,
all
of
what
I
did
was
outside
the
lines
that
separate
the
4
,
700
square
feet
of
hardwood
from
the
rest
of
the
building
.
But
I
was
in
that
building
,
a
gym
unlike
any
other
partially
because
of
what
it
means
to
me
and
partially
because
of
all
the
moments
that
have
happened
in
there
.
I’m
lucky
.
Both
The
Chronicle
and
band
have
taken
me
places
I
probably
wouldn’t
have
ventured
to
otherwise
.
As
a
freshman
,
I
traveled
south
to
Miami
,
only
to
write
about
women’s
basketball
missing
25
straight
shots
in
a
loss
.
Later
that
year
,
the
band
took
me
2
,
220
miles
west
to
Anaheim
,
and
that
didn’t
go
much
better
for
the
men
on
the
hardwood
.
Maybe
I
just
wasn’t
the
good
luck
charm
.
I
covered
men’s
basketball’s
buzzer
beating
loss
in
the
Carrier
Dome
as
a
sophomore
,
going
north
to
Syracuse
,
N
.
Y
.
,
and
as
a
junior
,
I
made
my
way
to
Omaha
,
Neb
.
,
only
to
write
about
Grayson
Allen’s
final
game
at
Duke
.
And
this
year
,
the
band
brought
me
to
Washington
,
D
.
C
.
,
where
the
Blue
Devils’
season
and
my
two
jobs
came
to
an
end
,
at
least
for
now
.
Be
it
in
Louisville
or
Pittsburgh
,
Charlottesville
or
Clemson
,
I
got
to
work
in
environments
that
some
might
pay
hundreds
of
dollars
to
experience
.
And
yet
,
none
of
them
were
the
same
as
the
one
that
was
a
little
more
than
1
,
000
feet
from
my
room
.

Cameron
Indoor
Stadium
is
a
different
animal
.
I
never
wondered
whether
all
9
,
314
seats
would
be
filled
on
a
given
night
.
The
answer
was
always
yes
.
When
I
looked
up
to
the
rafters
,
I
saw
the
memories
from
my
childhood
wearing
my
black
JJ
Redick
jersey
in
my
driveway
,
only
shooting
from
beyond
my
chalk
drawn
3
point
arc
,
or
sitting
on
the
edge
of
my
seat
during
the
final
minute
of
the
2010
title
game
,
before
running
in
circles
around
my
dad’s
apartment
after
Gordon
Hayward’s
half
court
try
bounced
off
the
rim
.
From
the
time
the
North
entrance
opens
90
minutes
prior
to
tip
until
about
an
hour
afterwards
,
when
most
everyone
has
cleared
out
,
Cameron
is
just
like
you
see
on
TV
.
It’s
loud
.
It’s
crammed
.
It’s
crazy
.
But
I’ll
always
cherish
my
time
in
Cameron
when
it
is
empty
,
when
you
can
hear
a
ball
bounce
or
maybe
even
the
keys
of
a
laptop
being
tapped
.
I
doubt
I’ll
ever
have
another
office
like
Cameron
Indoor
Stadium
.
And
if
I
do
,
let’s
just
hope
I
don’t
find
a
way
to
break
my
foot
in
there
,
too
.
Imagine
if
during
Orientation
Week
,
you
were
guaranteed
your
dream
job
or
top
graduate
school
program
upon
graduation
.
Duke
would
no
longer
be
seen
as
a
stepping
stone
for
the
future
.
Instead
,
every
student
would
have
the
opportunity
to
make
their
Duke
experience
what
they
really
desired
.
How
do
you
think
your
four
years
as
a
Blue
Devil
would
differ
as
a
result
?
Now
that
bookbagging
for
next
semester’s
courses
has
begun
,
many
of
us
are
thinking
about
completing
major
and
university
requirements
while
filling
the
remainder
of
our
schedules
with
easy
As
.
Though
,
if
you
didn’t
have
to
worry
about
T
Recs
and
didn’t
feel
the
need
to
boost
your
grade
,
your
approach
to
course
selection
might
change
.
Throughout
my
years
at
Duke
,
I
have
sought
to
take
courses
in
which
I
am
genuinely
interested
and
let
everything
else
fall
into
place
.
I’ve
been
very
satisfied
with
this
outlook
,
as
it
has
enabled
me
to
learn
about
history
,
public
policy
,
and
Jewish
Studies
while
being
an
environmental
science
amp
;
policy
major
with
an
economics
minor
and
innovation
amp
;
entrepreneurship
certificate
.
But
if
grades
weren't
of
the
same
level
of
concern
as
they
are
now
,
maybe
I
would
venture
into
fields
that
are
farther
off
from
my
path
such
as
computer
science
and
engineering
.
These
STEM
skills
would
surely
be
beneficial
.
Once
enrolled
in
the
courses
you
truly
want
to
be
taking
,
consider
how
your
class
experience
may
shift
.
You
wouldn’t
have
the
desire
to
check
the
time
,
scroll
through
Instagram
,
or
complete
the
next
homework
assignment
during
the
lecture
.
Instead
,
you
would
be
motivated
to
focus
on
the
material
.
Questions
would
be
about
interesting
hypotheticals
and
real
life
applications
instead
of
will
this
be
on
the
test
?
or
can
you
go
back
to
the
previous
slide
because
I
didn’t
finish
writing
the
last
bullet
point
?
I’m
currently
in
my
favorite
class
I’ve
ever
taken
at
Duke
Candidacy
to
Congress
Campaigns
,
Policies
,
and
Politics
.
There
was
one
assignment
I
spent
nearly
40
hours
completing
,
not
because
I
had
to
,
but
because
I
wanted
to
.
With
classes
like
this
,
late
nights
in
Perkins
are
because
you
didn’t
want
to
stop
working
on
an
assignment
rather
than
starting
late
because
of
procrastination
.
With
your
academics
no
longer
revolving
around
grades
,
co
curricular
experience
would
be
considered
just
as
valuable
as
classwork
.
Duke
offers
an
incredible
array
of
seminars
,
speaker
series
and
networking
opportunities
.
However
,
it’s
easy
to
get
caught
up
in
studying
for
a
midterm
or
exhausted
from
a
long
day
of
classes
that
these
programs
sometimes
fall
by
the
wayside
.
Yet
,
the
education
we
receive
outside
of
the
classroom
can
be
even
more
impactful
than
that
which
takes
place
inside
the
classroom
.
Over
a
span
of
just
two
months
,
three
former
government
officials
U
.
S
.
Secretary
of
State
Madeleine
Albright
,
presidential
chief
of
staff
John
Kelly
,
and
acting
FBI
Director
Andrew
McCabe
will
have
given
talks
on
our
campus
,
not
to
mention
well
renowned
entrepreneurs
and
advocates
.
Attending
these
types
of
events
could
become
the
rule
instead
of
the
exception
.
Most
appealing
of
all
,
you
could
manage
your
schedule
how
you
really
want
to
.
Spending
time
with
friends
,
participating
in
fun
activities
and
going
out
wouldn’t
be
contingent
on
having
crammed
the
entire
preceding
week
.
Instead
,
you
could
decide
when
to
have
fun
.
You
would
not
dread
returning
to
your
work
.
Your
stress
level
would
significantly
drop
once
you
knew
you
could
handle
everything
on
your
plate
.
All
of
these
changes
have
been
predicated
on
being
assured
of
post
graduation
plans
.
However
,
they
don’t
have
to
be
.
Choosing
interesting
classes
,
eagerly
engaging
with
the
material
,
participating
in
exciting
programs
,
and
striking
a
better
work
life
balance
are
all
within
our
capacity
as
students
.
It
just
requires
a
change
in
thinking
.
It
comes
down
to
a
very
simple
question
that
is
incredibly
difficult
for
us
to
answer
why
are
we
here
?
I
believe
many
students
see
Duke
as
a
vehicle
to
reach
what
is
to
come
after
graduation
.
Whether
they
are
planning
to
obtain
further
education
or
enter
the
workforce
,
the
focus
is
on
leveraging
the
Duke
brand
and
diploma
to
fulfill
these
goals
.
Getting
accepted
to
top
graduate
schools
and
employment
opportunities
is
very
difficult
,
thus
it
makes
sense
that
students
want
to
do
everything
they
can
while
at
Duke
to
make
these
distinguished
achievements
their
reality
.
Nonetheless
,
this
approach
misses
out
on
what
I
believe
college
is
all
about
academic
and
personal
growth
.
In
order
for
this
to
occur
,
we
can’t
simply
check
off
the
boxes
of
an
undergraduate
education
.
We
have
to
follow
our
passions
while
going
outside
of
our
comfort
zone
.
We
need
to
have
meaningful
experiences
,
both
inside
and
outside
of
the
classroom
.
We
should
set
aside
time
to
participate
in
the
unique
opportunities
that
only
Duke
can
provide
.
The
famous
writer
Mark
Twain
once
said
don’t
let
schooling
interfere
with
your
education
.
It
might
not
be
possible
to
be
assured
what
life
after
Duke
will
look
like
for
each
of
us
,
but
I
still
believe
we
would
all
benefit
greatly
by
heeding
this
advice
.
I’ve
recently
been
the
unwilling
participant
in
a
not
so
mysterious
game
against
myself
.
The
game
,
which
has
lasted
a
few
weeks
now
,
is
simple
at
every
moment
I
am
equally
as
likely
to
sob
as
I
am
to
emit
a
loud
cross
between
a
chuckle
and
a
cackle
.
The
bit
is
that
I
don’t
know
which
one
will
emerge
in
any
given
moment
,
a
dash
of
anxious
spontaneity
I
never
asked
for
but
experience
nonetheless
.
And
,
sadly
,
there’s
no
prize
at
the
end
only
the
unavoidable
pity
in
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
observing
my
face
which
looks
something
like
the
image
above
in
Pitchforks
.
If
one
wanted
to
psychoanalyze
me
,
they
could
point
out
the
pressures
of
classes
or
relationships
collapsing
in
on
me
,
and
classify
my
game
metaphor
as
a
useful
distraction
from
actually
unpacking
and
addressing
my
own
issues
.
On
the
other
hand
,
pursuing
such
deep
introspection
sounds
like
hard
work
.
Thus
,
when
I
walked
into
Mad
Hatter’s
last
Thursday
to
catch
up
with
a
former
professor
,
I
remained
in
the
thick
of
my
game
like
fantasy
,
desperately
worried
my
ugly
crying
face
would
emerge
and
she’d
be
forced
to
witness
it
.
Imagine
my
surprise
,
then
,
when
within
moments
of
us
sitting
down
to
talk
,
everything
fears
,
anxieties
and
a
few
droplets
of
saliva
spilled
onto
the
table
.
I
talked
about
second
guessing
my
decisions
in
planning
an
event
,
my
complicated
study
abroad
feelings
,
and
the
insecurities
I
felt
in
my
friendships
.
The
emotional
balancing
act
that
had
dominated
my
daily
life
for
weeks
slowly
dissolved
as
she
held
space
for
me
to
blather
,
rant
and
process
.
She
didn’t
let
me
off
the
hook
,
though
she
probed
,
asked
difficult
questions
,
provided
support
and
affirmation
.
When
we
finished
and
walked
out
of
Mad
Hatter’s
,
I
felt
relieved
leaving
that
frothy
mixture
of
saliva
and
insecurity
behind
.
I
could
not
have
survived
some
of
my
most
difficult
moments
at
Duke
without
mentors
like
this
professor
mentors
who
were
willing
to
critique
,
validate
and
offer
their
own
versions
of
dealing
with
self
created
game
show
metaphors
.
I
remember
my
first
year
,
for
instance
,
drinking
coffee
on
a
plaza
outside
Perkins
with
someone
older
than
me
,
a
person
who
would
become
both
a
friend
and
mentor
,
as
I
told
them
about
my
ill
conceived
project
idea
around
workers’
rights
at
Duke
.
They
would
have
been
entirely
justified
in
leaving
me
at
that
table
without
a
word
and
never
speaking
to
me
again
.
Instead
,
miraculously
,
they
stayed
and
offered
gentle
yet
critical
feedback
,
shared
a
brief
history
of
labor
activism
at
this
University
,
and
left
me
with
the
entirely
sensible
advice
to
read
one
,
two
or
maybe
ten
more
articles
before
trying
out
a
new
idea
.
While
first
year
me
was
probably
a
little
stunned
,
I
think
we
are
all
grateful
to
this
friend
that
they
checked
me
early
.
Over
time
,
I
realized
I
was
incredibly
lucky
and
thoroughly
undeserving
of
the
mentors
in
my
life
my
parents
,
friends
,
professors
,
activists
.
My
appreciation
for
them
grew
because
without
their
care
and
guidance
I
wouldn’t
have
figured
out
that
my
true
love
was
history
,
not
public
policy
,
that
I
could
participate
in
meaningful
anti
poverty
work
in
my
local
community
,
or
that
attending
CAPS
was
a
necessary
step
for
me
to
take
.
They
provided
examples
of
moral
courage
,
humility
and
how
to
be
not
completely
cynical
about
Duke
or
the
world
.
Without
them
I
could
not
be
here
both
literally
at
my
computer
and
in
a
grand
spiritual
sense
,
and
there
is
no
way
I
can
adequately
repay
them
.
Nonetheless
,
I
know
I
must
somehow
attempt
to
make
good
on
the
love
they
showed
me
.
I
believe
we
are
each
responsible
,
in
our
own
ways
,
for
pouring
whatever
love
,
knowledge
or
support
we’ve
been
given
into
those
who
come
after
us
,
whether
it’s
a
sibling
,
a
first
year
in
your
SLG
,
or
it’s
through
a
program
you
create
that
will
benefit
Duke
students
long
after
you
leave
this
campus
.
It’s
a
type
of
mentorship
and
community
building
that
goes
beyond
mere
networking
but
rather
a
commitment
to
building
relationships
that
make
surviving
this
University
a
little
bit
easier
.
If
done
well
,
these
relationships
aren’t
just
a
one
way
exchange
but
reciprocal
,
a
place
to
be
vulnerable
and
collectively
sharpen
one’s
thoughts
and
beliefs
.
A
shared
,
meaningful
relationship
requires
that
both
mentor
and
mentee
recognize
that
they
can
learn
from
each
other
that
gaps
in
age
or
knowledge
don’t
necessarily
weaken
the
validity
of
one’s
insight
or
analysis
.
The
mentors
I’ve
admired
most
,
and
in
turn
the
relationships
I
treasured
most
,
respected
me
as
much
as
I
respected
them
.
nbsp
;
nbsp
;
nbsp
;
This
is
the
charge
I’ll
attempt
to
carry
with
me
in
my
last
year
at
Duke
.
The
mentorship
I
received
has
left
me
determined
to
muster
the
resources
and
knowledge
I
do
have
and
pass
them
on
a
position
I
never
imagined
I’d
be
in
when
I
first
stumbled
onto
campus
.
I’ll
share
the
classes
I
loved
and
hated
,
the
stories
of
brilliant
students
,
workers
and
community
members
who
held
Duke
accountable
,
and
the
absolutely
crucial
advice
to
immediately
become
friends
with
Duke’s
librarians
.
I’ll
try
to
listen
,
refrain
from
making
dad
jokes
,
and
be
there
for
performances
,
rallies
or
the
Gardens
on
warm
Sunday
afternoons
.
I
don’t
imagine
I’ll
always
do
it
as
well
as
my
former
professor
did
for
me
last
Thursday
.
Frequently
,
in
fact
,
I
make
situations
worse
.
But
,
at
the
very
least
,
I
know
I
can
always
commit
to
keep
learning
and
showing
up
.
The
Chronicle
along
with
The
New
York
Times
and
other
major
news
outlets
,
has
reported
on
the
United
Methodist
Church
UMC
’s
vote
during
a
February
26th
special
session
of
the
General
Conference
to
tighten
its
ban
on
LGBTQ
clergy
and
same
gender
marriage
.
This
controversial
decision
deepened
the
rift
between
its
progressive
and
conservative
leaders
and
12
.
5
million
members
worldwide
and
increased
the
possibility
of
a
historic
split
.
There
are
also
implications
for
UMC
affiliated
universities
like
Duke
.
On
January
5th
,
in
anticipation
of
the
upcoming
General
Conference
vote
,
Duke
and
92
other
UMC
affiliated
colleges
and
universities
,
unanimously
approved
a
joint
statement
citing
the
Church’s
historic
and
profound
commitment
to
the
sacred
worth
of
all
persons
and
to
social
justice
,
such
as
the
Church’s
position
on
civil
rights
,
women’s
rights
,
and
the
rights
of
different
ethnic
communities
and
calling
upon
UMC
leaders
to
honor
the
past
and
current
practices
of
inclusion
by
amending
their
policies
and
practices
to
affirm
full
inclusion
in
the
life
and
ministry
of
the
United
Methodist
Church
of
all
persons
regardless
of
their
race
,
ethnicity
,
creed
,
national
origin
,
gender
,
gender
identity
expression
or
sexual
orientation
.
Michael
Schoenfeld
,
vice
president
for
public
affairs
and
government
relations
,
said
the
statement
is
consistent
with
Duke’s
longstanding
commitment
to
diversity
and
inclusion
.
At
the
UMC
General
Conference
,
the
majority
of
Church
leaders
doubled
down
on
their
discriminatory
practices
by
reaffirming
the
Book
of
Discipline
which
bars
self
avowed
practicing
homosexuals
from
being
ordained
as
ministers
and
forbids
pastors
from
conducting
same
gender
marriage
.
They
even
voted
to
enhance
punitive
actions
against
clergy
and
employees
who
violate
the
policy
by
refusing
to
discriminate
.
In
his
February
26th
statement
about
the
UMC’s
decision
,
Dean
Jones
opened
with
sighs
too
deep
for
words
and
asserted
that
we
will
work
to
ensure
that
all
are
welcome
to
pursue
study
and
preparation
for
Christian
ministry
at
Duke
Divinity
School
.
However
,
he
conceded
that
Duke
Divinity
School
receives
significant
financial
support
from
and
is
accountable
to
the
denomination
in
the
preparation
of
United
Methodist
women
and
men
for
ministry
and
that
the
school
will
continue
to
seek
to
create
a
community
where
people
committed
to
Christian
ministry
emphasis
added
.
The
LGBTQ
community
is
entitled
to
far
more
than
sighs
too
deep
for
words
and
prayers
for
wisdom
and
charity
.
Disagreement
is
a
far
cry
from
institutionalized
discrimination
,
and
while
you
are
sighing
,
we
are
dying
.
We
recall
the
ACT
UP
motto
SILENCE
DEATH
in
response
to
the
United
States
and
other
governments’
initial
inattention
to
the
AIDS
pandemic
,
which
resulted
in
millions
of
lives
lost
.
We
remind
Duke
and
other
university
leaders
that
allowing
institutionalized
discrimination
against
LGBTQ
people
to
continue
unchecked
creates
an
environment
conducive
to
harassment
and
violence
that
will
result
in
more
suffering
and
lives
lost
and
is
in
direct
violation
of
your
own
institutions’
Equal
Opportunity
Affirmative
Action
and
Diversity
and
Equity
policies
and
programs
and
the
Universal
Declaration
of
Human
Rights
.
We
look
to
Duke
to
take
a
leadership
role
alongside
the
92
other
UMC
affiliated
colleges
and
universities
and
take
a
strong
and
unequivocal
stance
against
the
institutionalized
discrimination
being
carried
out
by
the
Church
.
Duke’s
UMC
affiliation
and
renowned
divinity
school
place
it
squarely
and
visibly
in
the
middle
of
this
conflict
,
and
its
international
reputation
among
higher
education
institutions
gives
it
the
stature
to
take
an
influential
leadership
stance
.
Duke
was
named
in
The
New
York
Times
front
page
article
about
the
UMC’s
recent
vote
and
has
been
named
by
other
major
news
outlets
.
Duke’s
clout
is
unquestionable
,
and
so
its
leadership
can
be
meaningful
.
It
has
an
effective
bully
pulpit
;
the
phrase
was
never
more
apt
.
Duke
has
historically
displayed
courageous
leadership
in
this
area
and
enhanced
its
reputation
by
doing
so
.
As
Chapel
Dean
,
Bishop
Will
Willimon
opened
the
Duke
Chapel
to
same
gender
ceremonies
well
in
advance
of
marriage
equality
laws
,
which
allowed
Duke
to
show
moral
leadership
and
institutional
integrity
by
advancing
the
righteous
cause
of
LGBTQ
equality
on
campus
and
nationally
.
There
is
an
undeniable
conflict
between
Duke’s
anti
discrimination
policies
and
the
institutionalized
discrimination
being
practiced
by
the
UMC
.
This
dissonance
cannot
endure
for
long
without
having
a
corrosive
effect
on
the
sincerity
of
Duke’s
publicly
stated
commitment
to
diversity
,
inclusion
,
and
belonging
for
all
,
including
LGBTQ
people
.
Without
decisive
leadership
,
Duke’s
moral
authority
,
strongly
exercised
to
good
effect
in
the
past
,
will
become
an
example
of
hypocrisy
and
abandoned
leadership
,
undermine
its
history
of
admirable
action
,
and
cast
a
long
shadow
on
Duke’s
reputation
.
Duke
must
either
publicly
and
energetically
lead
action
that
ends
the
discrimination
,
or
it
must
break
ties
with

It’s
a
question
that
I
have
grappled
with
every
day
during
my
three
years
writing
for
The
Chronicle
.
Of
course
,
on
the
surface
level
,
the
answer
should
be
clear
.
nbsp
;
As
summed
up
on
the
editorial
board’s
FAQ
page
we
write
consensus
based
,
unsigned
editorials
on
a
variety
of
issues
on
behalf
of
the
greater
body
of
The
Chronicle
.
Editorial
board
is
independent
of
the
news
making
body
of
the
newspaper
,
and
among
friends
,
readers
,
and
Chronicle
peers
,
and
my
geriatric
rant
about
confusion
between
departments
on
the
part
of
readership
,
I
guess
I
should
talk
about
what
editorial
board
has
meant
for
me
personally
.
I
arrived
on
West
Campus
in
the
Fall
of
2016
feeling
somewhat
isolated
and
disconnected
from
the
rest
of
Duke
.
Most
of
the
people
who
lived
in
my
freshman
hall
rushed
I
ended
up
going
random
for
housing
my
sophomore
year
and
I
didn’t
really
join
any
campus
organizations
my
freshman
year
.
During
weekend
nights
,
I
mostly
would
sit
on
my
bed
watching
old
movies
on
my
laptop
while
sipping
cheap
soju
from
the
bottle
.
For
my
sophomore
year
,
I
ended
up
having
the
same
RA
as
I
had
in
Blackwell
,
Lenny
.
Lenny
actually
served
as
the
chair
of
the
editorial
board
my
freshman
year
,
and
encouraged
me
to
apply
.
As
is
my
style
,
I’m
pretty
sure
I
butchered
my
interview
with
the
editorial
board
,
but
sure
enough
got
on
.
There
was
the
usual
baptism
of
fire
,
having
to
back
up
my
half
formed
opinions
to
a
group
of
well
versed
students
,
and
receiving
back
heavily
edited
drafts
of
poorly
written
editorials
on
my
part
.
Pretty
soon
,
I
was
signing
up
to
write
every
week
,
and
looking
forward
to
Sunday
afternoon
and
Tuesday
night
editorial
board
meetings
,
as
if
they
were
the
only
times
I
could
express
my
opinions
on
the
various
happenings
of
campus
life
.
Editorial
board
became
that
niche
I
was
looking
for
at
Duke
,
something
I
could
commit
myself
to
while
navigating
a
campus
that
I
still
very
much
felt
alienated
from
.
As
an
introverted
person
of
color
,
it
became
a
safe
space
where
I
could
air
my
frustrations
and
concerns
at
an
institution
that
is
still
very
much
culturally
and
ideologically
white
despite
maintaining
a
level
of
superficial
diversity
.
Over
200
editorials
later
,
my
time
at
The
Chronicle
has
come
to
an
end
with
this
parting
senior
column
,
and
with
it
,
a
four
year
experience
filled
with
ups
and
downs
.
Yet
,
amidst
it
all
,
editorial
board
was
one
of
the
few
stable
places
in
my
Duke
experience
.
If
edit
board
continues
to
exist
as
a
department
in
the
future
which
is
debatable
,
considering
the
discomfort
a
group
of
opinionated
students
can
present
to
certain
readers
on
campus
,
readers
and
Chronicle
staff
will
inevitably
keep
asking
What
is
edit
board
?
Answers
will
differ
,
but
at
least
that
means
people
are
still
reading
.
As
college
admissions
season
draws
to
a
close
,
with
pomp
and
circumstance
,
Duke
announced
last
week
that
the
regular
decision
acceptance
rate
for
the
Class
of
2023
had
dropped
to
a
mere
5
.
7
percent
.
This
is
a
record
low
,
dropping
just
under
a
percentage
from
last
year’s
record
low
of
6
.
4
percent
.
Members
of
next
year’s
incoming
first
year
class
undoubtedly
had
to
stand
out
from
an
incredibly
competitive
pool
to
gain
admission
and
should
be
proud
for
having
done
so
.
But
,
beyond
this
astronomically
low
statistic
,
what
does
it
really
mean
for
Duke’s
acceptance
rate
to
have
plummeted
to
7
percent
?
A
0
.
7
percent
decrease
may
seem
slight
to
some
,
but
this
decrease
represents
an
ongoing
trend
in
college
admissions
.
Duke’s
acceptance
rate
in
2009
was
17
percent
,
which
at
the
time
was
touted
as
the
lowest
in
Duke’s
history
by
the
perennial
Dean
Christoph
Guttentag
.
In
just
10
years
,
Duke’s
already
unreachable
,
pseudo
ivied
gates
have
closed
on
a
further
10
percent
fewer
students
.
This
record
low
was
especially
acute
in
the
regular
decision
pool
,
which
can
already
feel
like
a
self
doubt
inducing
lottery
in
an
age
of
sub
10
percent
acceptance
rates
.
Though
Duke
does
publish
some
vague
semblance
of
admissions
guidelines
,
to
determine
whether
you
have
met
those
is
guesswork
at
best
.
This
mystique
is
only
furthered
by
the
elusive
gatekeepers
to
Duke
the
admission
officers
.
Tasked
with
creating
the
next
class
of
smart
,
diverse
and
well
behaved
Duke
students
,
implicit
biases
may
play
a
part
in
choosing
whether
to
accept
the
straight
A
lacrosse
star
over
the
Math
Olympiad
champion
and
vice
versa
.
The
real
problem
with
the
decreasing
acceptance
rates
is
the
illusion
of
Duke
exceptionalism
that
it
allows
admitted
students
to
peddle
.
Every
year
at
convocation
,
Guttentag
highlights
some
notable
admitted
Duke
students
who
have
decided
to
grace
the
Gothic
Wonderland
with
their
genius
.
From
international
chess
champions
to
semi
professional
ballet
dancers
,
administration
seeks
to
remind
the
incoming
class
how
special
and
uniquely
talented
they
are
for
having
survived
such
a
rigorous
admissions
process
.
In
knowing
that
not
just
anyone
can
claim
the
title
of
Duke
students
,
we
have
sufficient
evidence
to
justify
waving
flags
of
intellectual
elitism
towards
supposedly
lesser
schools
like
UNC
and
Wake
Forest
.
In
reality
,
being
admitted
doesn't
mean
you've
deftly
navigated
the
pitfalls
of
applying
to
a
prestigious
university
.
To
apply
regular
admission
as
a
non
legacy
student
is
something
akin
to
putting
one’s
application
into
a
metaphorical
black
box
,
hoping
to
receive
a
thick
envelope
come
April
.
This
is
not
,
however
,
to
say
that
there
are
not
exceptional
students
at
Duke
.
But
it
is
important
to
acknowledge
that
exceptionalism
in
the
context
of
college
admissions
is
rarely
independent
of
upbringing
,
access
to
resources
and
income
.
Far
too
often
,
this
sense
of
Duke
exceptionalism
,
being
part
of
the
mythical
7
percent
to
have
survived
a
brutal
admissions
process
,
can
lead
to
delusions
of
grandeur
at
an
elite
university
where
students
feel
they
are
entitled
to
internships
at
Goldman
Sachs
and
admission
to
Harvard
Medical
School
.
It
is
not
just
Duke
students
who
look
to
falling
acceptance
rates
in
approval
.
As
an
institution
,
it
seems
that
Duke’s
pride
in
is
its
rising
exclusivity
is
emblematic
of
its
continuous
attempts
to
compete
with
our
older
,
ivied
peers
up
north
.
Having
already
surpassed
a
number
of
elite
schools
in
selectivity
,
the
Southern
Ivy
continually
clamors
to
prove
that
it
is
just
as
prestigious
as
its
peer
institutions
.
How
often
did
you
hear
,
I’m
only
here
because
I
got
waitlisted
from
Princeton
or
I
didn’t
get
into
Yale
during
obligatory
Orientation
Week
introductions
?
Melissa
Harris
Perry
,
the
orientation
week
speaker
for
the
Class
of
2019
,
even
jokingly
inquired
to
a
fledgling
first
year
class
if
anyone
in
the
audience
was
at
Duke
because
they
were
unable
to
get
into
Harvard
.
Self
deprecation
aside
,
it
seems
that
acceptance
rates
among
elite
universities
have
come
to
represent
a
numerical
hat
contest
,
with
a
4
percent
acceptance
rate
somehow
more
more
impressive
than
a
generous
7
percent
.
What
is
the
real
difference
between
the
class
of
2019
and
2023
?
For
the
senior
class
who
arrived
on
campus
four
years
ago
,
the
acceptance
rate
was
11
.
4
percent
.
Now
that
the
number
has
dropped
four
percentage
points
,
is
there
any
less
dramatic
difference
between
the
quality
of
Duke
students
who
rave
at
Devines
or
decide
to
STINF
their
Friday
morning
8
30
?
Probably
not
.
My
phone
vibrates
.
It’s
an
incoming
call
from
my
mom
.
I
pick
up
and
before
she
can
even
say
hi
,
I
whisper
hurriedly
,
advice
or
my
dad
will
forward
me
important
emails
so
I
can
draft
a
reply
for
him
.
The
reality
of
not
just
my
parents’
steadily
increasing
age
but
also
my
own
is
something
that
I
am
still
not
quite
ready
to
confront
.
This
is
a
reflection
on
both
the
passage
of
time
and
the
creation
of
distance
.
Everyone
says
that
college
is
a
period
for
self
discovery
and
growth
,
which
is
true
.
We
gain
independence
and
self
awareness
and
attempt
to
figure
out
our
true
passions
and
goals
,
and
that’s
all
great
but
it’s
impossible
to
do
this
without
first
acknowledging
your
roots
.
Everything
I’ve
done
in
my
life
I
can
credit
in
some
way
to
my
parents
.
And
yet
,
the
things
I
need
to
say
to
them
most
are
also
the
ones
I
never
say
enough
Thank
you
.
I
miss
you
.
I
love
you
.
I’ll
pick
up
the
phone
now
and
tell
them
that
.
Last
Friday
morning
,
I
sat
in
a
room
of
my
non
one
percenter
peers
and
attempted
to
decipher
what
,
exactly
,
was
being
said
to
me
about
the
debt
I
took
on
as
part
of
the
ever
rising
cost
of
a
Duke
education
.
This
is
one
of
the
less
fun
Duke
graduation
requirements
exit
loan
counseling
.
The
presenting
loan
counselor
sped
through
the
different
types
of
loans
and
repayment
plans
,
pausing
on
the
slide
that
says
we
only
escape
our
loans
if
we
die
or
become
permanently
disabled
,
and
at
one
point
explaining
that
if
,
say
,
our
aunt
gives
us
a
few
thousand
dollars
for
graduation
,
we
should
put
that
toward
loan
debt
.
I
laughed
,
but
no
one
else
did
.
Leaving
the
session
,
I
had
to
wonder
who
are
y’all’s
aunts
?
How
many
people
have
faked
their
own
death
to
avoid
paying
off
student
loans
?
And
perhaps
more
importantly
,
how
much
did
any
of
us
really
understand
when
we
accepted
our
first
student
loan
four
years
ago
as
high
school
seniors
?
If
your
family
income
is
somewhere
above
40
,
000
a
year
,
but
not
high
enough
to
pay
full
price
,
and
you
didn’t
manage
to
snag
one
of
Duke’s
full
merit
scholarships
,
you
probably
have
some
student
loans
.
Like
most
Duke
undergraduates
with
family
incomes
over
85
,
000
who
still
qualify
for
financial
aid
,
I
have
taken
out
around
5
,
000
per
year
,
for
a
total
of
about
20
,
000
.
That's
the
average
for
Duke
,
according
to
Alison
Rabil
,
assistant
vice
provost
and
director
of
undergraduate
financial
aid
.
20
,
000
is
close
to
the
maximum
loan
burden
Duke
will
expect
undergraduates
to
take
out
,
and
the
limit
on
federal
loans
for
undergraduate
education
is
31
,
000
.
However
,
the
average
student
loan
debt
per
borrower
in
the
U
.
S
.
is
nearly
twice
my
burden
at
37
,
172
,
meaning
that
many
students
take
out
private
loans
in
addition
to
federal
loans
,
which
have
lower
,
fixed
interest
rates
.
Many
of
our
peer
universities
,
however
,
offer
loan
free
financial
aid
,
perhaps
due
in
part
to
their
larger
endowments
.
So
now
I'm
about
a
month
away
from
a
Duke
degree
,
and
I'm
in
debt
!
Here
are
three
things
about
student
loans
I
wish
I
had
known
four
years
ago
.
If
you
already
knew
these
things
,
I'm
happy
for
you
!
Feel
free
to
bask
in
your
superior
financial
literacy
.
There
are
three
types
of
loans
you
might
be
awarded
Federal
Direct
loans
the
subtypes
of
these
are
subsidized
,
unsubsidized
,
and
PLUS
,
Duke
administered
loans
this
includes
Perkins
and
Duke
educational
assistance
,
or
private
educational
loans
.
I
have
a
combination
of
the
first
two
types
,
except
they’re
all
considered
federal
loans
,
which
is
a
little
confusing
.
Here
are
my
five
loans
All
in
all
,
my
debt
is
22
,
500
.
Except
according
to
an
email
from
Duke
I
received
in
February
,
my
debt
is
higher
23
,
188
.
I
originally
assumed
my
loans
didn’t
start
accruing
interest
until
like
,
nine
months
after
graduation
?
Maybe
six
months
?
Clearly
,
I
wasn’t
paying
very
close
attention
when
I
signed
my
loan
agreement
,
called
a
master
promissory
note
,
at
the
end
of
my
first
year
of
college
.
As
it
turns
out
,
those
grace
periods
I
remembered
from
my
are
deferred
during
that
nine
month
post
graduation
grace
period
,
or
if
I
decide
to
go
to
graduate
school
.
The
averaged
interest
rate
for
all
my
loans
is
4
.
6
percent
,
which
means
I’ll
accrue
a
little
over
1
,
000
in
interest
per
year
about
3
per
day
though
over
time
the
amount
I
accrue
per
year
will
decrease
as
I
chip
away
at
the
original
loan
balance
,
called
the
principal
.
The
document
Duke
sent
me
in
February
estimates
that
my
monthly
payments
will
be
241
a
month
,
but
StudentLoans
.
gov
says
my
payments
will
be
around
186
a
month
if
I
enroll
in
the
standard
repayment
plan
.
Except
this
can’t
be
right
,
because
it
estimates
I’ll
only
pay
22
,
353
over
the
course
of
10
years
less
than
my
current
loan
balance
.
By
my
math
,
if
I
pay
around
241
a
month
for
ten
years
,
I’ll
pay
off
the
loan
,
but
also
pay
around
6
,
000
in
interest
.
I
now
have
a
decision
to
make
burn
my
savings
from
college
to
pay
down
some
of
my
loan
debt
now
,
before
it
begins
accruing
interest
,
or
keep
the
money
in
savings
and
instead
enroll
in
a
program
which
will
allow
me
to
make
lower
payments
based
on
my
income
,
and
hope
that
I
can
successfully
have
my
remaining
loans
forgiven
at
the
end
of
10
years
of
working
a
low
paying
public
service
job

on
time
student
loan
payments
in
that
time
.
The
first
class
of
students
who
completed
those
ten
years
became
eligible
to
actually
apply
for
loan
forgiveness
in
2017
.
Relying
on
the
program
is
more
of
a
gamble
than
it
sounds
according
to
the
headline
of
a
NYTimes
article
from
September
of
last
year
,
28
,
000
Public
Servants
Sought
Student
Loan
Forgiveness
.
96
Got
It
.
This
is
in
part
because
many
received
bad
information
from
their
loan
servicers
.
And
the
program
might
be
cut
entirely
in
the
future
,
depending
on
how
Congress
votes
.
If
I
enroll
in
an
income
based
repayment
plan
but
don't
end
up
qualifying
for
the
program
,
I
won't
pay
off
my
loans
for
several
more
years
,
and
I
will
pay
thousands
dollars
more
in
interest
over
the
life
of
the
loan
.
At
this
point
,
I'm
not
sure
if
it's
worth
the
gamble
.
The
language
on
the
financial
aid
website
says
students
are
awarded
loan
amounts
.
This
sounds
foolish
now
,
but
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
I
could
,
and
perhaps
should
,
decline
the
loans
I
was
awarded
.
These
aren’t
actually
awards
they’re
debt
.
And
that
means
that
you
don’t
have
to
take
them
on
if
you
can
find
other
ways
to
pay
tuition
and
live
.
Especially
this
year
,
my
living
expenses
are
much
lower
since
I
live
off
campus
and
don’t
buy
a
meal
plan
.
I've
been
able
to
save
a
few
thousand
dollars
since
starting
college
thanks
to
my
own
work
and
the
relative
wealth
of
my
family
,
so
in
retrospect
,
I
wish
I
hadn’t
accepted
all
my
financial
aid
awards
.
I
can
imagine
the
comment
section
on
this
column
now
a
handful
of
Boomers
explaining
that
when
they
went
to
Duke
in
the
late
1960s
,
they
didn’t
take
out
loans
and
instead
got
a
job
.
Thank
you
so
much
in
advance
for
those
comments
,
but
in
fact
,
I
,
too
,
worked
full
time
every
summer
and
usually
worked
between
two
and
four
part
time
jobs
per
semester
.
In
addition
to
being
a
course
assistant
and
middle
school
tutor
,
I
do
odd
jobs
I
copy
edit
legal
documents
and
self
published
romance
novels
on
a
freelancing
website
,
I
babysit
occasionally
and
participate
in
at
least
a
few
medical
or
behavioral
studies
per
month
.
For
extra
money
this
year
,
I’ve
gotten
EEGs
,
peed
into
cups
and
smoked
different
varieties
of
experimental
cigarettes
into
glass
tubes
in
a
lab
near
the
hospital
.
Though
I
budget
neurotically
,
last
year
I
made
about
6
,
000
total
not
nearly
enough
to
cover
the
cost
of
attending
Duke
.
The
salary
for
the
job
I’ve
accepted
next
year
is
about
27
,
500
,
plus
an
approximately
6
,
000
bonus
at
the
end
of
the
year
to
put
toward
graduate
school
or
loan
debt
.
Because
my
main
interests
are
education
,
social
work
and
journalism
,
I
don’t
imagine
I’ll
ever
have
a
job
which
pays
over
50
,
000
per
year
,
so
my
monthly
loan
payments
will
be
a
significant
chunk
of
my
budget
until
I
pay
them
off
.
It’s
easy
to
get
blinded
by
the
prestige
of
Duke
when
you
first
get
in
especially
with
an
acceptance
rate
of
around
5
percent
and
I’m
grateful
for
the
chance
to
have
come
here
and
the
intangible
benefits
my
education
has
brought
me
.
I
could
have
gone
to
a
different
school
and
graduated
without
loan
debt
,
but
ultimately
I
picked
Duke
because
I
thought
it
would
be
the
best
opportunity
to
learn
as
much
as
I
could
.
I
made
a
choice
to
take
on
this
debt
with
the
help
of
my
family
.
I
don’t
regret
that
choice
today
,
but
was
22
,
500
plus
interest
worth
it
?
Ask
me
again
in
ten
years
.
Here
is
what
you
do
not
know
about
the
press
section
of
the
Supreme
Court
of
the
United
States
.
A
staff
member
leads
reporters
single
file
from
the
press
room
to
the
hallway
.
We
walk
in
straight
lines
through
the
Supreme
Court
to
a
side
door
of
the
Courtroom
.
We’re
ushered
in
according
to
a
seat
number
.
More
important
reporters
get
to
squeeze
into
alcoves
at
the
side
of
the
Courtroom
.
Less
important
reporters
sit
in
the
back
,
their
view
of
the
bench
severely
obstructed
by
massive
marble
columns
.
I
like
to
joke
that
it
was
an
obstruction
of
justice
.
When
I
went
to
cover
a
Supreme
Court
case
for
The
Chronicle
,
I
was
assigned
a
seat
in
the
back
.
I
was
squeezed
between
two
people
,
balancing
on
a
too
hard
wooden
chair
,
with
only
my
legs
to
lean
on
to
take
notes
.
Two
Justices
were
visible
,
with
a
third
perceptible
if
I
craned
my
neck
.
It
was
surely
an
uncomfortable
experience
and
yet
it
was
the
experience
that
reaffirmed
my
love
for
what
I
do
at
The
Chronicle
.
When
first
I
entered
the
Supreme
Court
,
I
asked
a
security
guard
where
press
should
go
.
He
said
to
go
to
the
left
,
and
I
did
,
but
I
hesitated
when
I
was
faced
with
a
barrier
.
The
barrier
occluded
the
hallway
just
enough
so
that
a
person
could
go
around
.
But
the
message
was
clear
if
you’re
not
supposed
to
be
back
there
,
don’t
go
back
there
.
After
I
stared
at
the
barrier
for
a
good
minute
,
the
security
guard
told
me
that
I
could
just
go
around
.
But
even
then
,
when
I
went
around
the
barrier
and
I
saw
the
press
room
,
I
couldn’t
go
inside
.
Panic
struck
me
.
I
felt
an
imposter
I
wasn’t
a
journalist
,
not
like
the
people
milling
about
the
press
room
.
I
called
Bre
,
our
editor
in
chief
and
the
person
who
had
driven
me
up
to
D
.
C
.
When
she
picked
up
the
phone
,
word
salad
spilled
out
of
my
mouth
.
I
told
her
I
couldn’t
do
it
.
I
didn’t
know
what
to
do
.
There
were
real
journalists
in
there
.
Bre
told
me
that
didn’t
matter
.
I
had
a
place
in
there
,
and
I
should
take
it
.
This
year
,
I
was
news
editor
for
The
Chronicle
,
but
it
felt
like
a
mantle
I
could
never
really
fill
.
I’d
never
taken
any
journalism
classes
before
or
done
any
journalism
outside
this
newspaper
.
I
often
wouldn’t
trust
my
own
judgement
.
I
took
my
first
journalism
class
this
semester
,
a
science
writing
class
filled
with
graduate
students
in
the
sciences
and
not
a
single
student
interested
in
career
journalism
.
One
student
asked
the
professor
when
someone
becomes
a
journalist
after
writing
a
single
news
article
?
If
not
,
then
when
?
Could
the
students
consider
themselves
journalists
?
The
professor
,
knowing
that
I
was
a
part
of
The
Chronicle
,
asked
me
what
I
thought
.
I
said
,
I
don’t
know
.
I
don’t
consider
myself
a
journalist
.
He
told
me
that
I
shouldn’t
say
that
it
denigrated
all
the
work
I’d
done
.
I
recognize
that
now
.
My
news
department
is
all
just
students
,
who
all
have
various
aspirations
of
their
own
.
But
we’re
all
journalists
,
and
that’s
undeniably
important
when
our
work
holds
Duke
accountable
or
informs
the
public
.

This
year
,
we’ve
written
stories
that
have
enabled
actual
change
at
Duke
,
from
injustice
regarding
to
.
And
yes
,
we
did
that
while
taking
biochemistry
and
working
other
jobs
.
I
haven’t
devoted
three
years
to
The
Chronicle
because
I
want
a
line
on
my
resume
or
because
I
need
published
stories
to
go
into
journalism
.
I’ve
devoted
almost
1200
hours
to
The
Chronicle
because
I
think
this
work
is
incredibly
important
,
and
because
I
love
everyone
who
works
in
301
Flowers
.
I’ll
cherish
the
time
that
I
got
to
go
to
the
Supreme
Court
,
among
many
other
opportunities
that
The
Chronicle
has
given
me
.
But
above
all
,
I’ll
always
treasure
the
three
great
years
I’ve
had
as
a
writer
and
editor
for
this
newspaper
the
place
where
I
got
to
become
a
real
journalist
.
Last
weekend
,
I
volunteered
at
the
Duke
Coalition
for
Preserving
Memory’s
annual
Name
Reading
ceremony
to
commemorate
the
victims
of
the
seven
United
Nations
recognized
genocides
.
During
this
event
,
hundreds
of
students
and
community
members
recited
the
names
of
individuals
who
were
killed
in
these
crimes
against
humanity
for
24
consecutive
hours
on
Abele
Quad
.
As
I
read
aloud
the
names
of
people
who
lost
their
lives
in
the
Armenian
Genocide
,
many
thoughts
went
through
my
head
.
Why
hadn’t
I
ever
been
taught
about
this
?
How
could
I
read
posters
describing
genocides
as
ongoing
and
not
be
enraged
?
What
does
Never
Again
mean
if
horrendous
acts
of
ethnic
cleansing
continue
to
take
place
?
During
my
first
year
,
I
took
a
class
called
Human
Rights
and
World
Politics
through
the
Kenan
Institute
of
Ethics
.
Despite
completing
the
course
two
and
a
half
years
ago
,
I
continue
to
be
disturbed
by
one
of
our
readings
.
Samantha
Power
,
who
later
became
the
U
.
S
.
Ambassador
to
the
U
.
N
.
under
President
Obama
,
wrote
about
the
Clinton
Administration’s
failure
to
take
action
to
stop
the
Rwandan
Genocide
despite
being
aware
of
the
crimes
against
humanity
occuring
.
President
Clinton
chose
not
to
send
in
troops
because
of
the
calculation
made
than
an
American
life
was
worth
85
,
000
Rwandan
lives
.
As
the
names
and
locations
of
killing
targets
,
members
of
the
Tutsi
minority
,
were
projected
over
the
radio
,
the
United
States
failed
to
even
disrupt
the
airwaves
.
National
leaders
must
have
figured
that
the
American
people
would
not
deem
engagement
in
such
a
far
away
internal
conflict
worthwhile
.
By
the
end
of
the
genocide
,
over
800
,
000
Tutsis
had
been
brutally
murdered
.
I
was
so
angry
learning
about
the
U
.
S
.
decision
,
not
just
because
of
its
deadly
implications
,
but
also
because
it
demonstrated
how
easily
the
lesson
of
Never
Again
can
be
swept
aside
.
As
I
walked
around
the
display
at
the
Name
Reading
Ceremony
,
I
became
more
and
more
disturbed
.
Beginning
in
1915
,
the
Ottoman
Empire
began
rounding
up
,
deporting
and
executing
ethnic
Armenians
.
According
to
the
organization
United
to
End
Genocide
,
the
combination
of
massacres
,
forced
deportation
marches
and
deaths
due
to
disease
in
concentration
camps
is
estimated
to
have
killed
more
than
1
million
ethnic
Armenians
,
Assyrians
and
Greeks
.
However
,
the
Turkish
government
denies
this
genocide
ever
occured
,
and
I
had
barely
heard
anything
about
it
.
During
the
Holocaust
,
the
Nazis
brutally
murdered
over
6
million
Jews
and
five
million
non
Jews
.
Had
the
Nazis
accomplished
their
goal
,
I
wouldn’t
be
alive
today
,
and
you
would
only
be
able
to
learn
about
the
Jewish
people
in
history
books
.
Yet
,
according
to
an
article
in
The
Atlantic
,
two
thirds
of
the
world’s
population
do
not
know
the
Holocaust
happened
or
deny
its
gravity
.
The
United
States
is
not
immune
from
this
phenomenon
;
according
a
report
completed
in
2010
by
a
student
at
Harvard
University
,
millions
of
Americans
continue
to
deny
the
Holocaust
.
A
couple
days
after
the
Name
Reading
ceremony
,
I
decided
to
Google
search
current
genocides
.
I
found
a
headline
from
an
article
written
in
2017
titled
5
genocides
that
are
still
going
on
today
.
How
is
this
possible
?
As
someone
who
feels
a
responsibility
to
ensure
Never
Again
,
I
was
horrified
to
realize
that
five
genocides
are
still
being
perpetrated
the
Rohingya
in
Myanmar
,
the
Nuer
and
other
ethnic
groups
in
South
Sudan
,
Christians
and
Yazidis
in
Iraq
and
Syria
,
Muslims
and
Christians
in
the
Central
African
Republic
,
and
the
Darfuris
in
Sudan
.
I
began
to
wonder
why
these
crimes
have
not
received
the
public
attention
they
deserve
.
In
recent
days
,
there
have
been
countless
articles
about
the
Notre
Dame
fire
.
I
definitely
understand
how
saddening
this
event
is
because
of
the
religious
and
historic
significance
of
the
Cathedral
,
which
I
was
fortunate
to
witness
when
visiting
Paris
last
year
.
However
,
the
indiscriminate
slaughter
of
human
beings
simply
because
of
who
they
are
or
what
they
believe
is
even
more
reprehensible
,
yet
these
event
have
not
gotten
nearly
as
much
publicity
.
The
lack
of
attention
may
be
due
to
two
unfortunate
reasons
ignorance
and
indifference
.
Because
many
of
us
are
unaware
of
these
ongoing
events
,
it’s
less
likely
for
them
to
come
up
in
conversations
.
This
is
definitely
due
,
in
part
,
to
the
media’s
lack
of
coverage
of
these
issues
.
But
,
as
newspapers
profit
from
providing
content
that
people
want
to
read
,
the
absence
of
articles
about
the
genocides
underway
suggests
the
second
reason
indifference
.
If
more
people
felt
a
greater
sense
of
connection
or
responsibility
to
stop
atrocities
taking
place
across
the
globe
,
media
outlets
may
be
more
inclined
to
cover
them
.
Just
as
some
people
dismissed
the
Rwandan
genocide
as
people
far
away
killing
each
other
,
similar
sentiments
persist
today
.
Individuals
may
feel
that
their
voice
won’t
have
an
impact
because
of
these
events
occurring
beyond
America’s
borders
or
the
lack
of
societal
activism
considered
necessary
to
generate
change
.
I
understand
the
strength
of
this
pressure
,
and
I’m
not
immune
to
it
when
I
had
planned
to
post
on
my
Facebook
about
the
Rohingya
,
I
refrained
from
doing
so
.
I
was
worried
that
many
of
my
friends
would
be
indifferent
.
Perceptions
like
these
help
explain
how
we
are
sitting
idly
by
as
genocide
is
occuring
.
What
should
we
do
about
this
problem
?
I
believe
the
answer
is
feeling
a
greater
sense
of
empathy
for
people
across
the
globe
.
We
should
feel
deeply
concerned
for
people
being
persecuted
for
their
identities
,
as
they
are
human
beings
just
like
us
.
Ignorance
is
not
bliss
;
we
should
strive
to
learn
more
about
what’s
going
on
in
the
world
and
speak
out
for
people’s
rights
.
We
should
bring
these
tragedies
up
with
our
friends
to
make
them
aware
,
post
on
social
media
,
and
call
our
members
of
Congress
.
These
actions
could
lead
to
a
domino
effect
,
as
others
will
become
more
informed
and
choose
to
do
what
they
can
to
spread
the
word
.
As
members
of
the
Duke
community
,
we
are
all
familiar
with
the
ideal
of
Knowledge
in
the
Service
of
Society
.
I
can’t
think
of
a
better
way
to
serve
society
than
standing
up
for
those
whose
lives
are
being
targeted
simply
because
of
their
identities
.
We
can
do
our
part
to
make
Never
Again
not
just
a
slogan
,
but
a
reality
for
people
across
the
globe
.
It
starts
with
us
.
I’ve
written
for
The
Chronicle’s
Editorial
Board
for
almost
my
entire
time
at
Duke
.
I’m
proud
of
so
many
of
our
articles
and
can’t
express
in
words
how
profoundly
I
love
my
Board
members
.
Finally
,
after
what’s
felt
like
a
lifetime
,
I’m
leaving
the
University
for
good
and
have
little
intention
of
returning
.
In
lieu
of
the
traditional
senior
column
full
of
memorable
anecdotes
and
or
spiteful
resentment
,
I
wanted
my
first
by
line
to
be
this
important
editorial
that
failed
to
get
published
this
year
.
In
writing
this
introduction
,
I
am
thinking
of
and
mourning
the
countless
lives
lost
to
the
violence
of
capitalism
and
those
who
were
displaced
by
cruel
opportunists
like
David
Rubenstein
.
On
April
7th
,
the
late
night
HBO
talk
show
hosted
by
John
Oliver
aired
a
piece
on
mobile
homes
.
The
of
the
15
minute
segment
has
already
amassed
nearly
five
million
views
and
focuses
on
exploitation
of
manufactured
home
owners
by
wealthy
investment
firms
.
While
those
who
live
in
mobile
homes
usually
own
their
residence
,
they
pay
rent
on
the
land
it’s
residing
in
.
In
the
past
few
years
,
private
equity
firms
have
been
buying
up
mobile
home
parks
and
sharply
increasing
rent
to
astronomical
levels
for
the
majority
.
Because
,
as
John
Oliver
points
out
,
manufactured
homes
are
not
easy
or
cheap
to
relocate
,
poor
residents
on
fixed
incomes
face
eviction
and
homelessness
as
rent
increases
threaten
to
price
them
out
of
their
mobile
home
parks
.
Between
clips
of
residents
explaining
that
they’ve
had
to
ration
medication
to
keep
up
with
rent
hikes
,
a
familiar
face
David
Rubenstein
.
A
1970
graduate
,
former
Board
of
Trustees
Chair
,
namesake
of
the
David
M
.
Rubenstein
Rare
Book
and
Manuscripts
Library
,
and
financer
of
a
for
low
income
students
,
he’s
best
known
on
Duke
campus
for
his
philanthropy
and
staggering
donations
.
However
,
Rubenstein
is
also
a
co
founder
and
co
executive
chairman
of
the
Carlyle
Group
,
one
of
the
largest
private
equity
firms
in
the
world
with
a
self
reported
.
While
his
accomplishments
are
well
broadcasted
,
what
you
won’t
hear
in
Rubenstein’s
or
read
in
is
how
his
investment
firm
has
produced
through
on
poor
residents
.
Private
equity
firms
work
by
collecting
large
sums
of
money
from
the
uber
wealthy
to
buy
companies
in
hopes
of
changing
them
to
turn
a
profit
often
through
maneuvers
like
or
,
in
the
case
of
the
Carlyle
Group
and
manufactured
homes
parks
,
and
gouging
low
income
residents
who
can’t
afford
to
move
.
Carlyle
group
has
also
made
its
billions
through
One
company
the
firm
owns
Combined
Systems
International
manufactures
tear
gas
that
has
been
used
in
and
in
.
This
reality
of
poor
mobile
home
residents
facing
homelessness
and
Black
Lives
Matter
organizers
being
tear
gassed
to
the
financial
benefit
of
Rubenstein’s
investment
firm
is
a
far
cry
from
the
persona
he
has
on
campus
as
a
benevolent
philanthropist
.
These
connections
,
in
fact
,
throw
the
morality
of
accepting
any
of
Rubenstein's
donations
into
question
.
The
danger
of
philanthropy
is
how
the
often
violent
origins
of
extreme
wealth
are
obscured
by
occasional
monetary
donations
.
Rich
individuals
Jeff
Bezos
,
for
example
who
amass
obscene
sums
of
money
through
spend
an
incredibly
small
fraction
of
their
wealth
on
and
receive
praise
,
while
paying
little
to
.
The
fact
that
some
of
Rubenstein’s
money
is
going
to
a
handful
of
low
income
students
doesn’t
change
the
fact
that
his
wealth
is
in
part
collected
through
harming
the
poor
and
the
result
of
a
regressive
tax
policy
that
to
the
whims
of
the
rich
.
Philanthropy
and
charity
can’t
make
up
for
the
crushing
structural
that
make
possible
Rubenstein's
unimaginable
affluence
,
nor
can
it
ethically
compensate
for
the
deeply
immoral
roots
of
that
wealth
accumulation
.
I
am
not
writing
this
with
the
belief
that
things
will
change
.
In
fact
,
I’m
fully
aware
this
is
more
or
less
a
practice
of
screaming
into
the
proverbial
void
.
But
,
I
want
this
archived
to
contribute
to
a
paper
trail
cataloguing
the
shameful
and
irredeemable
evil
of
David
Rubenstein’s
financial
investments
.
Previously
,
the
Graduate
School
did
not
cover
gym
fees
for
graduate
students
after
their
third
year
.
Dear
Duke
community
,
Last
week
marked
a
historic
victory
for
the
Duke
Graduate
Students
Union
,
SEIU
Workers
United
Southern
Region
Local
27
.
We’ve
been
fighting
for
over
a
year
to
force
Duke
to
guarantee
a
12
month
living
stipend
for
all
grad
workers
.
After
months
of
meeting
with
the
Academic
Council
,
collecting
petition
signatures
,
writing
op
eds
,
securing
a
GPSC
resolution
,
and
applying
public
pressure
,
the
Graduate
School
buckled
and
agreed
to
pay
Ph
.
D
.
students
a
12
month
living
wage
.
This
enormous
victory
will
put
thousands
of
dollars
in
the
pockets
of
grad
workers
.
It’s
a
testament
to
the
power
of
our
union
and
unions
everywhere
!
Make
no
mistake
Duke
would
never
have
announced
this
change
had
it
not
been
for
the
tireless
organizing
of
Duke
grad
workers
.
Gains
often
feel
inevitable
after
we
win
them
,
but
nothing
about
this
gain
was
inevitable
.
A
year
ago
,
a
commitment
from
university
administrators
to
meet
our
demands
seemed
unfathomable
.
Now
,
12
month
pay
starting
in
August
at
a
living
wage
is
a
reality
.
This
only
happened
because
grad
workers
mobilized
,
built
power
,
and
.
It
also
threatens
to
make
departments
choose
between
a
living
wage
for
grad
workers
and
crucial
components
of
doctoral
education
like
cohort
size
.
But
if
we
can
pressure
Duke
to
commit
to
a
living
wage
,
we
can
get
them
to
move
on
a
faster
timeline
and
without
such
unfair
trade
offs
.
It’s
our
job
to
organize
so
that
every
PhD
student
can
live
decently
while
at
Duke
!
We’ve
proven
we
can
make
that
happen
.
And
with
your
help
,
we’re
going
to
make
it
happen
.
Join
us
this
Thursday
,
April
18
,
from
11
a

You’re
invited
to
help
us
celebrate
our
union’s
power
and
continue
the
struggle
!
In
Solidarity
,
Trying
out
the
Wilson
rock
climbing
wall
was
on
my
first
year
at
Duke
!
bucket
list
,
so
when
a
friend
asked
me
to
climb
last
weekend
,
I
thought
I
would
give
it
a
try
.
I
strapped
on
the
harness
and
awkwardly
shaped
climbing
shoes
with
a
feeling
of
readiness
,
excitement
and
confidence
as
I
measured
up
the
plastic
ascending
above
me
.
I
mastered
the
knot
in
my
rope
,
firmly
declared
on
belay
!
’
and
grasped
the
first
green
hold
that
would
take
me
to
the
top
.
The
first
few
minutes
,
I
felt
I
was
flying
.
I
was
ascending
steadily
,
painless
.
Wow
,
you
are
a
natural
,
I
told
myself
first
time
and
you’re
already
halfway
there
!
As
I
started
passing
the
halfway
point
,
little
sharp
pains
began
to
burn
in
my
forearms
.
Shake
it
off
,
I
told
myself
,
you
got
this
.
I
kept
climbing
,
but
soon
after
my
stint
of
self
motivation
,
I
was
forced
to
face
some
soul
shattering
dilemmas
.
The
one
green
hold
in
sight
seemed
miles
above
me
,
my
foot
was
slipping
from
a
finger
sized
hold’
,
and
my
forearms
felt
like
they
would
fall
off
any
minute
.
Why
had
my
sky
high
state
of
confidence
turned
into
a
rocky
mess
of
stagnation
?
I
glanced
around
the
wall
.
Why
are
all
the
other
students
at
Duke
apparently
literal
tree
frogs
,
gripping
corners
of
the
wall
I
could
not
even
see
,
scaling
at
rates
I
thought
impossible
?
Then
I
thought
about
what
the
climbing
wall
employee
mentioned
at
the
desk
,
that
the
numbers
on
the
walls
represent
the
difficulty
of
the
climb
,
starting
with
5
.
5
.
I
saw
walls
labeled
5
.
8
,
5
.
10
,
5
.
11
and
Dukies
ascending
them
with
ease
.
I
looked
for
the
label
on
mine
5
.

.
YOU
CAN
DO
IT
!
my
friend
shouted
.

our
editorially
curated
,
weekly

.
Cancel
at
any
time
.
Fine
.
I
pushed
through
the
pain
.
Eventually
,
a
while
later
,
I
made
it
to
the
rather
disappointingly
ugly
reward
of
the
metal
ring
holding
the
ropes
at
the
top
of
the
wall
.
I
find
this
rock
climbing
experience
has
some
parallels
to
my
first
year
.
As
I
reflect
on
this
year
at
Duke
,
I
remember
sometimes
having
similar
feelings
of
being
stuck
and
unable
to
see
a
green
hold
on
the
wall
,
or
feelings
of
not
measuring
up
against
the
wall
scaling
extraordinaires
around
me
.
This
measure
up’
mindset
was
stressful
,
and
it
was
one
I
too
frequently
fell
into
adapting
this
year
.
I
entered
this
first
year
eager
and
open
to
the
incredible
grandeur
of
the
world
of
Duke
.
I
felt
confident
and
ready
I
had
performed
to
the
standard
to
get
to
the
place
,
I
told
myself
,
so
I
must
be
able
to
belong
based
on
my
ability
.
My
first
year
has
taught
me
that
there
is
a
much
more
fulfilling
philosophy
.
Instead
of
seeing
people
and
myself
as
climbers
scaling
the
ladder
of
success
,
I
want
to
appreciate
people
for
their
incredible
individuality
,
their
backgrounds
and
beliefs
.
I
learned
from
and
connected
to
people
so
much
better
with
this
mindset
.
As
a
friend
once
told
me
,
we
are
called
human
beings
and
not
human
for
a
reason
.
A
Duke
narrative
based
on
how
I
perform
tells
me
my
failures
are
unacceptable
because
they
prevent
me
from
climbing
a
rung
higher
on
the
ladder
of
capitalistic
success
.
My
personal
creeds
based
on
the
value
of
who
am
I
tell
me
my
failures
are
embraced
because
they
teach
me
how
to
become
more
adaptable
,
stronger
,
and
more
assured
.
I
am
choosing
a
reflection
of
my
first
year
that
is
not
rooted
in
how
far
I
have
climbed
up
the
rock
wall
toward
my
career
goals
or
success
based
on
society’s
values
of
prestige
and
monetary
power
.
I
am
choosing
a
reflection
of
my
first
year
that
is
rooted
in
gratitude
.
I
am
grateful
for
our
beautiful
campus
it
seems
the
flowers
and
trees
are
expressing
their
own
gratitude
this
time
of
year
although
the
pollen
may
be
saying
thanks
a
bit
too
loudly
.
I
am
grateful
for
the
piano
in
the
Pegram
common
room
and
Tre
Jones’
return
.
I
am
grateful
for
the
diversity
of
the
worldviews
of
people
here
and
for
professors
who
invest
in
me
.
In
this
grateful
reflection
on
my
first
year
,
I
find
that
clearly
we
are
privileged
.
I
believe
this
point
underscores
ever
more
an
ethical
obligation
for
gratitude
.
I
think
that
when
we
use
gratitude
,
we
are
also
intrinsically
breaking
down
levels
of
hierarchy
or
social
levels
because
gratitude
itself
levels
playing
fields
and
elicits
humility
in
relationships
.
Gratitude
also
requires
our
complete
attention
to
our
surroundings
,
meaning
that
we
lose
our
self
absorption
.
A
professor
told
me
a
story
that
I
think
illustrates
this
point
well
.
Once
,
there
was
a
pre
med
student
at
Duke
who
was
also
a
talented
violinist
.
She
fell
into
a
frenzy
focusing
on
,
correcting
,
mulling
over
her
mistakes
.
One
day
during
a
lesson
,
her
teacher
stopped
her
playing
and
asked
her
to
leave
the
room
.
Her
teacher
told
her
to
knock
and
re
enter
,
and
to
act
like
a
doctor
coming
into
a
clinic
to
treat
a
patient
.
When
the
girl
reentered
,
the
teacher
acted
sick
and
hurting
,
eager
for
trust
and
guidance
from
the
student
,
reaching
out
and
pleading
her
.
The
girl
had
to
care
for
nothing
but
her
teacher
at
that
moment
.
She
had
to
choose
attention
and
empathy
over
her
perfectionism
and
self
editing
.
And
the
teacher
said
that
that
is
how
you
should
play
the
violin
,
with
complete
absorption
,
curiosity
,
care
and
attention
for
the
music
overcoming
self
absorption
.
As
a
pre
medical
student
,
I
also
find
myself
often
tight
and
stressed
because
I
focus
on
grasping
that
next
hold
as
I
climb
closer
to
my
goal
of
medical
school
.
Yet
,
this
first
year
has
led
me
to
ask
what
if
I
free
myself
to
be
absorbed
in
learning
for
the
sake
of
learning
and
free
myself
from
the
stress
of
pre
professional
perfectionism
?
My
first
year
has
emphasized
my
love
of
liberal
arts
where
we
are
learning
about
why
humans
are
as
well
as
how
humans
are
.
I
have
found
the
value
in
Duke’s
speaker
events
,
including
Honor
Council’s
events
,
to
learn
about
the
ethics
behind
the
STEM
material
I
learn
in
my
classes
.
After
my
first
year
,
I
believe
that
the
importance
of
learning
about
who
we
are
in
this
world
points
to
our
need
for
a
more
well
rounded
,
liberal
arts
education
where
each
student
graduates
having
read
more
of
the
great
works
of
literature
,
philosophy
and
ethics
.
Curiosity
and
care
overcome
self
absorption
when
we
study
and
learn
to
grow
as
humans
,
not
to
grab
another
rung
in
the
ladder
toward
our
career
goals
.
My
last
reflection
of
my
first
year
is
a
challenge
to
myself
and
others
write
an
actual
,
physical
handwritten
thank
you
note
.
To
a
professor
.
To
the
person
who
cleans
your
beautiful
dorm
.
To
a
coworker
.
To
someone
who
has
cared
for
and
valued
you
for
who
you
are
,
not
how
far
or
how
fast
you
can
ascend
the
climbing
wall
of
cultural
success
.
At
Duke
,
you’ll
find
secrets
everywhere
you
look
in
the
faces
of
gargoyles
hiding
beneath
Gothic
arches
,
whispered
between
students
on
the
bus
,
buried
in
the
Chapel
crypt
.
These
days
,
it
seems
like
every
college
student
is
looking
for
a
way
to
get
something
off
their
chest
.
We
practically
carry
around
billboard
sized
canvases
to
print
our
secrets
on
,
in
the
form
of
a
Me
Too
monologue
,
a
Twitter
thread
,
or
a
Chronicle
column
.
What
makes
these
platforms
so
easy
to
share
on
,
though
,
is
their
relative
anonymity
.
nbsp
;
They
allow
you
to
broadcast
your
hurt
online
without
letting
those
closest
to
you
know
the
sh
t
that
you’re
stumbling
through
in
person
.
To
be
vulnerable
costs
something
.
Over
four
years
of
college
I’ve
learned
that
to
bear
pain
alone
costs
something
,
too
.
I
read
this
somewhere
,
I
can't
remember
where
These
silences
at
times
when
it
mattered
start
to
add
up
.
And
,
over
time
,
their
weight
can
feel
unbearable
,
marking
all
of
the
million
little
ways
we
are
quiet
about
our
feelings
to
the
people
we
love
.
I’m
here
to
say
let’s
stop
this
cycle
.
Let’s
learn
how
to
say
the
quiet
thing
out
loud
.
A
friend
once
stopped
me
before
we
walked
into
his
apartment
and
said
It’s
a
mess
.
I’m
not
doing
great
right
now
.
And
he
was
right
cups
and
shoes
and
pizza
boxes
littered
on
every
surface
,
trash
spilling
out
of
the
garbage
can
.
But
there
was
something
honest
about
how
he
said
it
as
he
opened
the
door
This
is
me
.
I’m
imperfect
.
Do
you
still
want
to
be
let
in
?
He
was
letting
me
in
on
a
secret
.
I
can
only
hope
for
the
same
kind
of
honesty
in
relationships
down
the
line
this
is
me
.
These
are
the
parts
of
me
that
are
hidden
,
and
messed
up
,
and
a
mess
.
And
can
you
still
love
me
?
I’ll
tell
you
another
secret
the
answer
will
probably
be
yes
.
My
four
years
at
Duke
University
have
been
characterized
by
political
tumult
and
global
uncertainty
,
undergirded
by
a
growing
mistrust
in
journalism
and
more
fundamentally
,
disbelief
in
the
truth
.
Attacks
against
reporters
became
more
common
,
with
both
online
criticism
and
physical
violence
increasing
in
recent
years
.
The
news
became
fake
news
.
Nationally
,
we
think
about
this
problem
in
terms
of
our
national
and
international
news
organizations
.
Many
hold
up
organizations
like
the
New
York
Times
and
the
Washington
Post
as
examples
of
respected
institutions
that
can
mostly
be
trusted
,
while
criticizing
others
as
biased
and
fake
.
Yet
many
of
these
views
are
similarly
biased
as
the
biases
they
claim
to
find
in
the
news
.
There
is
a
growing
movement
to
educate
the
public
about
the
process
of
journalism
and
how
articles
be
they
extensive
investigations
,
short
government
pieces
,
food
reviews
,
or
sports
gamers
end
up
on
paper
and
on
the
screen
for
anyone
to
read
.
But
college
newspapers
have
been
doing
this
for
decades
.
And
journalism
in
the
United
States
would
not
work
without
the
work
The
Chronicle
and
hundreds
of
other
college
newspapers
have
done
to
give
Americans
an
introduction
to
the
news
.
When
I
came
to
Duke
as
a
first
year
student
,
I
did
not
have
much
of
an
interest
in
joining
The
Chronicle
.
I
was
interested
in
science
and
medicine
and
had
no
interest
in
journalism
.
A
then
senior
who
was
giving
me
advice
about
the
different
organizations
on
campus
piqued
my
interest
when
he
said
that
The
Chronicle
was
terrible
,
and
I
should
not
join
.
As
someone
who
is
always
curious
,
this
comment
had
the
opposite
effect
,
spurring
me
to
go
to
an
information
session
the
following
day
.
Within
a
week
,
I
had
written
my
first
article
and
taken
photos
of
my
first
event
sadly
,
the
newswriting
part
did
not
stick
.
As
I
would
learn
over
my
four
years
,
this
senior
was
by
no
means
the
only
person
who
took
issue
with
The
Chronicle
.
I
always
found
it
interesting
to
compare
the
problems
people
claimed
The
Chronicle
had
and
the
information
I
knew
from
being
involved
in
the
newspaper
as
a
photographer
.
What
I
realized
was
that
many
of
the
problems
people
identified
had
more
to
do
with
them
not
understanding
how
a
newspaper
works
or
what
the
purpose
of
a
newspaper
is
.
People
did
not
understand
how
an
editorial
board
works
which
I
can
somewhat
understand
,
since
every
paper
seems
to
run
their
editorial
board
a
bit
differently
.
Some
did
not
understand
that
if
you
do
not
want
to
be
quoted
by
a
reporter
who
properly
identified
themselves
as
a
reporter
,
you
have
to
ask
to
ask
to
be
off
the
record
or
refuse
the
interview
in
the
first
place
.
Many
did
not
understand
that
letters
to
the
editor
are
typically
not
rejected
for
ideological
grounds
the
very
foundation
of
a
newspaper
is
freedom
of
speech
.
A
few
did
not
understand
that
newspapers
will
not
simply
talk
to
one
source
and
follow
that
source’s
narrative
in
a
vacuum
,
without
any
external
context
.
In
many
ways
,
a
core
responsibility
of
The
Chronicle
is
to
correct
these
misunderstandings
.
And
I
think
we
do
a
pretty
decent
job
.
I
have
seen
our
staff
explain
the
inner
workings
of
the
paper
to
countless
students
on
campus
.
Our
opinion
section
has
gone
to
significant
lengths
to
differentiate
editorials
,
columns
,
and
letters
and
highlight
what
those
categories
actually
signify
.
Our
reporters
regularly
educate
sources
about
how
to
interact
with
reporters
despite
it
sometimes
not
being
the
best
thing
for
them
to
do
as
far
as
getting
the
story
is
concerned
.
Plus
,
The
Chronicle
and
college
in
general
provides
a
slightly
lower
stakes
environment
for
mistakes
to
be
made
and
learned
from
.
After
all
,
being
quoted
on
one’s
opinion
about
the
new
restaurant
on
campus
is
hardly
going
to
ruin
anyone’s
future
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
The
Chronicle
does
not
publish
life
altering
and
important
pieces
.
There
have
been
numerous
investigations
and
scandals
of
national
attention
during
my
four
years
that
would
counter
this
narrative
.
But
these
are
the
abnormal
;
The
Chronicle
is
typically
more
focused
on
the
hyper
local
and
transient
in
significance
.
I
have
immense
respect
for
and
pride
in
the
staff
and
editors
of
The
Chronicle
that
came
before
me
,
the
ones
who
shaped
my
experience
at
Duke
,
and
the
ones
who
will
be
here
after
I
leave
.
For
a
group
that
is
oftentimes
misunderstood
and
has
to
spend
a
significant
amount
of
time
educating
the
public
,
they
do
an
amazing
job
on
the
front
lines
of
defending
American
journalism
.
To
the
301
Flowers
crew
,
thank
you
for
a
spectacular
four
years
of
learning
,
growth
and
mentorship
.
Keep
on
fighting
the
good
fight
.
Last
week
,
Georgetown
University
students
voted
nbsp
;
in
favor
of
a
referendum
suggesting
a
27
.
20
tuition
increase
.
If
the
referendum
is
approved
by
their
Board
of
Trustees
,
the
extra
revenue
will
be
used
to
fund
charitable
purposes
to
benefit
the
descendants
of
the
272
enslaved
people
sold
by
the
University
in
1838
to
pay
its
debts
.
In
2017
,
Georgetown
formally
apologized
for
the
sale
as
part
of
a
larger
effort
to
grapple
with
its
history
,
especially
in
relation
to
slavery
.
That
same
week
,
UNC
Chapel
Hill
Police
announced
that
two
people
were
arrested
for
the
March
vandalism
of
the
Unsung
Founders
Memorial
at
UNC
,
a
commemoration
of
labor
done
by
people
of
color
at
the
university
.
These
two
events
remind
us
that
the
histories
of
our
universities
are
often
intertwined
with
exploitation
,
whether
of
enslaved
people
or
otherwise
,
and
we
retain
an
obligation
to
confront
and
expose
these
histories
.
The
policy
proposal
endorsed
by
two
thirds
of
student
voters
at
Georgetown
would
be
the
first
attempt
by
an
institution
of
higher
education
to
use
student
funds
to
monetarily
correct
its
historical
transgressions
in
other
words
,
to
pay
reparations
.
In
the
previously
referenced
2017
apology
,
Georgetown
president
John
J
.
DeGioia
nbsp
;
made
clear
that
slavery
was
an
evil
that
our
university
was
complicit
in
and
that
the
school
will
engage
in
a
communal
reckoning
.
Since
then
,
Georgetown
officials
have
also
renamed
two
buildings
on
campus
that
had
previously
memorialized
Jesuits
involved
in
slavery
.
Additionally
,
an
African
American
Studies
Department
has
been
created
and
the
university
plans
to
unveil
a
Institute
for
the
Study
of
Slavery
and
its
Legacies
among
a
slew
of
other
reforms
.
Although
Georgetown’s
stab
at
reckoning
is
unique
,
the
university’s
involvement
in
slavery
is
certainly
not
.
Samuel
Stanhope
Smith
,
Princeton’s
nbsp
;
seventh
nbsp
;
president
1795
1812
was
not
only
a
slaveholder
but
also
the
inspiration
for
the
American
Colonization
Society
,
an
organization
dedicated
to
sending
freed
slaves
back
to
Africa
under
the
assumption
that
they
were
unable
to
integrate
into
American
society
.
All
six
of
Princeton’s
presidents
before
Smith
nbsp
;
were
slaveholders
as
well
,
as
were
the
two
to
follow
him
.
Though
Duke
University
was
formally
established
in
1924
,
the
history
of
our
University
is
also
clearly
connected
to
slavery
,
a
reality
which
we
as
a
community
continue
to
neglect
.
Though
it
is
not
mentioned
on
the
Rubenstein
Library
page
about
him
,
Washington
Duke
,
the
industrialist
for
whom
Duke
University
is
named
,
purchased
nbsp
;
a
girl
named
Caroline
,
who
was
no
more
than
twelve
years
old
at
the
time
.
She
remained
enslaved
to
the
Duke
family
for
at
least
five
years
,
after
which
there
are
no
more
records
of
her
existence
.
Furthermore
,
according
to
the
Duke
Homestead
historic
site
and
museum
,
Duke
also
rented
the
services
of
an
enslaved
man
named
Jim
in
the
early
years
of
the
Civil
War
.
Contrary
to
the
sanitized
narrative
of
the
Dukes
as
beneficiaries
of
hard
work
and
good
fortune
,
it
is
undeniable
that
their
success
and
thus
the
establishment
of
this
University
are
intertwined
with
the
ugly
realities
of
forced
labor
and
enslavement
.
The
history
of
the
Duke
family
is
not
the
only
part
of
the
University
steeped
in
racist
legacies
.
Duke
recently
complied
with
a
demand
to
remove
the
name
of
Julian
Carr
,
a
virulent
white
supremacist
from
a
building
on
East
Campus
.
Previously
,
nbsp
;
the
first
year
dormitory
Aycock
,
named
after
the
North
Carolina
governor
and
staunch
segregationist
,
was
renamed
East
Residence
Hall
.
A
similarly
unknown
history
is
that
of
the
Trinity
College
students
who
formed
the
Trinity
Guard
,
a
quasi
reserve
force
created
to
support
the
Confederate
war
effort
,
many
of
whom
served
as
guards
at
a
Confederate
POW
camp
.
Georgetown’s
actions
come
at
a
time
when
several
politicians
vying
for
the
Democratic
nomination
for
the
presidency
have
advocated
for
reparations
,
bringing
a
once
niche
recommendation
to
the
forefront
of
national
discourse
.
Yet
the
defacement
of
the
memorial
at
UNC
as
well
as
the
still
unresolved
debate
over
Silent
Sam
,
the
confederate
monument
,
remind
us
that
if
the
needle
has
moved
at
all
,
it
has
been
very
little
.
We
write
not
to
offer
policy
recommendations
or
under
any
pretense
of
having
the
solution
to
centuries
of
oppression
and
violence
.
But
if
these
recent
stories
at
Georgetown
,
down
the
road
at
UNC
,
or
in
the
national
political
news
suggest
anything
to
us
,
it
is
that
now
may
be
the
time
to
grapple
with
histories
long
ignored
and
with
the
present
realities
of
marginalization
and
bigotry
that
continue
.
It
is
absolutely
the
least
we
could
do
.
I
fell
into
arts
journalism
as
a
fluke
,
more
than
anything
.
I
knew
I
wanted
to
write
for
the
Chronicle
coming
into
college
,
but
I
didn’t
know
which
section
I
wanted
to
write
for
or
even
,
honestly
,
that
there
were
different
sections
.
And
I
certainly
didn’t
know
that
you
could
devote
an
entire
section
to
a
hodgepodge
of
music
and
film
reviews
,
artist
profiles
and
the
most
recent
cultural
happenings
on
and
off
campus
.
At
my
first
few
Recess
meetings
,
I
was
struck
by
just
how
interesting
and
knowledgeable
all
of
the
upperclassmen
were
They
all
had
evolved
opinions
on
albums
and
movies
I’d
never
heard
of
,
or
were
writing
senior
theses
,
or
knew
exactly
how
to
structure
a
campus
arts
piece
or
a
review
.
But
more
than
that
,
I
was
struck
by
how
much
they
cared
about
the
work
they
did
,
and
how
committed
they
were
to
sharing
their
knowledge
with
others
,
be
it
through
writing
articles
themselves
or
mentoring
freshmen
like
me
.
This
level
of
commitment
to
something
entirely
non
academic
hooked
me
,
and
made
me
realize
I
could
be
a
part
of
something
truly
special
.
What
made
me
stick
with
Recess
,
and
eventually
lead
it
,
was
the
sense
of
wonder
I
got
out
of
listening
to
sources
talk
about
their
art
,
and
what
drove
them
to
make
it
.
Looking
back
over
four
years
,
my
favorite
interviews
haven’t
been
with
the
most
impressive
people
,
but
with
those
who
were
so
excited
about
what
they
were
talking
about
that
they
couldn’t
stop
smiling
,
and
I
couldn’t
stop
smiling
either
.
The
entrepreneurs
,
filmmakers
and
photographers
I’ve
been
able
to
interview
have
been
some
of
the
most
infectiously
enthusiastic
people
I’ve
met
.
After
all
,
no
one
goes
into
the
arts
for
the
money
you
have
to
do
it
for
love
.
Duke
can
be
scary
and
overwhelming
at
times
,
and
being
able
to
set
aside
a
few
hours
each
week
to
talk
to
artists
,
thinkers
and
dreamers
made
me
see
time
and
time
again
that
Duke
isn’t
such
a
bad
place
after
all
.
Interviewing
so
many
people
who
were
following
their
passions
let
me
follow
mine
,
right
down
a
journalism
path
.
Unlike
news
and
sports
,
plenty
of
Recess
stories
aren’t
begging
to
be
written
.
We
choose
to
write
them
,
to
dive
into
the
impact
of
Durham
theater
closing
,
a
new
program
supporting
local
community
artists
,
a
campus
play
bringing
Ukrainian
theater
to
Duke
.
We
aren’t
really
holding
the
university
accountable
,
but
rather
shining
a
light
on
what
make
Duke
and
Durham
interesting
.
Separately
,
they
all
seem
a
little
eccentric
,
but
together
,
they’re
a
mosaic
of
the
arts
and
the
incredible
people
working
to
bring
them
to
life
.
Of
course
,
not
all
art
is
created
equal
.
Looking
through
some
old
notes
I
took
during
an
arts
criticism
Recess
training
session
freshman
year
,
I
stumbled
across
a
quote
I
wrote
down
Sometimes
art
sucks
,
and
someone
needs
to
say
so
.
It’s
true
where
you
can
find
art
,
you
can
usually
find
criticism
of
it
.
But
,
as
some
of
our
esteemed
editors
pointed
out
a
few
months
ago
,
isn’t
taking
the
time
to
criticize
something
,
to
weigh
its
merits
against
its
shortcomings
,
a
form
of
love
for
the
greater
art
form
?
I
am
constantly
in
awe
of
my
fellow
writers’
abilities
to
comb
through
an
album
or
film
and
delve
into
its
true
meaning
,
or
the
mechanics
that
hold
it
all
together
,
and
come
out
with
a
balanced
opinion
of
its
value
in
a
greater
context
.
And
criticism
doesn’t
only
apply
to
artists
who
will
,
in
all
likelihood
,
never
open
up
a
student
newspaper
in
North
Carolina
.
It
applies
to
the
institutions
that
hold
Duke
together
,
which
need
to
be
held
to
the
highest
standard
.
It
isn’t
enough
to
build
another
giant
glass
box
to
house
arts
programs
;
that
box
needs
to
be
supplemented
with
resources
and
funding
to
support
student
artists
and
the
local
community
.
But
,
for
the
sake
of
fairness
,
it’s
a
start
,
and
I’m
excited
to
see
how
Duke’s
arts
scene
develops
long
after
I’ve
left
.
Any
print
issue
of
the
Chronicle
will
include
criticisms
of
Duke
,
as
well
as
highlights
of
accomplishments
of
Duke
students
and
faculty
and
both
are
well
deserved
.
But
looking
around
301
Flowers
on
any
given
Tuesday
production
night
,
seeing
other
staffers
edit
article
after
article
and
cobble
together
layout
and
accompanying
graphics
and
images
,
it
all
just
feels
like
a
labor
of
love
.
Over
the
weekend
,
13
Yale
professors
announced
that
they
would
be
stepping
down
from
their
positions
at
the
university’s
Ethnicity
,
Race
amp
;
Migration
ER
amp
;
M
program
.
Their
resignations
were
not
the
result
of
scandals
or
misconduct
,
but
rather
the
acts
of
protest
against
Yale’s
alleged
refusal
to
support
both
the
program
and
its
larger
mission
.
Yale
created
the
ER
amp
;
M
program
in
1997
as
an
interdisciplinary
major
,
but
then
neglected
the
program
,
leaving
it
without
an
official
department
,
autonomy
or
adequate
funding
.
In
the
words
of
one
of
the
program’s
former
professors
,
ER
amp
;
M
has
essentially
been
sustained
by
voluntary
labor
for
the
past
20
years
.
The
issues
that
exist
in
academia
,
specifically
when
it
comes
to
inequality
,
are
vast
and
deeply
entrenched
into
the
foundations
of
our
academic
institutions
.
This
includes
the
unseen
and
uncompensated
obligations
and
responsibilities
taken
on
by
professors
,
graduate
student
and
staff
members
from
marginalized
backgrounds
.
Consistent
calls
for
creating
more
inclusive
spaces
in
college
for
students
from
marginalized
identities
can
be
found
across
numerous
universities
as
they
increasingly
diversify
.
Most
frequent
among
these
demands
are
pushes
to
increase
diversity
among
faculty
to
more
accurately
reflect
the
student
body
.
The
mere
presence
of
more
black
and
brown
faculty
on
campuses
alone
can
drastically
change
how
welcome
students
of
color
feel
in
their
respective
departments
.
However
,
in
this
role
,
faculty
of
color
and
LGBTQ
faculty
are
also
expected
to
take
on
a
set
of
responsibilities
outside
of
their
job
description
.
These
obligations
often
take
the
form
of
serving
as
mentors
and
confidants
for
undergraduates
with
similar
backgrounds
or
identities
.
While
these
responsibilities
can
take
up
a
large
portion
of
faculty
members’
time
and
mental
capacity
,
there
is
no
additional
compensation
for
the
professors
who
end
up
taking
on
this
labor
.
Additionally
,
often
their
obligations
to
students
are
overlooked
when
being
reviewed
for
career
advancement
.
Over
the
course
of
their
careers
,
these
professors
go
unsalaried
for
the
time
that
they
dedicate
to
their
institutions
.
In
some
cases
,
the
conflict
between
a
faculty
member’s
identity
and
the
institution
which
they
are
meant
to
support
can
even
negatively
impact
their
chances
of
promotion
.
Faculty
who
sign
onto
petitions
or
support
movements
that
seek
equality
for
students
that
belong
to
similar
marginalized
identities
then
have
to
deal
with
the
potential
blowback
from
speaking
out
.
And
,
though
the
tenure
system
is
designed
to
protect
faculty
who
take
stands
on
issues
,
nbsp
;
the
university
is
increasingly
turning
away
from
tenure
track
or
nbsp
;
regular
rank
faculty
and
looking
more
to
non
regular
rank
faculty
,
who
face
even
more
precarity
.
Faculty
of
color
and
LGBTQ
faculty
are
entangled
in
a
series
of
limbos
,
having
to
exist
as
support
systems
for
students
while
not
making
themselves
a
target
for
administrative
backlash
and
as
a
mentor
,
while
also
knowing
that
this
time
spent
could
be
put
towards
the
narrow
definitions
of
labor
that
academia
rewards
and
deems
valuable
.
Both
of
these
dynamics
play
out
on
campus
at
Duke
.
Raymond
Gavins
,
the
first
African
American
to
join
Duke’s
history
faculty
,
was
celebrated
for
serving
as
a
mentor
to
countless
graduate
and
undergraduate
students
alike
in
a
career
that
has
spanned
forty
five
years
at
Duke
.
We
paint
these
actions
as
acts
of
generosity
more
than
we
analyze
the
structures
that
made
this
type
of
mentorship
necessary
for
the
preservation
and
advancement
of
black
students
at
Duke
.
The
same
can
be
said
of
the
efforts
of
faculty
members
,
students
and
staff
who
are
involved
in
trying
to
get
an
Asian
American
studies
program
set
up
at
Duke
;
those
fighting
for
representation
for
Native
communities
among
faculty
and
staff
or
those
who
took
over
the
Allen
building
in
1969
in
order
to
fight
for
the
creation
of
an
African
American
studies
department
,
among
other
necessary
demands
.
Individuals
at
Duke
and
across
the
country
are
engaged
in
a
constant
struggle
for
programs
that
reflect
the
backgrounds
and
interests
of
students
,
as
well
as
faculty
who
can
relate
to
the
lived
experiences
of
marginalized
students
on
this
campus
.
We
cannot
forget
,
however
,
to
also
push
for
corresponding
compensation
for
faculty
members
who
reflect
the
overlooked
commitments
they
inevitably
take
on
.
While
it
may
be
too
late
for
the
Ethnicity
,
Race
amp
;
Migration
program
at
Yale
,
it
is
our
obligation
to
continue
to
fight
for
fair
faculty
treatment
and
review
for
those
who
take
on
the
extra
labor
of
supporting
the
most
vulnerable
and
underserved
students
.
Four
years
ago
,
I
believed
I
was
destined
to
be
a
sports
journalist
.
I
would
spend
my
after
school
hours
poring
through
Duke’s
journalism
options
,
and
when
I
first
arrived
on
campus
in
2015
,
I
prioritized
signing
up
for
the
Chronicle’s
sports
section
.
The
Chronicle
soon
became
my
only
non
academic
commitment
,
and
I
devoted
so
much
of
my
free
time
trying
to
assert
myself
within
the
sports
section
.
I
still
remember
the
thrill
of
seeing
my
first
blog
post
no
matter
how
much
it
had
to
be
edited
most
of
it
publicized
on
Twitter
and
Facebook
.
I
also
remember
my
first
article
as
a
beat
writer
and
my
piece
covering
the
men’s
basketball
team
following
Coach
K’s
return
from
surgery
.
At
some
point
in
my
first
year
,
though
,
I
realized
that
I
didn't
have
the
same
zeal
I
once
had
for
journalism
.
That’s
not
at
all
a
reflection
of
my
experience
writing
for
the
Chronicle
.
It
was
just
that
,
for
me
,
writing
had
become
a
chore
.
I
knew
that
there
were
still
some
aspects
that
I
thoroughly
enjoyed
after
all
,
there’s
a
reason
I
was
initially
so
drawn
to
it
in
the
first
place
.
But
it
was
difficult
to
isolate
what
I
liked
and
didn’t
like
about
writing
,
and
subsequently
,
how
I
should
move
forward
for
my
next
three
years
.
Finally
,
I
realized
that
I
loved
the
creative
aspect
of
journalism
,
rather
than
journalism
itself
.
I
cherished
,
and
continue
to
revere
,
the
opportunity
to
convey
my
interpretation
of
any
event
,
profile
,
or
feature
story
.
After
isolating
my
thirst
for
creativity
from
the
rest
of
the
process
,
it
became
easy
to
choose
my
major
in
statistical
science
.
With
statistics
,
I
can
be
just
as
creative
in
asking
questions
this
time
with
datasets
instead
of
people
.
So
why
did
I
stay
with
the
Chronicle
?
There’s
a
multitude
of
explanations
finishing
something
I
started
,
not
wanting
to
let
others
down
,
making
lifelong
connections
and
meeting
people
I
otherwise
wouldn’t
have
crossed
paths
with
,
and
so
many
more
.
But
there’s
another
one
that
for
some
reason
,
I
could
never
seem
to
shake
.
It's
not
as
if
the
other
ones
are
invalid
or
don't
pertain
to
me
they
do
.
But
there's
only
one
principle
reason
.
It’s
why
I
have
remained
involved
in
the
Chronicle
as
an
associate
editor
,
columnist
,
beat
writer
and
social
media
editor
for
the
past
three
years
,
and
have
devoted
myself
to
my
first
extracurricular
at
Duke
.
I
wanted
to
make
seven
year
old
me
proud
.
I
wrote
my
college
essay
on
my
passion
for
sports
writing
and
the
importance
of
truth
.
It
had
been
something
I
had
been
subconsciously
and
then
consciously
working
toward
since
I
was
seven
years
old
when
I
would
memorize
all
of
the
baseball
statistics
on
the
back
page
of
the
New
York
Times’
sports
section
and
then
beg
my
father
to
quiz
me
.
I
thought
about
that
seven
year
old
a
lot
when
trying
to
figure
out
my
role
within
the
Chronicle
.
I
sought
a
balance
between
other
academic
pursuits
,
outside
passions
and
the
commitment
to
sports
reporting
that
I
made
to
myself
so
many
years
ago
.
Yes
,
at
seven
I
was
more
focused
on
playing
in
the
MLB
,
but
as
I
grew
older
,
I
focused
my
efforts
solely
on
journalism
.

It
was
not
that
I
thought
I
would
have
wasted
all
that
time
I
spent
hammering
obscure
sports
knowledge
into
my
brain
,
and
it
wasn’t
that
I
could
not
let
go
of
the
past
I
just
wanted
to
make
the
younger
version
of
myself
smile
if
he
were
able
to
peer
into
the
future
14
years
later
.
I
know
it
may
seem
like
a
ridiculous
reason
to
continue
committing
myself
to
something
I
was
not
going
to
pursue
in
the
future
.
But
not
everything
has
to
be
done
with
one
eye
on
the
future
,
and
little
by
little
,
I
started
to
enjoy
writing
again
.
I
began
taking
pride
in
the
little
things
that
don’t
necessarily
pop
out
when
sorting
through
my
now
226
bylines
,
especially
the
work
I
have
put
in
covering
a
struggling
women’s
lacrosse
team
the
past
four
years
and
this
column
that
received
a
decent
amount
of
flack
.
This
vision
of
my
younger
self
made
every
part
of
the
process
so
much
better
.
That’s
not
to
say
anything
about
writers
who
write
to
tell
stories
that’s
an
amazing
reason
to
report
too
.
But
for
me
,
to
be
unapologetically
Benjamin
Aaron
Feder
,
I
needed
to
isolate
the
reason
for
continuing
to
do
something
that
on
its
own
was
none
too
enjoyable
for
me
.
And
for
that
,
I
have
to
thank
my
seven
year
old
self
.
I
have
a
confession
to
make
in
my
head
,
I
use
the
word
pop
instead
of
soda
when
I
see
someone
grab
a
Mountain
Dew
or
when
I
pass
the
Coca
Cola
bottles
in
the
campus
store
.
It’s
a
part
of
me
;
I
have
been
saying
it
for
as
long
as
I
remember
,
and
until
I
left
high
school
,
I
never
thought
much
about
it
.
Before
coming
to
Duke
,
I
never
realized
that
it
was
weird
to
say
pop
to
refer
to
the
category
of
sweet
drinks
that
students
add
to
their
alcohol
to
mask
the
taste
.
After
one
of
my
friends
caught
me
saying
it
and
,
mostly
in
jest
,
called
my
choice
of
words
gross
,
I’ve
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
what
I
say
when
referring
to
pop
and
rarely
say
the
word
out
loud
.
But
after
considering
why
I
stopped
saying
it
,
I’ve
realized
that
pop
is
more
than
a
unique
linguistic
feature
from
my
childhood
and
from
my
home
of
rural
Pennsylvania
it’s
a
cultural
tradition
that
defines
the
place
that
I
was
born
in
.
I
grew
up
in
a
town
in
Western
Pennsylvania
that
is
home
to
between
700
and
1000
people
.
Yes
,
you
read
that
correctly
.
Seven
hundred
.
My
next
door
neighbors
are
Amish
and
have
a
woodworking
business
.
The
family
that
lives
across
the
street
has
a
patch
of
woods
where
they
hunt
deer
.
One
of
my
soccer
coaches
growing
up
was
a
farmer
,
and
his
sons
both
played
on
teams
with
me
,
drove
trucks
and
worked
harder
than
almost
anyone
I
knew
.
This
is
a
small
town
.
Growing
up
amongst
the
farms
,
mills
,
Amish
families
and
stalks
of
corn
that
mark
the
Pennsylvania
landscape
,
enabled
me
to
learn
some
things
that
people
from
other
places
would
never
know
.
I
learned
how
to
avoid
neighbors’
guard
dogs
while
running
and
how
to
take
care
of
different
types
of
farm
animals
.
I
learned
to
ride
a
four
wheeler
also
known
as
a
quad
ATV
if
you
don’t
know
the
PA
lingo
,
how
to
survive
without
air
conditioning
in
an
old
farmhouse
,
how
to
garden
and
that
fries
with
vinegar
are
actually
delicious
.
But
unless
you
are
very
close
to
me
at
Duke
,
you’ve
likely
never
heard
me
say
a
word
about
most
of
those
things
.
Why
?
Those
are
things
that
set
me
apart
at
Duke
,
but
not
things
that
Duke
students
value
when
they
say
they
value
diversity
.
If
I
talk
about
the
fact
that
I
am
from
a
small
rural
town
in
Western
Pennsylvania
,
I
am
associated
with
things
that
most
Duke
students
look
down
upon
with
being
poor
,
with
being
a
redneck
,
with
all
of
the
preconceived
notions
that
primarily
wealthy
urban
and
suburban
students
have
when
they
think
about
rural
places
.
Because
of
those
reasons
,
or
because
fitting
in
at
Duke
often
means
pretending
I
come
from
a
major
metropolitan
area
or
,
as
we
Duke
students
like
to
say
,
Just
outside
of
insert
city
name
here
I
do
not
often
discuss
my
hometown
unless
we
are
already
friends
.
For
those
same
reasons
,
I
do
not
tell
people
that
some
of
my
most
cherished
pets
growing
up
were
my
goats
,
or
that
I’ve
run
through
cornfields
at
night
or
accompanied
my
mom
to
a
deer
processing
shop
think
a
butcher
shop
,
but
a
lot
more
in
your
face
.
Because
prevailing
Duke
culture
or
what
is
deemed
socially
acceptable
is
being
from
Connecticut
or
California
and
looking
,
acting
and
especially
speaking
,
the
part
,
I’ve
stayed
quiet
.
Because
it’s
not
cool
,
and
because
it’s
a
pain
to
explain
why
I
use
different
language
than
my
peers
,
I
try
to
remember
to
say
soda
,
or
avoid
saying
anything
when
I
can
.
But
I
refuse
to
stay
silent
on
the
idea
that
what
is
cool
is
being
or
pretending
to
be
from
WASPy
Northeastern
suburbia
or
one
of
the
wealthy
Bay
Area
suburbs
.
I
do
not
think
that
trading
in
one
of
your
own
linguistic
idiosyncrasies
or
other
harmless
cultural
practices
for
acceptance
is
something
we
as
Duke
students
should
support
,
whether
we
are
from
the
middle
of
nowhere
or
from
Austin
,
Texas
or
from
another
country
entirely
.
If
we
want
a
more
inclusive
not
just
diverse
social
environment
,
we
should
try
not
to
subscribe
to
stereotypes
,
we
should
not
tease
our
friends
for
parts
of
themselves
that
are
both
harmless
and
hallmarks
of
their
upbringings
,
and
we
should
end
the
stigma
of
saying
pop
.
Back
in
January
,
I
opened
an
Instagram
story
posted
by
the
sorority
I
used
to
be
a
member
of
and
my
stomach
dropped
.
It
was
a
boomerang
of
several
chapter
members
with
a
caption
about
being
excited
for
the
last
round
of
recruitment
and
,
I
watched
as
,
dead
center
,
two
women
kissed
on
the
lips
and
then
laughed
in
a
nauseating
loop
.
The
dictionary
defines
cultural
appropriation
as
the
unacknowledged
or
inappropriate
adoption
of
the
customs
,
practices
,
ideas
,
etc
.
of
one
people
or
society
by
members
of
another
and
typically
more
dominant
people
or
society
.
It’s
being
able
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
certain
identities
and
cultures
without
having
to
face
the
discrimination
that
comes
from
actually
holding
those
identities
.
In
the
case
of
queer
appropriation
,
it
can
erase
the
voices
and
identities
of
actual
queer
people
,
exploit
queer
culture
while
perpetuating
anti
queer
prejudice
,
and
even
directly
denigrate
members
of
the
queer
community
.
One
example
I
see
with
aggravating
frequency
is
a
photo
posted
to
social
media
of
platonic
friends
accompanied
by
a
caption
about
how
she
is
in
love
with
her
girlfriend
or
wife
.
I
understand
that
it
is
likely
meant
in
good
fun
,
but
when
I
know
women
who
would
be
kicked
out
of
their
homes
for
posting
a
photo
kissing
their
actual
girlfriend
,
it
doesn’t
seem
very
funny
to
me
.
By
all
means
,
express
the
love
you
have
for
your
friends
on
social
media
.
However
,
if
you
joke
about
being
in
a
queer
relationship
when
you
are
not
,
I
am
never
going
to
feel
comfortable
talking
to
you
about
women
I’m
actually
dating
.
We
seldom
get
the
opportunity
to
unpack
the
LGBTQIA
excluding
culture
perpetuated
in
the
Greek
environment
.
I’ve
seen
heterosexual
identifying
women
in
sororities
kiss
one
another
as
a
joke
while
simultaneously
expressing
their
discomfort
with
queer
sisters
in
actual
sexual
and
romantic
relationships
.
I’ve
heard
of
the
fear
that
wearing
braids
and
flannels
during
a
round
of
recruitment
would
make
the
chapter
look
like
the
lesbian
sorority
.
Then
there’s
the
My
Tie
party
,
where
your
blind
date
finds
you
by
the
tie
that
you’re
wearing
tie
.
While
Greek
life
maintains
that
the
purpose
of
fraternity
sorority
mixers
goes
beyond
meeting
romantic
and
sexual
partners
,
sororities
whose
members
indubitably
have
friends
across
chapters
do
not
host
parties
with
one
another
.
Of
course
,
these
are
just
a
few
examples
,
and
thus
do
not
include
other
negative
experiences
in
sororities
,
as
well
as
in
fraternities
,
SLGs
,
and
additional
affiliations
.
I
also
want
to
recognize
that
many
queer
students
have
been
fortunate
to
find
affinity
groups
and
supportive
allies
within
their
organizations
.
If
this
doesn’t
seem
like
a
big
issue
to
you
,
or
if
you
haven’t
considered
how
you
may
have
inadvertently
made
your
peers
feel
uncomfortable
,
unwelcome
,
and
even
unsafe
,
I
invite
you
to
reflect
on
allyship
and
the
impact
of
your
actions
.
You
don’t
need
to
fully
understand
something
in
order
to
empathize
with
others
and
make
minor
adjustments
that
take
major
steps
toward
inclusivity
.
Microaggressions
have
long
lasting
consequences
for
marginalized
individuals
,
and
no
one
should
have
to
feel
like
they
need
to
conceal
their
authentic
identity
within
a
group
that
is
supposed
to
be
supportive
and
empowering
.
Last
year
when
I
was
working
on
Greek
Ally
Week
programming
,
a
gender
non
conforming
student
asked
me
if
they
are
welcome
in
fraternities
or
sororities
.
I
responded
that
the
system
inherently
perpetuates
the
gender
binary
and
cisheteronormativity
,
thus
making
it
unwelcome
to
trans
and
GNC
students
simply
by
its
structure
.
We
also
know
that
Greek
life
is
exclusive
for
a
whole
range
of
other
reasons
,
including
high
cost
and
lack
of
racial
and
ethnic
diversity
.
Social
change
is
achieved
at
multiple
levels
.
I
believe
in
fighting
for
the
big
picture
eradicating
these
oppressive
systems
while
concurrently
treating
symptoms
by
supporting
current
LGBTQIA
students
in
Greek
life
,
as
it
remains
omnipresent
on
campus
.
Our
programming
provides
space
for
LGBTQIA
students
in
fraternities
and
sororities
of
all
councils
to
confidentially
connect
and
discuss
their
experiences
,
as
well
as
the
opportunity
for
other
folks
to
learn
about
how
these
issues
manifest
.
Our
Ally
201
training
goes
beyond
introductions
and
definitions
to
provide
an
open
discussion
about
intersectionality
and
allyship
beyond
Greek
life
,
interrogating
the
implications
of
a
binary
,
heteronormative
system
.
I
envision
the
goal
of
Greek
Ally
Week
as
pushing
the
Greek
and
broader
Duke
community
to
be
more
cognizant
of
LGBTQIA
issues
and
more
supportive
of
all
individuals
.
Greek
life
as
a
whole
is
certainly
not
a
welcoming
space
for
LGBTQIA
folks
,
especially
not
for
trans
and
nonbinary
students
,
and
while
I
hope
we
can
change
that
,
I
also
know
that
a
week
long
initiative
is
not
going
to
radically
transform
a
historically
exclusive
institution
nor
does
this
one
area
of
advocacy
work
have
the
capacity
to
fully
challenge
all
of
the
other
discriminatory
aspects
of
Greek
life
.
In
the
meantime
,
I
believe
that
if
just
one
LGBTQIA
Greek
affiliated
person
feels
affirmed
because
of
our
efforts
,
or
one
chapter
president
initiates
an
inclusive
organizational
change
,
then
Greek
Ally
Week
is
not
in
vain
.
Get
lost
.
Get
lost
in
your
classes
,
get
lost
in
your
extracurriculars
.
Just
get
lost
,
and
sooner
or
later
all
the
dots
will
connect
.
That
was
the
advice
that
the
alumni
speaker
gave
to
at
least
one
third
of
the
Class
of
2020
myself
included
at
Blue
Devil
Days
three
years
ago
.
It
stuck
with
me
,
immortalized
in
a
cheesy
Instagram
post
with
a
Chapel
photo
after
I
decided
I
was
coming
to
Duke
.
I
got
lost
the
first
time
I
was
trying
to
find
301
Flowers
if
you’ve
ever
tried
to
find
our
office
,
you
know
what
I
mean
but
it
took
me
about
five
minutes
from
walking
through
that
door
to
know
that
The
Chronicle
was
what
I
wanted
to
get
lost
in
.
Earlier
this
month
,
I
got
to
see
the
dots
connect
.
It
was
a
little
after
2
a
.
m
.
in
mid
April
and
a
group
of
Chronicle
staffers
was
huddled
next
to
the
printing
press
at
Triangle
Web
Printing
,
where
the
paper
is
printed
two
times
per
week
.
We
watched
as
the
printing
staff
loaded
each
metal
proof
into
the
press
,
as
the
ink
flowed
onto
newsprint
in
bright
hues
.
I
couldn’t
wipe
the
goofiest
smile
off
my
face
or
stop
myself
from
saying
multiple
times
,
undoubtedly
to
the
mild
annoyance
of
my
friends
,
how
awesome
this
was
.
After
a
year
of
leading
a
student
staff
responsible
for
making
the
paper
twice
weekly
,
I
felt
a
swelling
sense
of
pride
at
watching
the
magical
step
of
text
boxes
on
a
computer
turning
into
ink
on
newsprint
although
It
felt
slightly
less
magical
when
I
nearly
slept
through
a
class
presentation
later
that
morning
.
At
the
most
basic
level
,
student
journalism
matters
because
colleges
need
to
be
held
accountable
and
people
need
information
to
make
decisions
about
their
lives
.
But
it
more
than
matters
it’s
essential
because
there
are
stories
that
need
to
be
told
,
moments
that
need
to
be
seared
into
institutional
memory
and
voices
that
need
to
be
elevated
.
And
while
those
are
meaningful
mores
,
they
feel
distant
at
3
a
.
m
.
when
school
assignments
are
piling
up
,
the
layout
for
the
next
day’s
print
edition
seems
interminably
unfittable
and
your
paper
straw
has
become
a
soggy
stick
in
your
iced
coffee
.
In
those
moments
,
it’s
not
the
high
ideals
of
the
fourth
estate
that
drive
you
.
It’s
the
handful
of
others
still
in
the
office
,
studying
or
culling
the
paper
for
errors
,
that
pushes
you
to
get
the
thing
done
.
That’s
why
this
is
not
a
love
letter
to
the
importance
of
student
journalism
or
the
office
space
located
in
301
Flowers
although
I
challenge
you
to
find
a
better
spot
on
campus
but
to
the
people
who
bring
it
and
our
paper
to
life
.
The
Chronicle
is
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts
because
it’s
the
product
of
hours
of
sometimes
thankless
labor
by
students
balancing
their
university
lives
with
journalism
.
It’s
about
something
bigger
than
any
individual
one
of
us
,
because
it’s
the
proud
product
of
all
of
us
.
When
The
Chronicle
writes
something
,
it
reaches
thousands
of
people
in
print
and
is
offered
up
to
our
half
a
million
monthly
online
viewers
.
We’re
the
first
draft
of
this
University’s
history
.
With
that
comes
power
and
deep
responsibility
.
We
don’t
take
it
lightly
.
But
why
does
it
matter
,
and
why
do
we
pour
hours
of
our
lives
during
our
time
at
Duke
into
this
endeavor
?
We
held
the
administration
accountable
when
it
told
housekeepers
they
would
have
to
re
bid
for
shifts
.
We
told
the
stories
of
two
women
who
said
they
were
sexually
harassed
by
a
professor
.
We
also
followed
our
men’s
basketball
team
to
Maui
and
shared
students’
favorite
recipes
.

he
thought

in
the

I’ve

But
I’ll
also
remember
former

sprinting
a
circle
around
the

as
we
all
cried

screamed

,
and
the

of

,
and

drove
a
few
minutes
from
campus
to
test
their
luck
at
an
escape

The

is
occasional
frisbee
on
the

before
production
shifts
,
and
late
nights
to
study
for
exams
after
editing
stories

It’s
dropping
everything
in
the
middle
of
the
day
for
breaking
news
,
and
it’s
a
staffer’s
mom
mailing
cross
stitches
halfway
across
the
country
for
us
to
hang
in
the
office
.
It’s
the
best
thing
I’ve
ever
been
a
part
of
.
Former
Editor
in
Chief
Alison
Stuebe
described

Looking
back
,
I
doubt
that
anything
else
would
have
forced
me
to
scrutinize
so
closely
who
I
am
and
who
I
want
to
become
.
I
guess
that's
what
I
came
to
college
to
learn
.
I’m
so
glad
that
,
as
a
naive
first
year
,
I
stumbled
into
301
Flowers
.
The
students
that
pour
their
hearts
into
this
paper
have
become
family
during
the
last
three
years
,
and
I
wouldn’t
trade
my
time
here
for
anything
.
I
hope
everyone
has
the
chance
to
get
lost
in
something
that
gives
you
as
much
meaning
and
joy
as
The
Chronicle
has
given
to
me
this
year
.
The
dots
,
I
promise
,
will
connect
.
One
night
during
my
first
year
,
I
called
my
mother
in
the
middle
of
a
breakdown
.
With
tears
rolling
down
my
cheeks
,
I
told
her
that
a
new
mental
illness
was
destroying
my
life
,
and
that
I
felt
utterly
helpless
to
stop
it
.
I
know
how
to
be
anxious
,
Mom
.
But
I
don’t
know
how
to
be
depressed
.
I’ve
been
dealing
with
anxiety
pretty
much
my
whole
life
.
I
started
going
to
therapy
when
I
was
fourteen
,
started
taking
meds
when
I
was
fifteen
.
And
I
can’t
lie
,
it
was
horrible
for
a
while
waking
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
with
sharp
,
twisting
pains
in
your
stomach
,
and
then
mediating
the
racing
thoughts
pounding
at
the
walls
of
your
skull
every
hour
of
the
day
.
But
over
time
,
I
learned
how
to
cope
with
my
anxiety
.
I
learned
the
things
I
could
do
when
I
was
feeling
extra
anxious
,
like
deep
breathing
,
exercising
,
and
journaling
.
Little
by
little
,
I
started
to
feel
in
control
again
.
Depression
is
another
animal
entirely
.
When
I
fell
into
an
intense
depression
my
first
year
,
I
quickly
realized
that
learning
how
to
manage
it
wasn’t
going
to
be
as
straightforward
as
before
.
Learning
requires
doing
and
with
depression
,
doing
again
joy
,
pain
,
passion
,
all
of
it
.
Most
of
all
,
I
needed
to
feel
love
,
and
I
needed
to
feel
loved
.
So
I
turned
to
my
friends
and
family
.
I
went
to
places
I
knew
my
friends
would
be
and
forced
myself
to
sit
there
while
they
coaxed
me
out
of
my
shell
.
I
called
my
parents
almost
every
day
and
listened
to
them
telling
me
they
loved
me
.
I
started
to
realize
that
their
happiness
mattered
more
to
me
than
my
depression
ever
could
.
Finally
and
this
was
the
kicker
I
realized
I
had
to
give
that
same
love
to
myself
.
It
felt
idiotic
at
first
,
telling
myself
I
liked
the
way
I
looked
in
the
mirror
even
when
I
didn’t
,
feeding
myself
empty
praises
,
and
repeating
cheesy
affirmations
over
and
over
.
But
as
ridiculous
as
I
thought
those
practices
were
,
they
became
the
most
important
part
of
it
all
.
When
I
actively
loved
the
people
and
the
world
around
me
,
I
could
feel
content
.
When
I
loved
myself
,
I
could
feel
happy
.
Now
I’m
happier
than
I’ve
ever
been
.
And
let
me
tell
you
happiness
is
criminally
underrated
.

If
you’re
reading
this
amidst
feelings
of
hopelessness
,
I
want
you
to
know
that
you
are
not
alone
.
But
more
than
that
,
I
want
you
to
know
that
even
if
you
think
you’re
a
lost
cause
,
you
will
never
be
too
far
gone
.
You
might
be
depressed
to
varying
degrees
your
entire
life
,
and
that’s
okay
.
It
may
just
be
your
neurological
predisposition
.
But
that
doesn’t
mean
your
mental
illness
is
entirely
beyond
your
control
.
Learning
to
manage
your
depression
is
painstaking
and
tedious
,
but
it
possible
and
it
is
more
than
worth
it
.
Over
the
past
two
weeks
,
Southeastern
Africa
and
the
Midwestern
United
States
have
grappled
with
the
aftermath
of
two
severe
storms
.
States
of
emergency
have
been
declared
in
Iowa
,
Wisconsin
and
Nebraska
after
heavy
wind
,
rain
and
snow
devastated
entire
towns
during
a
mid
March
bomb
cyclone
.
Several
people
have
died
as
a
result
of
the
storm
and
over
one
million
acres
of
farmland
has
been
impacted
.
Nebraska
was
hit
the
hardest
and
state
officials
have
estimated
the
cost
of
the
damage
at
around
1
.
3
billion
.
It
took
days
for
the
Nebraska
Department
of
Transportation
to
begin
certifying
some
of
the
flood
damaged
roads
as
passable
.
Iowa
has
also
reported
damages
to
freshwater
treatment
plants
,
leaving
many
residents
without
clean
water
.
Meanwhile
,
in
Mozambique
,
Zimbabwe
and
Malawi
,
Cyclone
Idai
is
said
to
be
responsible
for
over
400
deaths
after
over
two
feet
of
rain
fell
in
less
than
a
week
.
The
storm
is
estimated
to
be
the
worst
in
the
history
of
the
Southern
Hemisphere
,
with
Reuters
reporting
that
over
2
million
people
may
have
been
affected
.
In
Mozambique
alone
,
more
than
400
,
000
people
are
estimated
to
have
been
displaced
by
the
massive
flooding
and
damage
to
homes
.
These
concurrent
tragedies
remind
us
of
two
increasingly
inescapable
realities
about
our
rapidly
deteriorating
environment
.
First
,
the
progression
of
climate
change
is
growing
in
severity
.
Second
,
the
disastrous
effects
are
being
borne
disproportionately
by
rural
communities
and
the
Global
South
.
reported
back
in
January
that
oceans
have
been
warming
at
a
rate
that
is
on
average
40
percent
faster
than
the
trajectory
estimated
five
years
previously
.
The
results
of
this
accelerated
warming
are
severe
.
Coral
reefs
are
expected
to
sustain
even
further
damage
;
coastal
flooding
is
expected
to
become
more
frequent
;
and
intense
storms
such
as
Hurricanes
Harvey
and
Florence
are
expected
to
become
commonplace
,
if
they
haven’t
already
.
It’s
hard
not
to
see
a
connection
between
the
predictions
of
scientists
just
three
months
ago
and
the
devastation
of
these
two
recent
cyclones
.
Yet
another
consequence
of
this
warming
is
unprecedented
levels
of
displaced
people
,
a
burden
again
disproportionately
present
in
the
Global
South
.
The
reasons
for
these
discrepancies
,
however
,
are
no
more
natural
than
the
origins
of
the
cyclones
that
caused
the
destruction
in
the
first
place
.
Violence
and
disaster
are
not
allocated
equally
they
are
distributed
along
the
lines
of
colonial
history
,
regional
poverty
and
intentionally
disjointed
geographic
development
.
Yet
,
contemporary
geopolitical
solutions
to
the
issue
of
a
changing
climate
have
disproportionately
focused
on
shaming
individual
nations
or
poor
populations
for
their
emissions
,
devoid
of
historical
context
of
conquest
that
complicates
the
picture
substantially
.
Furthermore
,
wealthy
nations
like
the
United
States
have
consistently
pushed
to
consider
only
current
levels
of
emissions
when
deciding
responsibility
of
individual
countries
,
rather
than
looking
at
past
trends
which
would
implicate
them
directly
in
the
current
crisis
.
There
is
an
undeniable
connection
between
the
history
of
colonialist
economic
subjugation
in
the
Global
South
and
the
level
of
infrastructural
damage
and
mass
displacement
from
ecological
disasters
.
The
staggering
income
inequality
in
the
United
States
has
also
produced
circumstances
in
which
the
poor
are
destined
to
drown
in
the
floods
caused
by
the
rich
.
Climate
change
is
an
issue
of
colonialist
violence
and
class
war
.
The
wealth
extracted
from
countries
like
Mozambique
enriched
now
post
industrial
nations
,
allowing
them
to
poison
the
Earth
and
leave
former
colonies
to
suffer
the
consequences
.
Poor
Americans
are
faced
with
a
looming
horizon
of
increasingly
uninhabitable
homes
while
the
wealthy
capitalize
on
the
wreckage
.
The
next
few
decades
will
certainly
be
characterized
by
storms
of
unprecedented
intensity
and
the
type
of
destruction
as
experienced
in
Southeastern
Africa
and
the
Midwestern
United
States
this
month
.
Those
effects
will
,
of
course
,
continue
to
be
be
felt
disproportionately
by
certain
geographies
.
There’s
no
uplifting
call
to
action
to
give
or
reassuring
conclusion
that
could
cull
the
unimaginably
catastrophic
future
we
face
.
This
is
a
reality
we
should
acknowledge
fully
,
as
difficult
as
that
may
be
.
Duke
students
will
move
into
Krzyzewskiville
Saturday
for
the
start
of
black
tenting
.
We’ve
finished
that
most
sacred
rite
in
the
Duke
year
men’s
basketball
.
But
never
women’s
.
And
also
never
any
other
sport
even
though
they
work
hard
too
.
For
a
senior
,
it’s
a
bittersweet
moment
.
The
last
time
seeing
throngs
of
people
descend
on
Cameron
,
the
last
time
seeing
people
spend
a
month
living
in
a
tent
to
see
a
two
hour
game
,
and
the
last
time
realizing
how
many
hours
we
have
poured
out
while
achieving
nothing
more
than
our
own
amusement
.
On
February
20
,
Duke
lost
to
UNC
at
home
.
Cameron
was
packed
,
every
common
room
filled
,
and
campus
deserted
wherever
there
was
not
a
television
.
We
care
a
lot
about
basketball
.
On
February
21
,
we
learned
that
48
percent
of
undergraduate
women
are
sexually
assaulted
while
on
Duke’s
campus
.
And
yet
those
same
crowds
who
descended
to
watch
people
their
own
age
play
a
game
did
not
find
time
to
descend
on
the
Allen
Building
to
ask
the
administration
what
how
they’ll
exercise
leadership
on
this
problem
.
We
mustn’t
care
very
much
about
sexual
assault
.
We
cheer
on
the
game
with
a
roar
.
We
try
to
fix
life
with
a
murmur
.
Imagine
how
much
good
we
could
do
,
if
we
treated
any
one
thing
in
the
menagerie
of
inhumanities
on
this
campus
the
way
we
treat
basketball
.
On
the
average
game
day
,
we’ll
spend
hours
standing
outside
to
get
the
chance
to
spend
hours
standing
inside
.
Just
standing
.
For
the
Game
Day
of
All
Game
Days
,
we’ll
spend
no
small
pile
on
a
tent
and
the
appropriate
accessories
,
spend
hours
coordinating
who
will
be
in
the
tent
and
when
,
spend
over
a
month
living
in
said
tent
,
and
schedule
our
lives
around
living
in
that
tent
,
and
for
what
?
To
watch
a
two
hour
game
.
I
have
never
seen
us
spend
one
whole
month
addressing
any
of
the
problems
on
this
campus
.
I
have
never
seen
us
care
about
real
harm
done
in
real
life
as
we
do
about
this
game
.
The
sexual
assault
report
?
We
made
it
just
over
two
weeks
between
the
first
report
and
the
last
op
ed
.
The
rates
of
anxiety
,
depression
,
and
suicidality
?
We’ve
been
self
medicating
with
our
usual
combination
of
partying
,
exclusion
,
and
degradation
.
That
business
about
not
letting
students
speak
their
own
language
?
There’s
about
a
week
and
a
half
between
when
the
coverage
starts
,
and
when
the
coverage
stops
.
If
you
wonder
why
our
administrators
do
not
take
these
problems
seriously
,
it
is
because
we
do
not
take
these
problems
seriously
.
If
you
wonder
why
these
problems
persist
it
is
because
we
allow
them
to
persist
.
Bad
times
,
hard
times
this
is
what
people
keep
saying
;
but
live
well
,
and
times
shall
be
good
.
We
are
the
times
Such
as
we
are
,
such
are
the
times
.
St
.
Augustine

we
are

unable
to
our
world
exists
in
our
image
.
We
have
the
Duke
that
we
make
.
There
are
groups
who
know
this
,
and
who
refuse
to
excuse
consistent
personal
failings
as
the
times
.
Duke
Students
and
Workers
Alliance
are
in
their
eighth
month
of
advocacy
for
fair
conditions
.
Groups
like
the
Black
Students’
Alliance
and
Blue
Devils
United
live
in
a
strange
flux
of
steady
advocacy
for
their
members
and
rapid
,
first
response
to
the
worst
of
the
vitriol
we
spew
at
each
other
.
There
are
individuals
on
this
campus
who
make
noise
for
the
issues
.
More
of
us
should
join
them
.
There
is
no
abstract
culture
which
compels
people
to
treat
other
like
objects
.
There
are
individuals
who
commit
assaults
and
individuals
who
fail
to
intervene
.
But
we
still
cheer
loudly
for
our
team
.
There
is
no
Duke
Difference
that
turns
high
school
high
achievers
into
self
loathing
depressives
.
There
are
individuals
who
actively
put
others
down
,
and
individuals
who
do
too
little
to
help
others
up
.
But
we
still
cheer
loudly
for
our
team
.
There
is
no
prejudice
that
exists
outside
of
the
human
mind
.
There
are
individuals
who
choose
bigotry
and
individuals
who
do
not
check
them
.
But
we
still
cheer
loudly
for
our
team
.
When
a
team
loses
a
game
,
we
call
it
heartbreaking
.
When
we
see
our
peers
being
broken
down
,
we
say
nothing
.
We
cheer
for
one
and
dones
.
We
are
silent
toward
anyone
present
for
the
long
four
years
.
None
of
this
is
to
say
that
nothing
good
comes
of
how
we
interact
with
all
things
athletic
.
They’re
a
reason
to
carve
out
time
with
friends
,
to
share
a
common
experience
and
cultivate
bonhomie
.
Not
to
mention
that
these
teams
net
no
small
glory
,
laud
and
honor
,
monetary
and
otherwise
.
I’d
be
a
fool
if
I
thought
that
the
same
experience
I’m
criticizing
is
not
responsible
for
some
part
of
the
shared
identity
that
pushes
us
forward
.
As
a
friend
put
it
,
the
game
is
usually
the
highlight
of
the
tenting
season
,
but
I
wouldn’t
tent
if
I
didn’t
enjoy
spending
time
bonding
with
11
of
my
friends
.
But
she
goes
on
to
say
,
we
want
to
be
the
center
of
attention
,
and
often
our
self
centeredness
comes
at
the
expense
of
our
peers

something
that
often

We

Duke’s
moral
arc
toward
the
good
.
We
were
delighted
to
see
your
April
11
article
,
Duke
joins
higher
education
partnership
to
combat
sexual
harassment
.
We
find
it
ironic
,
however
,
that
this
appeared
two
days
after
published
,
Nearly
a
decade
apart
,
two
women
say
professor
sexually
harassed
them
,
which
outlined
many
of
the
shortcomings
of
how
Duke
has
treated
,
and
still
treats
,
claims
of
sexual
and
other
harassment
.
We
are
distressed
that
President
Price
has
not
yet
answered
letters
of
concern
about
these
issues
,
including
the
public
letter
sent
to
him
by
Professor
Jill
Hicks
Keeton
,
the
open
letter
of
support
for
Professor
Hicks
Keeton
by
her
classmates
who
witnessed
her
abuse
,
or
the
public
statements
by
Ms
.
Lara
Haft
concerning
the
inadequacy
of
institutional
response
to
her
experiences
.
We
are
gratified
that
Duke
has
joined
this
important
initiative
to
combat
sexual
harassment
,
and
look
forward
to
participating
actively
in
the
practical
steps
that
Duke
will
undertake
to
implement
a
true
atmosphere
of
inclusion
.
Most
importantly
,
we
remain
anxious
to
learn
more
about
the
concrete
steps
that
will
be
taken
to
address
issues
in
our
Department
and
throughout
the
University
,
so
that
we
might
view
joining
this
higher
education
partnership
as
more
than
window
dressing
.
Have
you
ever
thought
about
what
it
takes
to
get
a
synthetic
uterus
through
the
TSA
screening
line
at
the
airport
?
Neither
had
we
until
we
handed
our
documentation
to
the
agents
at
RDU
,
scrambling
to
explain
we
were
carrying
bundles
of
pink
gel
and
latex
tubing
in
our
backpacks
.
Before
arriving
at
Duke
,
we
envisioned
our
first
year
would
consist
of
daily
trips
to
Marketplace
,
intense
conversations
with
friends
late
into
the
night
,
and
jam
packed
basketball
games
in
Cameron
.
Like
many
Duke
students
,
we
were
right
to
assume
that
these
events
would
become
staples
of
our
first
two
semesters
.
However
,
we
had
not
yet
realized
that
,
sometimes
,
the
most
memorable
experiences
emerge
at
unexpected
times
,
in
unexpected
places
,
with
unexpected
people
.
While
other
students
were
eased
into
their
college
coursework
,
we
were
catapulted
into
the
engineering
process
in
Pratt’s
new
first
year
design
course
.
Placed
together
on
a
team
based
on
mutual
interests
,
we
were
assigned
a
client
and
were
tasked
with
designing
and
developing
an
accurate
model
of
the
female
abdomen
postpartum
for
use
in
medical
device
testing
.
Following
the
successful
completion
of
the
course
,
we
made
the
decision
to
continue
working
on
our
project
,
this
time
pivoting
to
achieve
a
new
set
of
goals
.
Over
the
past
few
months
,
we
designed
,
prototyped
,
and
presented
a
low
cost
postpartum
hemorrhage
training
simulator
for
use
in
rural
and
low
income
U
.
S
.
hospitals
.
The
simulator
allows
labor
and
delivery
teams
to
practice
the
proper
procedures
to
treat
postpartum
hemorrhage
PPH
at
a
very
low
cost
less
than
100
dollars
.
Given
that
PPH
is
the
leading
cause
of
maternal
mortality
worldwide
,
our
work
was
driven
by
a
desire
to
improve
the
delivery
of
healthcare
here
in
the
United
States
and
to
secure
better
maternal
outcomes
.
Though
we
learned
a
wide
range
of
tangible
skills
and
can
now
spit
off
every
statistic
relevant
to
maternal
mortality
,
we
believe
that
the
most
important
lessons
,
as
shared
below
,
were
learned
beyond
the
bounds
of
a
rubric
.
With
multiple
components
being
completed
simultaneously
,
communication
was
critical
to
the
development
of
our
project
.
Our
sense
of
team
loyalty
became
our
strongest
asset
.
From
helping
each
other
through
crazy
workloads
to
practicing
presentations
in
the
middle
of
airports
,
we
viewed
each
other
not
as
competition
,
but
as
collaborators
,
and
ultimately
,
friends
.
Though
engineering
is
often
perceived
on
campus
as
rigid
,
we
refused
to
subscribe
to
this
notion
.
When
faced
with
challenges
,
we
drew
upon
other
life
experiences
to
assemble
an
eclectic
array
of
materials
.
When
we
couldn’t
find
neoprene
fabric
at
the
local
store
,
we
ordered
dozens
of
kiddie
lunch
boxes
from
Amazon
.
And
,
best
of
all
,
when
we
needed
to
find
a
cheap
,
water
based
gel
to
model
intestines
,
two
gallons
of
lubricant
saved
the
day
.
Yes
,
you
read
that
right
lube
.
Just
imagine
when
we
submitted
that
item
for
reimbursement
.
.
.
In
doing
all
of
this
,
we
learned
that
design
thinking
doesn’t
have
to
be
formal
and
purely
academic
;
all
it
takes
is
a
good
sense
of
humor
and
a
spark
or
two
of
creativity
.

Coming
into
the
project
,
we
were
clearly
not
experts
on
what
postpartum
organs
felt
like
.
We
fervently
began
researching
and
designing
,
creating
over
fifty
uterus
and
many
body
prototypes
before
coming
to
our
final
iteration
.
We
tried
everything
rigid
,
sticky
,
solid
,
hollow
,
big
,
small
.
At
one
point
,
we
sent
a
3D
life
sized
uterus
model
to
the
printer
.
When
we
received
the
email
notification
that
our
print
was
ready
,
two
minutes
later
,
we
retrieved
a
miniature
uterus
from
the
tray
.
Our
scaling
had
been
wrong
,
and
we
immediately
burst
out
laughing
.
Another
time
,
we
wheeled
our
model
on
a
cart
through
Duke
Hospital
to
present
it
to
a
gynecologist
.
As
the
physician
gave
us
feedback
,
the
model’s
ballistics
gels
began
to
melt
.
First
,
slowly
,
and
then
all
at
once
.
The
setbacks
we
encountered
in
both
of
these
instances
were
frustrating
,
yet
we
learned
to
accept
our
mistakes
and
to
use
them
to
better
determine
how
we
could
improve
our
design
.
After
further
tinkering
with
the
3D
printers
and
evaluating
new
molding
materials
that
wouldn’t
melt
at
room
temperature
,
we
emerged
with
a
more
viable
product
to
present
to
our
clients
.
And
then
the
iterative
process
,
where
failures
inform
design
,
began
again
.
Upon
finishing
a
prototype
,
one
of
our
teammates
shouted
across
a
lecture
hall
,
Guys
!
I
finished
the
uterus
!
Immediately
,
all
heads
turned
.
Though
vaginas
and
uteri
had
grown
to
be
everyday
staples
of
our
vocabulary
,
many
of
our
fellow
classmates
were
surprised
,
and
sometimes
uncomfortable
,
listening
to
us
talk
about
our
project
.
Working
in
the
women’s
health
space
showed
us
how
deeply
entrenched
stigmas
related
to
female
anatomy
and
reproduction
are
in
our
society
,
and
we
quickly
grew
to
realize
that
we
played
a
role
in
uprooting
certain
taboos
.
Half
of
the
fun
was
standing
alongside
our
unconventional
project
in
order
to
raise
awareness
about
maternal
mortality
.
Years
from
now
,
when
we
look
back
on
our
first
year
,
alongside
all
of
the
traditional
Duke
fun
,
we
will
remember
our
daily
trips
to
the
POD
,
the
intense
conversations
with
our
team
,
and
the
jam
packed
race
to
finish
our
project
.
In
the
most
unexpected
of
ways
,
engineering
taught
us
never
to
underestimate
our
abilities
.
The
status
quo
is
ova
rated
,
anyways
.

fall
plant
sale
this
Saturday
will
help
sponsor
student
summer
internships
in
horticulture
.
Walking
is
one
thing
I
love
most
about
being
at
Duke
down
long
stretches
of
Campus
Drive
,
under
stone
arches
on
West
Campus
,
up
and
down
the
hills
of
the
Al
Buehler
trail
but
mostly
,
through
the
gardens
.
While
wandering
through
their
maze
,
Duke
felt
the
most
right
it
ever
has
,
as
if
the
winding
paths
were
leading
me
to
exactly
where
I
was
supposed
to
be
at
exactly
the
right
time
.
Maybe
it’s
because
when
I
am
walking
,
I
feel
more
like
myself
than
under
any
other
circumstance
.
Walking
feels
like
a
devotion
,
a
prayer
with
my
feet
.
Today
,
though
,
I
deviated
from
my
usual
routine
I
went
on
a
run
.
I
laced
up
my
shoes
and
turned
up
my
music
and
kicked
up
a
path
of
dust
behind
me
.
I’m
not
graceful
,
and
I’m
not
fast
,
but
I
keep
going
anyways
,
the
cracks
on
the
sidewalk
giving
rhythm
to
my
strides
.
It’s
easier
to
move
fast
through
the
world
without
stopping
and
staring
.
It’s
also
easier
to
move
through
the
world
by
running
away
from
difficult
people
and
difficult
situations
.
I
can
usually
run
far
enough
that
there
is
distance
between
me
and
a
problem
,
a
way
that
I
can
leave
behind
my
thoughts
and
frustrations
and
anxieties
and
focus
only
on
the
pavement
and
breathing
in
and
out
.
In
and
out
.
But
in
reality
,
running
only
works
for
a
while
.
Legs
tire
,
muscles
ache
.
And
what
then
?
I
walk
.
Deliberate
and
slow
.
Observant
and
careful
.
The
sidewalk
no
longer
keeps
time
to
my
steps
;
instead
I
meander
in
circling
patterns
that
seem
to
have
no
clear
direction
.
The
music
no
longer
drowns
out
the
world
around
me
;
instead
I
listen
to
the
whispered
hum
of
cars
passing
by
and
the
sound
of
birds
calling
.
I
walk
so
I
can
slow
down
the
speed
of
the
world
and
take
it
all
in
,
at
my
own
pace
.
My
thoughts
wandered
back
to
walking
this
week
,
but
walking
of
a
different
kind
.
In
training
to
become
an
orientation
counselor
,
my
FAC
group
did
an
activity
called
a
privilege
walk
,
in
which
steps
are
taken
forward
and
backward
to
demonstrate
the
advantages
that
a
few
have
over
many
.
Things
like
having
two
parents
at
home
,
a
pantry
full
of
food
,
and
a
house
with
books
on
the
shelves
.

To
talk
about
privilege
among
a
group
of
so
many
varied
backgrounds
brings
an
inherent
discomfort
.
In
most
settings
,
we
resort
to
metaphors
to
make
it
easier
a
relay
race
with
different
starting
lines
,
or
a
playing
field
in
need
of
leveling
.
But
maybe
walking
is
the
most
relevant
,
especially
here
at
Duke
.
The
activity
is
meant
to
be
a
visual
representation
of
our
positions
in
life
,
and
a
way
to
examine
the
societal
structures
that
placed
us
there
.
But
in
our
discussion
of
these
issues
,
we
didn’t
touch
on
it’s
called
a
walk
in
the
first
place
.
One
step
forward
,
or
one
step
back
.
These
illuminate
the
privileges
each
of
us
carry
,
or
lack
,
in
a
way
that
can
be
measured
in
tangible
distances
instead
of
abstract
identity
markers
.
Maybe
it’s
uncomfortable
to
frame
privilege
as
a
walk
because
it
means
that
we
can’t
run
away
from
it
.
I’ve
had
to
slowly
and
deliberately
come
to
terms
with
this
the
longer
I’ve
been
at
Duke
the
fact
that
my
privilege
informs
nearly
everything
I
do
here
,
and
nearly
every
decision
that
brought
me
here
.
I
can
try
to
outrun
it
,
but
catches
up
anyways
.
Walking
and
with
it
,
looking
and
thinking
and
listening
will
be
what
leads
to
understanding
where
I
might
go
from
here
upon
graduation
.
To
walk
is
to
notice
all
of
the
things
around
you
at
a
heightened
sense
.
To
walk
is
realize
how
two
feet
carry
the
weight
of
your
body
.
To
walk
is
to
realize
that
you
don’t
do
it
alone
.
I
think
back
on
the
last
four
years
,
on
what
I've
really
,
truly
needed
.
It
wasn’t
the
prestige
that
comes
from
a
Duke
degree
,
or
front
row
spot
in
Cameron
Indoor
.
It
wasn’t
a
shiny
resume
or
an
A
in
Orgo
II
.
What
I
needed
was
a
pair
of
comfortable
shoes
and
people
who
will
walk
beside
me
on
the
journey
.
As
current
students
begin
rallying
for
LDOC
and
staking
out
the
perfect
study
spot
in
Perkins
for
finals
season
,
starry
eyed
Blue
Devil
Days
attendees
are
flooding
campus
once
again
.
While
some
prospective
students
are
primarily
evaluating
the
university
based
on
the
rigor
of
classes
,
the
quality
of
the
food
in
the
Brodhead
Center
and
general
campus
atmosphere
,
others
are
facing
a
far
more
daunting
,
deterministic
metric
financial
aid
.
For
p
frosh
seeking
need
based
financial
aid
,
the
festivities
of
Blue
Devil
Days
are
partially
clouded
by
anxious
visits
to
the
Karsh
Office
of
Undergraduate
Financial
Support
.
Middle
and
working
class
prospective
students
are
faced
with
the
stressful
task
of
weighing
the
promised
benefits
of
Duke's
prestige
against
the
astronomical
cost
of
attending
such
an
expensive
university
.
Many
are
likely
wondering
how
they
could
possibly
afford
four
years
of
attendance
,
how
many
summer
jobs
and
work
study
positions
they
would
have
to
take
on
,
and
if
it’s
fair
to
ask
their
family
to
make
sacrifices
for
a
nearly
75
,
000
price
tag
.
A
weekend
that
should
be
about
celebrating
their
years
of
academic
excellence
leaves
many
students
feeling
lost
and
worried
if
all
their
efforts
could
be
rendered
null
and
void
by
annually
rising
tuition
.
However
,
in
contrast
,
other
prospective
first
years
who
have
been
awarded
merit
scholarships
or
athletic
scholarships
are
able
to
freely
enjoy
the
weekend’s
festivities
with
less
anxiety
.
Duke
is
unique
amongst
its
peers
as
the
only
institution
in
the
top
ten
highest
ranking
universities
that
offers
full
ride
merit
scholarships
.
Duke
gives
out
a
number
of
prominent
full
ride
merit
scholarships
,
including
the
Benjamin
N
.
Duke
B
.
N
.
Scholars
,
Angier
B
.
Duke
A
.
B
.
Scholars
,
David
M
.
Rubenstein
Scholars
,
Reginaldo
Howard
Memorial
Scholars
,
Robertson
Scholars
,
Trinity
Scholars
,
University
Scholars
,
North
Carolina
Math
Scholars
and
Karsh
International
Scholars
.
These
scholarships
give
full
monetary
assistance
to
the
recipient
,
typically
in
addition
to
programmatic
resources
and
professional
assistance
.
They
also
give
Duke
a
competitive
edge
when
convincing
exceptional
students
with
many
attractive
options
on
their
table
to
choose
Duke
over
the
other
comparable
,
more
established
Ivy
League
institutions
.
However
,
a
concerning
facet
of
some
of
these
well
known
programs
like
the
A
.
B
.
Scholarship
,
B
.
N
.
Scholarship
and
the
Robertson
scholarship
is
that
they
don't
necessarily
account
for
need
.
While
merit
can
be
measured
by
a
number
of
qualities
or
actions
,
the
measurement
of
individual
merit
is
complicated
by
overarching
unequal
socioeconomic
structures
and
disparate
resource
access
.
Depending
on
immutable
factors
like
generational
wealth
,
school
district
funding
and
family
obligations
,
students
end
up
having
widely
differing
levels
of
access
to
the
tools
and
resources
which
allow
them
to
demonstrate
or
hone
their
abilities
.
As
a
result
,
a
standardized
benchmark
for
delineating
academic
or
personal
excellence
doesn't
accurately
gauge
applicants
,
erasing
the
differences
in
hurdles
or
personal
challenges
.
As
it
stands
,
merit
based
awards
can
in
part
be
the
result
of
having
funds
to
pay
for
college
admissions
advisors
who
review
your
essays
to
make
sure
they
are
perfectly
crafted
,
or
having
a
pricey
tutor
who
will
prepare
you
for
ACT
,
SAT
and
AP
tests
.
Additionally
,
all
those
impressive
extra
curriculars
,
sports
programs
and
eye
opening
travel
experiences
that
characterize
the
applications
of
merit
award
winners
certainly
don't
come
cheap
.
Students
who
cannot
afford
such
luxuries
and
still
successfully
fought
to
get
their
acceptance
letters
are
left
questioning
if
their
efforts
were
worth
the
struggle
.
How
can
students
who
attended
schools
without
well
funded
debate
programs
,
who
didn't
have
parents
capable
of
bankrolling
a
nonprofit
venture
or
who
had
to
work
to
afford
standardized
test
fees
possibly
compete
if
there's
no
variable
for
difference
in
resources
?
While
some
students
are
unable
to
financially
guarantee
their
academic
future
,
their
financially
secure
and
talented
peers
can
enjoy
the
possibility
of
receiving
supplemental
but
not
as
critical
financial
support
with
their
merit
scholarships
.
The
parameters
for
merit
here
are
subjective
,
contextless
and
uncritical
,
calling
the
entire
concept
of
meritocracy
into
question
.
Furthermore
,
conversations
around
socioeconomic
inequity
would
be
myopic
if
discussions
about
racial
inequity
were
absent
.
The
selection
process
of
the
merit
scholars
perpetuates
academia’s
chronic
underrepresentation
of
students
of
color
,
particularly
Black
students
.
This
is
painfully
prominent
in
the
A
.
B
.
Scholars
program
,
where
there
is
clearly
a
dearth
of
Black
African
American
students
in
the
Classes
of
2019
2022
.
The
program
describes
the
scholars
as
students
who
are
,
by
any
measure
,
among
the
best
in
the
nation
and
the
world
.
The
absence
of
Black
students
in
the
program
potentially
upholds
a
narrative
in
which
Black
students
could
not
be
among
the
best
nationally
and
internationally
and
can
only
exist
as
exceptional
and
meritable
through
the
channel
of
a
racially
specific
program
,
like
the
Reginaldo
Howard
Scholars
Program
.
Broadly
speaking
,
while
the
distribution
of
scholarships
certainly
should
not
be
modeled
after
a
quota
system
at
the
risk
of
tokenizing
marginalized
students
,
the
screening
process
for
merit
scholarships
should
try
to
target
root
causes
of
socioeconomic
inequity
by
partially
making
need
based
considerations
.
Other
comparable
elite
universities
which
Duke
routinely
tries
to
emulate
in
nearly
every
other
way
strictly
give
out
need
based
financial
aid
.
One
could
argue
that
the
creation
of
merit
scholarships
by
specific
donors
makes
them
a
permanent
part
of
Duke
financial
aid
.
However
,
the
university
thinks
they
are
properly
treating
the
chronic
issue
of
socioeconomic
inequity
in
higher
education
through
purely
merit
based
scholarships
,
then
it
is
a
counterproductive
treatment
.
Merit
scholarships
decoupled
from
need
based
considerations
exacerbate
the
existing
condition
.
Consequently
,
Duke
ought
to
make
all
scholarships
have
a
need
based
component
.
Beyond
a
short
term
restructuring
,
a
more
genuine
and
holistic
long
term
vision
would
include
divesting
from
the
idea
that
selective
financial
empowerment
is
empowerment
for
all
,
making
material
and
programmatic
infrastructure
accessible
outside
of
the
merit
scholarship
framework
,
and
denouncing
meritocracy
as
a
myth
.
The
Chronicle
regrets
the
error
.
That’s
what
we
write
when
we
issue
a
correction
.
Why
?
Once
the
article
is
updated
,
why
even
note
that
it
was
corrected
?
Who
cares
about
The
Chronicle’s
regret
?
Well
,
for
one
,
it’s
transparent
.
It
lets
the
readers
know
that
prior
information
in
the
article
was
false
.
It
also
expresses
wrongdoing
and
it
accepts
responsibility
for
that
wrongdoing
.
You've
probably
seen
that
correction
in
the
pages
of
The
Chronicle
often
enough
that
it's
lost
its
meaning
.
But
,
to
me
,
these
words
are
some
of
the
most
meaningful
words
we
print
.
Former
Chronicle
columnist
Matthew
King
put
it
best
when
he
wrote
that
we
were
living
in
a
remorseless
age
.
At
a
national
or
global
level
,
the
zeitgeist
is
to
avoid
showing
weakness
.
But
,
are
Americans
,
as
individuals
,
actually
remorseless
?
Of
course
not
.
We
feel
guilt
and
shame
all
the
time
.
But
I
think
sometimes
we
don’t
allow
ourselves
to
feel
it
enough
.
For
the
past
four
years
,
I’ve
seen
and
reported
on
the
goings
on
at
the
University
.
It’s
been
the
greatest
experience
of
my
life
.
I’ve
gotten
to
write
about
people
who
are
passionate
about
their
school
and
their
community
,
accomplished
amazing
feats
and
inspired
us
to
work
harder
.
But
,
I’ve
also
gotten
to
see
us
be
complacent
.
I’ve
seen
us
criticize
Greek
life
at
Duke
all
day
long
and
at
the
end
of
that
day
,
go
home
to
our
Greek
section
.
Or
say
we
don’t
believe
in
hyperexclusivity
,
yet
participate
complicity
in
organizations
that
promote
a
hyperexclusive
culture
.
Or
probably
the
most
frequent
,
say
we
don’t
believe
in
sexism
or
racism
but
stand
silently
by
as
we
watch
other
students
or
workers
be
degraded
by
those
systems
.
I’ve
always
thought
that
the
worst
thing
in
this
life
is
to
be
apathetic
.
Since
coming
to
Duke
,
I’ve
realized
that
the
second
worst
thing
is
to
be
complacent
.
Being
apathetic
is
not
having
values
.
Being
complacent
is
not
acting
in
accordance
with
your
values
.
And
in
so
many
ways
,
when
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
complacent
,
we
become
complicit
in
structures
that
hurt
others
.
If
The
Chronicle
has
taught
me
anything
,
it’s
to
constantly
ask
myself
,
how
am
I
complicit
in
things
I
inherently
don’t
believe
in
?
’
I
will
be
the
first
person
to
admit
that
I
am
complicit
in
global
human
trafficking
or
climate
change
because
of
the
products
I
use
.
Or
that
I
am
complicit
in
the
perpetuation
of
oppressive
racist
systems
in
our
society
.
Or
in
participating
in
that
millennial
trope
of
neglecting
my
family
.
Or
in
propagating
a
culture
obsessed
with
celebrity
yes
,
I
watch
The
Daily
Mail
on
Snapchat
almost
every
day
.
I
can
admit
these
things
not
because
I
am
shameless
.
It’s
quite
the
opposite
.

The
fifth
iteration
of
Greek
Ally
Week
took
place
on
Duke’s
campus
last
week
.
The
annual
programming
which
includes
panels
,
ally
training
sessions
and
HIV
testing
dates
back
to
the
efforts
of
numerous
factions
within
the
Panhellenic
Association
and
the
Interfraternity
Council
in
2014
.
Although
the
events
were
founded
to
promote
healthy
dialogue
around
allyship
and
the
experiences
of
LGBTQ
folk
in
Greek
organizations
,
Greek
Ally
Week
hasn’t
been
without
understandable
controversy
.
Recent
critique
has
even
come
from
those
who
have
participated
in
the
program
itself
.
Although
proponents
of
the
events
defend
Greek
Ally
Week
as
steps
toward
changing
the
system
of
sororities
and
fraternities
from
the
inside
,
the
programming
has
yet
to
make
substantial
,
visible
inroads
in
repairing
the
serious
conflicts
between
Greek
life
and
values
of
inclusion
.
In
practice
,
Greek
Ally
Week
serves
more
as
a
ritual
penance
that
attempts
to
absolve
Greek
organizations
from
taking
responsibility
for
the
gender
and
sexuality
stereotypes
they
perpetuate
every
other
week
of
the
year
.
From
sorority
pressure
to
maintain
a
feminine
appearance
and
heteronormative
date
functions
to
the
inherent
reproduction
of
the
gender
binary
through
the
fraternity
sorority
divide
,
most
of
Greek
life
rejects
the
virtues
they
broadcast
once
per
year
.
A
central
conundrum
of
Greek
Ally
Week
,
however
,
isn’t
how
a
social
organization
based
in
gender
division
could
aid
the
struggle
to
fight
transphobia
and
homophobia
.
It’s
in
the
question
'who
is
Greek
Ally
Week
for
?
'
This
year
,
the
bulk
of
the
week’s
events
were

and
201
levels
available
as
well
as
a
student
panel
.
Although
the
panel
is
open
to
everyone
,
the
trainings
and
discussion
groups
are
explicitly
aimed
at
Greek
life
members
.
With
many
of
these
events
not
advertised
toward
to
the
general
public
,
it’s
unclear
if
they
are
meant
to
serve
LGBTQIA
fraternity
and
sorority
members
an
affiliation
that
already
lends
itself
to
a
outsized
proportion
of
white
and
wealthy
queer
people
represented
or
to
help
cis
,
straight
members
to
feel
woke
for
having
attended
Ally
101
.
What
it
means
to
be
an
ally
to
an
oppressed
or
marginalized
group
has
become
diluted
and
obfuscated
due
to
incorrect
overuse
.
As
a
result
,
the
title
no
longer
means
anything
beyond
the
empty
claiming
of
an
identity
as
ally
to
X
group
.
What
changes
have
come
about
from
five
years
of
Greek
Ally
Week
programming
,
and
do
they
stretch
beyond
queer
peers
who
share
their
social
circle
,
class
wealth
and
favorite
ski
resort
?
How
about
those
who
are
queer
and
non
affiliated
?
This
is
not
to
exclude
other
selective
social
groups
on
campus
from
this
critique
.
SLGs
don’t
even
go
so
far
as
to
hold
the
pretense
of
a
week
tackling
the
homophobia
and
transphobia
that
exists
within
their
ranks
.
One
week
of
the
year
dedicated
to
providing
a
crash
course
to
those
within
Greek
organizations
who
choose
to
attend
doesn’t
exonerate
the
patriarchal
system
foundational
to
Greek
life
.
Whether
you
believe
the
system
can
be
fixed
from
the
inside
or
not
,
it
is
clear
there
are
significant
flaws
with
both
Greek
Life
and
attempts
to
reform
it
.
Ultimately
,
Greek
Ally
Week
and
its
shortcomings
pose
an
existential
question
to
IFC
and
PanHel
as
to
what
it
stands
for
in
the
light
of
the
regressive
nbsp
;
gender
and
sexuality
norms
it
perpetuates
.
In
that
best
Duke
spirit
of
complaining
about
what
goes
on
here
and
doing
nothing
to
fix
it
I
graduate
in
just
over
three
weeks
here
are
a
few
of
my
least
favorite
things
.
In
my
time
here
,
I
have
been
unendingly
baffled
at
the
mania
for
service
work
and
volunteerism
that
achieves
little
more
than
making
the
volunteer
feel
good
about
themselves
.
Perhaps
I
misremember
,
but
as
I
recall
Mother
Teresa
made
a
bit
more
of
a
commitment
.
And
the
way
too
many
of
us
use
this
service
,
to
be
well
rounded
in
the
next
round
of
applications
,
is
appalling
.
What
is
the
intention
?
To
see
what
happens
when
systems
which
create
inequality
are
in
full
operation
,
so
that
we
have
a
better
chance
of
getting
a
corner
office
in
those
same
systems
?
If
you
like
consulting
,
consult
with
your
better
angels
whether
your
fair
weather
activism
achieves
lasting
and
sustainable
good
.
A
clue
it
does
not
.
In
my
time
here
,
I
have
never
understood
why
our
first
impulse
is
to
division
rather
than
reconciliation
.
At
almost
every
opportunity
we
burn
bridges
where
we
could
build
them
.
Take
a
paradigm
of
the
Duke
Protest
trademark
pending
a
recent
article
marveled
how
the
unelected
People’s
State
of
the
University
has
been
meeting
with
the
administration
.
Did
it
occur
to
anyone
who
stormed
a
stage
that
they
might
have
gotten
farther
,
faster
,
by
asking
for
a
meeting
?
By
asking
for
dialogue
?
Our
student
community
used
written
advocacy
and
requested
meetings
and
reversed
work
reassignments
for
housekeepers
.
Our
student
community
used
written
advocacy
and
requested
meetings
and
convinced
the
administration
to
partially
reverse
its
decision
to
remove
healthcare
from
certain
student
financial
aid
.
From
the
news
breaking
to
the
resolution
being
reached
,
hardly
a
month
went
by
.
No
wonder
,
that
snapping
the
olive
branch
sooner
than
offering
it
has
held
them
back
so
long
?
Throwing
yourself
onto
a
sword
does
not
make
you
a
martyr
.
If
no
one
asks
what
you
have
to
say
,
perhaps
you
have
yelled
so
loud
and
long
that
you
never
gave
them
the
chance
to
engage
you
.
In
my
time
here
,
the
social
scene
has
been
an
unending
and
grotesque
ballet
of
self
debasement
.
What
do
we
free
thinkers
do
the
minute
we
join
campus
?
Find
a
ready
made
group
of
friends
and
remake
ourselves
in
their
image
,
of
course
!
Do
you
find
that
your
work
hard
play
hard
lifestyle
,
doing
what
other
people
tell
you
to
do
to
fit
in
,
is
taking
a
toll
?
Why
then
,
pre
med
,
play
the
physician
you
hope
to
be
and
heal
thyself
!
If
your
choices
unerringly
cause
you
distress
,
make
different
choices
.
If
you
allow
yourself
to
be
shaped
by
every
passing
tide
,
do
not
be
confident
that
anything
you
call
yourself
will
survive
in
the
comprehensive
ocean
of
life
outside
of
Duke
.
In
my
time
here
,
I
have
seen
people
of
promise
do
what
I
hold
ill
guided
at
best
and
stupid
at
worst
.
In
my
time
here
,
I
have
not
once
doubted
that
these
people
do
what
they
do
because
they
care
,
and
deeply
.
Do
people
act
on
this
campus
in
manners
with
which
I
do
not
agree
,
not
to
the
worth
of
a
cause
but
to
the
manner
of
its
carriage
?
Yes
.
Do
people
on
this
campus
seek
community
in
ways
that
can
most
gently
be
described
as
toxic
?
Yes
.
Do
people
try
the
same
counterproductive
models
and
the
same
backward
plans
and
pine
for
different
results
?
Yes
.
But
they
do
this
my
peers
do
this
because
they
want
to
at
least
help
someone
and
they
want
to
change
things
and
they
want
to
build
community
,
somehow
.
Your
methods
baffle
me
.
Your
sincerity
heartens
me
.
When
I
ask
'does
the
academy
matter
?
'
I
suppose
I
wonder
how
four
years’
retreat
into
this
stone
ring
in
the
middle
of
a
forest
prepares
any
of
us
for
the
real
world
,
or
whatever
corner
of
it
we
ourselves
will
enter
.
And
I
think
,
four
years
on
and
in
this
chapter’s
waning
light
,
I
have
found
my
answer
.
The
academy
makes
us
care
.
We
come
to
a
place
like
Duke
,
and
we
find
in
our
friends
or
our
groups
or
causes
or
classes
or
any
number
of
things
some
gap
in
the
world
that
seems
just
our
size
and
shape
.
We
chase
the
chance
to
supply
this
lack
,
often
imperfectly
,
often
unevenly
,
often
obliquely
,
yet
ever
sincerely
.

To
the
Editor
Your
editorial
regarding
merit
based
scholarships
at
Duke
lacks
much
contact
with
the
reality
of
these
programs
.
Directors
of
these
programs
over
the
last
18
years
of
which
we
were
two
can
confirm
that
that
the
parameters
for
merit
are
far
from
subjective
,
contextless
and
uncritical
and
that
discussions
of
racial
inequity
are
ever
present
in
the
selection
process
.
nbsp
;
A
glance
at
the
demography
of
successful
candidates
for
the
merit
scholarship
programs
at
Duke
makes
it
manifest
that
these
programs
do
not
perpetuate
academia’s
chronic
underrepresentation
of
students
of
color
,
particularly
black
students
.
The
real
facts
about
the
selection
and
recruitment
process
are
quite
to
contrary
of
that
suggested
by
your
convoluted
prose
The
absence
of
Black
students
in
the
A
.
B
.
Duke
program
potentially
upholds
a
narrative
in
which
black
students
could
not
be
among
the
best
nationally
and
internationally
and
can
only
exist
as
exceptional
and
meritable
through
the
channel
of
racially
specific
programs
like
the
Reginaldo
Howard
Scholars
Program
.
You
may
wish
to
speak
to
members
of
the
student
recruitment
committees
and
25
years
of
faculty
directors
of
the
merit
scholarship
programs
to
confirm
these
matters
.
Despite
your
claim
,
the
screening
process
for
merit
scholarships
has
always
been
aimed
to
target
the
root
causes
of
socioeconomic
inequality
.
Weighting
for
inequality
of
opportunity
has
long
been
the
most
critical
variable
in
assessing
degrees
of
achievement
.
The
real
problem
facing
Duke
and
the
merit
scholarships
is
that
the
universities
with
which
these
programs
compete
for
students
Harvard
,
Princeton
,
Stanford
all
offer
every
high
achieving
student
with
need
the
same
financial
package
the
Duke
merit
scholarships
provide
.
Money
alone
no
longer
brings
any
of
the
academically
most
meritorious
students
to
Duke
.
The
greater
cachet
of
these
other
institutions
matters
,
especially
to
first
generation
university
students
.
It
is
only
the
programmatic
enrichment
of
the
merit
scholarship
delivered
by
Duke
faculty
who
have
directed
these
programs
that
successfully
recruits
students
,
whether
minority
or
not
.
If
you’ve
ever
bought
a
drink
on
campus
just
to
have
your
straw
disintegrate
halfway
through
your
meal
,
it
should
come
as
no
surprise
that
Duke
Dining
has
banned
plastic
straws
.
This
ban
is
one
of
a
number
of
steps
that
the
university
has
recently
taken
in
an
effort
to
be
a
more
environmentally
friendly
campus
.
In
fact
,
Duke
is
working
towards
being
carbon
neutral
by
2024
.
But
if
Duke
really
cares
about
sustainability
,
why
hasn’t
there
been
a
major
push
for
plant
based
options
on
campus
?
Let’s
be
real
here
incremental
changes
like
banning
plastic
straws
won’t
do
much
to
better
the
environment
,
especially
when
you
consider
that
straws
account
for
only
.
03
percent
of
the
plastic
discarded
in
the
oceans
annually
.
While
the
plastic
straw
movement
might
not
be
doing
much
,
incorporating
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
into
your
meals
could
have
the
impact
you’re
looking
for
.
A
recent
study
from
the
University
of
Oxford
found
that
eliminating
animal
products
from
your
diet
could
reduce
your
food
carbon
footprint
by
73
percent
.
Of
course
,
there
are
other
considerations
beyond
the
environment
.
Animals
undoubtedly
experience
pain
,
and
factory
farmed
animals
like
chickens
are
kept
in
horrific
conditions
characterized
by
near
constant
suffering
.
People
already
care
about
certain
animals
and
not
others
,
but
there
is
no
agreement
on
which
species
fall
on
which
side
of
the
line
.
Our
beliefs
about
which
animals
have
a
right
not
to
be
eaten
or
mistreated
is
largely
dependent
on
the
cultures
we
are
born
into
.
The
arbitrary
distinctions
are
easily
shaken
with
a
bit
of
honest
introspection
what
makes
a
puppy
different
enough
from
a
chicken
that
we
would
cuddle
one
and
eat
the
other
?
One
might
claim
that
moral
duties
only
extend
to
fellow
members
of
humanity
.
But
it
would
be
difficult
to
argue
that
a
non
human
,
sentient
,
and
intelligent
species
coming
to
Earth
to
devour
humans
would
be
a
morally
neutral
event
,
so
perhaps
we
shouldn’t
accept
each
species
only
valuing
the
lives
of
its
own
members
.
If
we
can’t
be
firm
in
our
beliefs
about
the
morality
of
animal
farming
,
can
we
incentivize
the
industry
to
kill
of
farm
animals
each
year
and
still
think
of
ourselves
as
moral
people
?
Consider
another
factor
animal
farming
has
immense
externalities
on
humans
.
Jobs
in
slaughterhouses
are
dangerous
and
come
with
immense
health
risks
.
Factory
farmed
animals
are
fed
antibiotics
that
are
accelerating
superbugs
.
Animal
waste
can
often
contaminate
local
water
sources
,
causing
a
host
of
environmental
and
health
problems
.
Farm
animals
undoubtedly
increase
the
risk
of
zoonotic
diseases
which
could
quickly
become
pandemics
.
To
be
clear
,
very
few
people
on
this
campus
seem
to
care
about
veganism
.
Plant
based
options
are
immensely
neglected
at
Duke
.
West
Union
does
have
a
vegan
eatery
Sprout
,
but
very
few
other
places
on
campus
make
an
effort
to
offer
vegan
and
vegetarian
options
.
A
quick
skim
of
the
Fix
My
Campus
Facebook
page
will
reveal
more
than
a
few
students
complaining
about
the
lack
of
fresh
vegetables
or
soy
milk
at
the
Duke
Store
and
Uncle
Harry’s
.
So
what
should
Duke
do
to
address
this
issue
?
The
university
needs
to
do
nbsp
;
more
to
support
and
promote
plant
based
eating
on
this
campus
.
There
needs
to
be
more
vegan
options
and
these
options
should
be
well
publicized
.
At
a
,
Duke
should
not
regress
.
I
was
really
saddened
to
see
that
Pitchforks
took
the
Garden
of
Edens
salad
off
of
its
menu
this
year
;
as
one
of
the
few
vegan
options
at
Pitchforks
in
previous
years
,
I
can’t
imagine
why
someone
would
decide
to
remove
it
from
the
menu
.
Duke’s
eateries
should
also
add
new
vegetarian
and
vegan
menu
items
!
It
would
be
quite
easy
for
Duke
Dining
to
vegan
ize
existing
menu
items
.
For
example
,
Sprout’s
kale
salad
used
to
have
cheese
in
it
,
but
the
cheese
was
removed
at
DUSDAC’s
suggestion
.
Menu
items
do
not
need
to
be
fully
vegan
however
,
they
should
be
vegan
by
default
and
we
could
perhaps
allow
students
the
option
to
add
animal
products
if
they
desire
.
Having
these
vegan
options
as
a
default
would
gently
nudge
students
towards
making
the
more
conscientious
decision
without
forcing
students
to
give
up
animal
products
if
they
do
not
want
to
.
In
particular
,
Duke
should
ensure
that
the
vegan
options
available
are
nutritious
and
varied
.
While
plant
based
diets
often
are
very
healthy
in
fact
,
probably
healthier
than
a
lot
of
meat
focused
diets
I
often
hear
people
bring
up
the
concern
that
if
they
were
to
go
vegan
,
they
wouldn’t
get
enough
protein
in
their
diets
.
While
this
concern
is
overblown
,
Duke
can
and
should
do
more
to
expand
the
vegan
protein
offerings
Sazon
calling
portobello
a
protein
isn’t
going
far
enough

Looking
beyond
Duke
Dining
,
individual
students
can
also
take
action
.
Obviously
,
not
every
Duke
student
will
become
vegan
.
While
I
would
love
to
see
more
students
eating
vegan
on
this
campus
,
I
know
it’s
unrealistic
to
think
the
whole
of
the
student
body
would
give
up
meat
overnight
.
However
,
you
don’t
need
to
be
fully
vegan
or
vegetarian
to
incorporate
plant
based
options
into
your
diet
!
For
example
,
at
Red
Mango
,
the
whey
protein
and
vegan
protein
cost
the
same
.
I
suggested
a
friend
try
the
vegan
protein
one
day
,
and
because
she
liked
it
just
as
much
,
nbsp
;
she
now
orders
the
vegan
protein
at
Red
Mango
;
even
though
she
is
far
from
fully
vegan
,
she
is
making
a
point
to
make
some
easy
plant
based
swaps
where
it’s
easy
for
her
to
do
so
.
These
types
of
swaps
are
steps
that
everyone
on
this
campus
could
easily
take
,
no
matter
their
overall
dietary
preferences
.
Five
people
reducing
their
consumption
of
animal
products
by
20
percent
is
in
a
sense
the
same
as
one
person
going
fully
vegan
every
bit
counts
.
While
Duke
Dining
should
expand
its
plant
based
offerings
,
it’s
also
important
to
highlight
the
existing
vegan
options
that
are
already
here
.
We
should
all
be
encouraged
to
try
some
of
these
out
.
If
you’re
a
chicken
nugget
fan
,
you
should
try
the
vegan
nuggets
at
Sprout
.
If
you
like
wings
,
Heavenly
Buffaloes
has
vegan
ones
and
so
does
Dankery
on
food
points
too
!
For
my
fellow
coffee
addicts
,
try
choosing
soy
or
almond
milk
in
your
morning
latte
to
mix
things
up
.
If
you
really
just
can’t
seem
to
part
ways
with
your
cherished
whey
protein
or
your
treasured
Pitchforks
haystacks
,
consider
other
ways
you
can
support
animal
welfare
.
Donating
money
to
some
of
the
most
impactful
animal
welfare
charities
is
an
incredibly
cost
effective
way
to
better
animal
welfare
,
with
some
estimates
of
preventing
a
year
of
an
animal
suffering
in
a
factory
farm
at
just
a
couple
of
dollars
.
We
shouldn’t
just
support
any
random
animal
charity
,
though
the
focus
of
efficacy
is
of
paramount
importance
.
Determining
which
organizations
to
support
can
be
a
daunting
task
,
but
fortunately
there
is
great
research
out
there
about
which
charities
do
good
work
in
the
space
,
especially
from
meta
charities
like
Animal
Charity
Evaluators
ACE
.
ACE
does
incredible
work
to
highlight
which
charities
best
help
animals
.
One
ACE
charity
that
has
been
a
standout
for
a
number
of
years
is
The
Humane
League
,
a
highly
effective
non
profit
focused
on
grassroots
organizing
and
corporate
outreach
.
So
if
you
really
can’t
seem
to
part
ways
with
your
carnivorous
diet
,
consider
donating
to
organizations
like
The
Humane
League
as
a
way
of
offsetting
your
meat
consumption
.
I
understand
that
people
don’t
want
to
give
up
animal
products
entirely
and
that’s
understandable
.
But
don’t
let
labels
limit
you
just
because
you
may
not
be
fully
vegetarian
or
vegan
doesn’t
mean
that
you
can’t
or
shouldn’t
be
prioritizing
animal
welfare
.
Now
go
try
Sprout’s
vegan
nuggets
.
They’re
delicious
,
I
swear
.
A
week
or
two
after
Duke
won
the
men’s
basketball
national
championship
in
Indianapolis
in
April
2015
,
I
was
in
my
room
at
my
childhood
home
10
minutes
from
campus
when
I
googled
future
Final
Four
sites
.
I
still
wasn’t
100
percent
sure
where
I
wanted
to
go
to
college
when
I
saw
that
the
2019
Final
Four
would
take
place
in
Minneapolis
my
senior
year
.
I
was
well
versed
in
Duke
basketball
history
and
also
mildly
superstitious
,
knowing
that
Duke
only
ever
wins
in
a
city
that
ends
in
apolis
.
It
seemed
like
a
sign
that
the
stars
were
aligned
for
a
storybook
ending
.
I
decided
to
come
to
Duke
.
A
silly
thing
like
that
helped
me
make
the
best
choice
of
my
life
.
I
went
through
the
motions
of
a
national
college
search
,
wary
of
going
to
school
so
close
to
home
,
but
I
think
my
decision
had
actually
been
predestined
for
many
years
.
Most
10
year
olds
in
the
mid
2000s
spent
their
free
time
reading
Harry
Potter
.
I
read
The
Encyclopedia
of
Duke
Basketball
cover
to
cover
.
Name
any
book
about
the
Blue
Devils
,
and
there’s
a
good
chance
it’s
sitting
on
my
bookshelf
.
I
knew
I
would
enjoy
the
basketball
scene
at
Duke
as
a
student
,
but
I
couldn’t
have
anticipated
how
it
would
shape
my
experience
here
.
I
suspect
something
would
have
guided
me
to
The
Chronicle
eventually
,
but
I
was
lucky
to
have
an
early
catalyst
.
The
TA
in
my
freshman
seminar
Ryan
Hoerger
,
the
sports
editor
at
the
time
went
to
the
White
House
to
cover
the
2015
national
champions’
visit
a
couple
of
weeks
into
classes
my
freshman
fall
.
Needless
to
say
,
that
seemed
pretty
cool
.
That’s
all
it
took
to
dive
into
this
labor
of
love
,
letting
my
life
revolve
around
The
Chronicle
for
most
of
my
four
years
here
.
Ask
me
about
my
favorite
weeks
of
college
,
and
by
extension
,
my
life
,
and
they’re
all
Duke
sporting
events
I
covered
the
2017
ACC
tournament
,
2019
ACC
tournament
,
2017
PK80
Invitational
and
2018
Athens
Regional
in
the
NCAA
baseball
tournament
.
It
culminated
with
a
weekend
in
Washington
to
cover
the
NCAA
men’s
basketball
East
Regional
a
month
ago
.
As
I
took
my
courtside
seat
on
press
row
before
the
Blue
Devils
tipped
off
against
Michigan
State
in
the
Elite
Eight
,
I
thought
about
that
night
in
my
room
in
2015
,
before
I
had
ever
heard
the
names
Zion
Williamson
and
R
.
J
.
Barrett
.
Everything
I
had
imagined
about
2019
was
coming
true
.
Duke
appeared
to
be
the
best
team
in
the
nation
,
featuring
the
most
electric
,
charismatic
college
basketball
player
in
recent
memory
.
One
more
win
,
and
the
Blue
Devils
would
be
en
route
to
Minneapolis
.
Of
course
,
it
didn’t
happen
.
Michigan
State’s
Cassius
Winston
dribbled
out
the
final
seconds
of
a
one
point
loss
for
Duke
a
few
feet
away
from
my
seat
.
Not
all
fairy
tales
have
the
ending
you
expect
,
but
being
there
to
cover
that
game
in
person
was
a
different
kind
of
storybook
finish
.
I
didn’t
go
to
Minneapolis
like
I
thought
I
might
when
I
was
17
,
but
I
did
cover
games
for
The
Chronicle
in
New
York
,
Portland
,
Washington
,
Pittsburgh
,
Charlottesville
,
Blacksburg
,
South
Bend
,
Clemson
,
Atlanta
,
Louisville
,
Detroit
,
Winston
Salem
,
Raleigh
,
Chapel
Hill
and
Shreveport
.
I
was
a
credentialed
reporter
three
straight
years
for
the
men’s
basketball
ACC
tournament
,
the
best
sporting
event
in
the
world
for
a
fan
growing
up
in
North
Carolina
,
and
the
Blue
Devils
and
Tar
Heels
happened
to
meet
in
the
semifinals
all
three
times
.
Duke’s
win
against
North
Carolina
this
season
was
one
of
the
most
memorable
in
the
rivalry’s
history
,
and
its
run
to
the
2017
championship
with
four
wins
in
four
days
was
unparalleled
.
There’s
a
glass
half
empty
view
that
I’ll
graduate
as
part
of
only
the
fifth
class
since
1986
never
to
see
a
men’s
basketball
Final
Four
appearance
as
Duke
students
.
That’s
not
how
I’ll
look
back
on
my
four
years
.
It
ignores
all
the
special
games
,
characters
and
moments
I’ve
seen
along
the
way
.

I
never
thought
I’d
be
on
the
court
live
tweeting
Duke
cutting
down
the
nets
after
two
different
ACC
championships
.
I
never
thought
I’d
have
the
chance
to
interview
Mike
Krzyzewski
and
some
of
the
most
talented
players
in
the
country
about
my
favorite
sport
.
Sure
,
I
never
saw
a
national
championship
as
a
student
,
but
don’t
feel
sorry
for
me
.
I’ve
been
the
luckiest
college
kid
in
America
.
Reading
Wednesday's
Chronicle
,
I
saw
an
editorial
on
The
invisible
labor
of
marginalized
faculty
.
It
described
how
15
Yale
faculty
recently
left
its
program
on
Ethnicity
,
Race
,
and
Migration
over
that
University’s
alleged
neglect
;
the
program
,
created
in
1997
,
was
unsupported
,
relying
on
volunteer
work
.
It’s
shocking
that
an
institution
of
Yale’s
caliber
would
so
disrespect
the
efforts
of
minority
faculty
and
students
.
But
these
faculty
,
although
they
feel
marginalized
,
are
at
least
of
academia
will
wither
and
die
,
not
just
targeted
programs
.
Donald
Trump
nbsp
;
pictured
here
in
Raleigh
nbsp
;
was
sworn
in
as
the
45th
president
of
the
United
States
Friday
morning
.
A
recent
piece
by
The
Chronicle's
independent
editorial
board
attempts
to
navigate
the
crowded
field
of
2020
Democratic
candidates
in
a
wandering
diatribe
that
feels
more
bitter
towards
Democratic
voters
interested
in
securing
victories
than
substantive
in
insights
.
In
an
editorial
that
somehow
simultaneously
decries
the
Democratic
field’s
problems
in
forging
an
articulable
,
unified
approach
to
beating’
the
ideals
of
Trumpism
and
lack
of
unique
platforms
,
the
board
criticizes
the
growing
push
on
the
left
to
nominate
a
candidate
who
is
either
electable
enough
or
centrist
enough
to
beat
Trump
in
the
general
election
.
To
hear
them
tell
it
,
Democratic
voters
are
already
hostage
to
the
VoteBlue
mindset
,
and
eager
to
sacrifice
policy
for
bland
,
photo
shopped
celebrities
who
enjoy
smoking
weed
and
playing
punk
rock
.
Indeed
,
Democratic
voters
are
increasingly
prioritizing
electability
in
2020
candidates
,
but
seeking
candidates
that
are
marketable
to
a
broad
voter
base
absolutely
does
not
preclude
the
party
from
choosing
someone
with
robust
policy
goals
;
the
positions
espoused
by
Andrew
Yang
or
Kamala
Harris
are
each
more
comprehensive
and
complete
than
anything
pushed
by
the
Trump
campaign
in
2016
,
but
which
the
editorial
board
seems
content
to
summarize
as
cool
.
Second
,
and
perhaps
most
importantly
,
allowing
the
party
to
drift
toward
the
center
in
order
to
bring
an
end
to
the
Trump
administration
is
simply
more
productive
in
advancing
progressive
goals
than
running
yet
another
losing
campaign
based
on
policy
.
Perhaps
the
board
would
like
to
weigh
in
on
the
2016
GOP
primary
,
wherein
the
party
nominated
a
very
stable
genius
with
a
secret
plan
to
destroy
ISIS
in
30
days
who
subsequently
won
the
presidency
and
secured
a
conservative
majority
on
the
Supreme
Court
for
the
foreseeable
future
?
Now
,
the
prior
success
of
gross
provocateurs
in
the
vein
of
Trump
certainly
need
not
push
the
Democratic
party
to
settle
for
the
lowest
common
denominator
,
but
to
insinuate
that
placing
a
premium
on
electability
and
seeing
the
value
in
celebrity
isn’t
a
productive
electoral
strategy
is
plainly
ignorant
of
recent
history
and
not
a
pragmatic
approach
to
seeking
change
.
If
these
broad
and
meaningless
platitudes
are
truly
the
insights
of
the
politically
engaged
,
then
we
can
all
look
forward
to
a
weekly
scolding
from
the
board’s
ardent
politicos
.
This
past
semester
,
I
was
hanging
out
with
a
friend
who
had
a
midterm
coming
up
.
Knowing
she
had
been
studying
virtually
nonstop
for
the
past
week
,
I
half
jokingly
suggested
that
she
could
afford
to
take
it
easy
for
a
few
hours
.
I
can’t
do
that
,
she
responded
.
I’m
pre
med
,
so
my
GPA
actually
has
to
be
perfect
if
I’m
going
to
be
successful
.
I
knew
that
she
wasn’t
completely
serious
,
but
even
so
,
I
was
surprised
.
Her
concept
of
success
was
so
different
from
my
own
.
It
seemed
that
she
saw
it
as
a
final
goal
to
be
attained
,
and
that
those
mini
successes
along
the
way
a
good
grade
on
a
midterm
,
a
perfect
GPA
did
not
naturally
mean
that
she
was
a
successful
person
.
In
other
words
,
a
successful
person
is
one
who
has
reached
their
ultimate
goal
.
In
my
eyes
,
she
was
already
extremely
successful
.
She
was
doing
very
well
at
Duke
,
an
elite
university
with
a
low
acceptance
rate
.
So
what
do
we
as
a
broader
culture
value
as
successful
?
Successful
people
do
well
in
their
classes
,
have
better
internships
or
have
jobs
lined
up
after
graduation
.
They
are
presidents
of
clubs
or
presidents
of
companies
.
They
are
successful
academically
and
professionally
.
These
are
the
standards
outside
of
Duke
too
better
colleges
or
better
jobs
are
reflective
of
success
.
Valuing
academic
and
professional
success
is
by
no
means
a
bad
thing
.
However
,
if
we
only
value
academic
and
professional
intelligence
,
then
what
are
we
excluding
from
our
views
of
success
?
Some
glaring
examples
include
social
,
creative
and
emotional
intelligence
.
However
much
you
want
to
value
these
things
,
you
somehow
always
ends
up
sacrificing
a
hangout
with
friends
for
an
extra
hour
of
studying
,
taking
that
useful
stats
class
over
the
art
class
you
wanted
to
take
or
not
having
the
time
to
talk
with
your
friend
who’s
feeling
down
because
you
just
have
to
finish
this
assignment
.
We
can
also
see
this
in
the
way
that
different
majors
are
valued
humanities
classes
are
generally
seen
as
easier
and
constantly
accompanied
with
questions
like
,
So
what
job
do
you
plan
to
get
with
that
?
In
William
Deresiewicz’s
article
The
Disadvantages
of
an
Elite
Education
,
he
notes
that
elite
universities
,
no
matter
how
much
they
advertise
their
well
rounded
liberal
arts
education
,
ultimately
focus
on
developing
and
reproducing
one
form
the
analytic
.
Duke
is
no
exception
.
Developing
a
moral
identity
,
mental
health
or
creative
ability
to
name
a
few
things
always
takes
a
backseat
to
the
storm
of
pre
professionalism
.
These
skills
are
not
prioritized
by
the
University
nor
most
of
its
students
.
The
focus
on
academic
and
professional
success
is
not
without
reason
.
Good
academics
presumably
lead
to
better
grad
schools
,
better
jobs
,
more
money
and
thus
financial
stability
.
The
lure
of
financial
stability
in
the
economy
that
we
live
in
is
an
easy
way
to
explain
why
we
might
focus
more
on
these
measures
.
However
,
assuming
that
only
better
academic
or
even
better
professional
success
will
lead
to
that
end
goal
can
be
short
sighted
.
The
workplace
doesn’t
just
want
someone
with
a
sparkling
resume
.
Even
to
achieve
professional
success
,
we
need
other
skills
.
Ask
any
recruiter
and
they’ll
tell
you
that
they’re
not
just
looking
for
someone
who
has
a
relevant
ex
job
title
.
Anyone
can
learn
on
the
job
with
a
pretty
basic
knowledge
of
the
material
.
Recruiters
also
want
someone
who
has
the
creative
intelligence
to
come
up
with
better
solutions
,
has
the
social
intelligence
to
work
with
other
people
or
the
emotional
intelligence
to
empathize
and
lead
others
.
They
want
someone
who
they’d
like
to
work
with
.
They
want
someone
human
.
Perhaps
the
reason
why
we
prioritize
analytic
intelligence
is
the
fact
that
the
measures
are
so
quantifiable
.
In
a
math
problem
,
for
example
,
your
answer
is
either
correct
or
incorrect
.
At
the
very
most
,
your
process
is
done
a
little
differently
,
but
even
then
,
there
may
be
restrictions
on
the
process
.
Compare
that
to
ethics
,
where
you
essentially
just
debate
whether
something
is
wrong
or
right
and
either
way
,
you’re
not
totally
correct
.
Analytic
intelligence
is
easily
graded
and
progress
can
be
quantified
,
whereas
measuring
how
much
more
creative
you
are
or
how
much
better
you
are
at
writing
is
much
harder
.
In
the
same
vein
,
academic
and
professional
success
are
more
quantifiable
than
other
kinds
of
success
.
Your
academic
success
can
be
measured
by
your
grades
,
and
your
professional
success
can
be
measured
by
the
amount
of
money
you
make
.
But
how
can
you
measure
social
success
?
You
could
see
how
many
friends
you
have
,
but
the
line
between
acquaintance
and
friend
can
be
blurry
,
and
the
degree
of
closeness
complicates
things
even
further
.
How
do
you
measure
the
fulfillment
you
get
from
what
you
do
?
There’s
no
metric
to
decide
how
personally
expressive
and
fulfilling
something
is
,
so
maybe
that’s
why
we’re
often
drawn
to
the
majors
or
careers
that
have
quantifiable
standards
of
success
.
When
we
consider
our
notions
of
academic
and
professional
success
,
we
may
realize
that
we
are
neglecting
how
far
we
have
already
come
.
We
tend
to
have
a
short
sighted
view
of
where
we
are
Duke
students
seen
by
others
are
generally
seen
as
already
academically
successful
and
on
the
way
to
being
professionally
successful
.
There
are
plenty
of
people
whose
definition
of
academic
success
is
making
it
into
college
at
all
,
or
whose
professional
success
is
finally
getting
a
job
,
even
if
it’s
just
above
minimum
wage
.
If
we
zoom
out
beyond
our
immediate
bubble
,
we
can
see
that
we
are
privileged
to
even
consider
success
as
something
beyond
survival
.
What’s
the
use
of
considering
our
definitions
for
success
?
Without
well
rounded
success
,
we
may
not
be
happy
at
all
.
Imagine
your
life
without
family
or
friends
.
Imagine
your
life
without
integrity
.
Imagine
your
life
with
only
work
.
Are
you
happy
with
where
you
are
?
Do
you
see
yourself
as
truly
successful
?
And
if
not
,
are
there
other
kinds
of
intelligence
or
success
you
want
to
cultivate
moving
forward
?

No
matter
how
you
define
being
successful
,
it’s
never
too
late
to
take
control
and
move
towards
that
definition
.
My
pre
med
friend
,
in
her
quest
for
a
4
.
0
,
sacrificed
countless
hours
of
sleep
and
likely
years
off
of
her
life
from
stress
and
fatigue
.
This
summer
,
I
hope
,
will
prove
to
be
a
success
for
her
and
all
Duke
students’
relaxation
and
health
.
I
have
now
read
all
four
parts
of
the
Chronicle's
oral
history
on
the
takeover
of
Allen
Building
.
I
was
there
all
afternoon
on
February
13
,
1969
and
was
involved
in
the
confrontation
with
the
police
after
the
black
students
left
the
building
.
nbsp
;
I'm
concerned
that
the
oral
history
doesn’t
accurately
capture
what
happened
that
afternoon
from
the
perspective
of
many
Duke
students
who
were
there
at
the
time
.
It
implies
that
the
confrontation
with
police
was
with
the
black
students
as
they
exited
the
building
.
It
was
not
.
They
left
,
shouting
We’ll
be
back
and
disappeared
before
the
North
Carolina
State
Highway
patrol
who
entered
Allen
Building
through
a
tunnel
from
the
Duke
Gardens
emerged
from
the
building
.
A
number
of
white
sympathizers
,
who
had
positioned
themselves
on
the
steps
outside
two
public
entrances
,
shouting
,
nbsp
;
you’ll
have
to
go
through
us
to
get
to
our
black
brothers
,
nbsp
;
seemed
confused
about
what
to
do
next
when
the
police
appeared
from
inside
the
building
,
behind
them
.
There
were
several
hundred
students
looking
on
as
the
media
set
up
their
cameras
.
When
the
TV
camera
lights
came
on
,
a
few
of
the
white
student
nbsp
;
sympathizers
nbsp
;
shouted
Sieg
heil
!
Sieg
heil
!
and
heckled
the
police
for
the
cameras
,
insinuating
a
connection
between
the
officers
and
Nazi
Germany
.
nbsp
;
When
the
lights
went
out
,
the
jeering
stopped
.
This
was
repeated
several
times
.
Nobody
was
sure
what
was
going
to
happen
but
it
looked
like
the
confrontation
would
end
in
the
cool
,
coming
darkness
.
nbsp
;
After
several
minutes
,
one
young
woman
walked
up
to
a
helmeted
and
gas
masked
officer
nbsp
;
who
held
nbsp
;
a
pepper
gas
machine
it
sounded
like
a
chain
saw
and
pantomimed
a
suggestive
stroking
of
his
hidden
face
.
nbsp
;
He
looked
confused
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
turned
the
machine
towards
her
and
began
spraying
her
.
That
started
the
riot
.
Several
hundred
students
began
shouting
at
the
police
and
surged
towards
the
building
.
There
was
a
police
car
in
front
of
the
building
and
the
students
attacked
it
.
nbsp
;
The
police
began
moving
toward
the
crowd
,
tear
gas
was
thrown
and
the
students
fell
back
.
The
crowd
and
the
police
surged
back
and
forth
across
the
Main
Quad
in
the
dark
.
When
a
group
of
us
retreated
into
the
Chapel
,
there
was
tear
gas
in
there
too
.
After
10
15
minutes
of
chaos
during
which
the
police
car’s
windows
and
body
work
were
smashed
,
the
police
retreated
into
Allen
Building
and
the
students
stood
outside
screaming
.
Several
students
put
poles
through
the
door
handles
to
make
it
hard
for
the
police
to
get
out
.
After
a
few
minutes
,
Bill
Griffith
,
Dean
of
Students
,
walked
up
to
the
crowd
.
nbsp
;
He
said
that
the
confrontation
needed
to
stop
and
told
the
crowd
to
go
to
Page
Auditorium
.
nbsp
;
Within
a
few
minutes
,
all
the
students
were
in
Page
and
the
shouting
died
away
.
nbsp
;
Then
the
talking
began
.
I
believe
the
police
left
Allen
Building
through
the
tunnel
and
the
University
regained
control
of
the
building
and
its
safe
containing
Nixon’s
law
student
records
.
nbsp
;
Who
knows
.
But
an
important
part
of
the
story
is
the
large
number
of
students
whose
political
views
changed
that
day
.
nbsp
;
Students
frat
guys
,
football
players
,
library
nerds
and
the
curious
coming
back
from
Chem
lab
who
were
standing
around
,
watching
as
the
black
students
left
and
the
sympathizers
performed
for
the
media
,
became
incensed
when
the
police
started
the
riot
.
And
their
anger
was
palpable
for
the
rest
of
the
year
.
nbsp
;
Their
attitudes
were
in
marked
contrast
to
those
on
campus
following
the
Vigil
which
achieved
its
success
through
passive
means
.
The
success
of
the
Vigil
may
have
encouraged
the
black
students
to
demand
that
Duke
do
more
to
meet
their
needs
,
but
there
was
none
of
the
celebratory
mood
that
followed
the
end
of
the
Vigil
.
I
wonder
if
that
connection
has
been
lost
in
the
mists
of
time
or
it
simply
doesn’t
fit
our
current
expectations
about
what
happened
.
Mark
Pinsky
and
I
were
on
the
same
freshman
hall
and
worked
on
the
Chronicle
together
.
He
and
many
on
the
Chronicle
staff
were
associated
with
the
small
group
of
campus
activists
in
the
late
60’s
.
nbsp
;
As
the
oral
history
correctly
points
out
,
the
Chronicle
staff
was
not
disinterested
.
nbsp
;
I
was
on
the
fringe
of
both
groups
and
spent
that
day
trying
to
talk
my
friends
out
of
confrontation
.
nbsp
;
But
the
police
came
expecting
a
confrontation
and
,
in
the
end
,
they
provoked
the
student
violence
.
Please
accept
this
as
an
attempt
to
amplify
the
record
,
not
correct
it
.
Each
of
us
who
was
there
that
day
had
a
particular
experience
.
nbsp
;
The
historical
record
is
not
complete
without
each
one
of
their
perspectives
too
.
Graduation
is
a
week
away
and
everyone
keeps
telling
me
the
same
thing
that
the
real
world
is
a
disappointing
place
,
cramped
with
crowded
subway
commutes
and
crushing
expectations
and
occasional
heartbreak
stirred
in
with
bills
that
have
to
be
paid
on
time
.
I
don’t
want
to
arrive
there
just
yet
.
I
won’t
let
college
be
reduced
to
a
series
of
Instagram
posts
or
squished
into
three
lines
on
my
LinkedIn
profile
.
Not
yet
.
Right
now
I
want
to
sit
back
on
a
picnic
blanket
and
take
in
the
amount
that
I’ve
learned
that
we’ve
all
learned
and
smile
as
widely
as
I
can
.
After
all
,
once
we
leave
here
will
be
no
reason
for
future
Duke
students
to
know
that
in
earlier
days
East
Campus
didn’t
have
air
conditioning
,
and
that
we
once
had
to
swipe
our
Duke
cards
in
order
to
get
into
a
building
instead
of
tap
them
,
and
that
the
Brodhead
Center
for
Campus
Life
was
once
called
West
Union
.
Who
will
be
here
to
remind
them
?
It
hasn’t
always
been
easy
,
though
.
The
expectations
of
attending
Duke
exerts
a
near
constant
pressure
on
us
.
Duke
is
founded
on
the
essential
concept
that
our
education
is
meant
to
prepare
us
to
be
successful
.
To
lead
instead
of
follow
,
to
innovate
and
to
ask
hard
questions
of
the
world
and
then
find
the
answers
without
breaking
a
sweat
.
And
if
you
don’t
,
then
something
is
irreparably
wrong
with
you
.
Often
it
seems
like
there
is
a
message
ingrained
within
every
lab
notebook
and
beneath
all
that
manicured
grass
I
hope
that
my
writing
this
semester
has
shown
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
like
this
always
.
We
can
search
instead
for
magic
,
or
little
love
stories
which
seem
to
bloom
in
every
corner
.
Together
,
we
can
take
a
deep
breath
in
,
and
then
let
it
out
.
We
can
find
home
in
unexpected
places
.
We
can
show
up
and
listen
to
each
other
.
We
can
let
each
other
in
on
secrets
.
We
can
admit
when
we
don’t
know
the
answer
.
A
lot
of
things
at
Duke
try
to
pass
as
normal
.
The
work
hard
,
play
hard
mentality
.
The
mindset
that
you
must
take
the
well
paying
job
over
the
teaching
job
you
love
.
The
idea
that
we
can
treat
housekeeping
staff
and
contract
workers
with
less
dignity
and
respect
than
other
Duke
faculty
and
staff
.
The
general
sense
of
apathy
about
what’s
going
on
in
the
world
beyond
athletics
and
memes
.
It’s
easy
to
go
along
with
these
without
stopping
to
pause
and
think
.
That’s
when
we’ve
got
to
lean
in
and
be
brave
.
I
hope
that
Duke
has
taught
me
over
the
last
four
years
to
do
exactly
that
to
be
brave
.
To
bravely
stand
up
for
others
.
To
bravely
tell
people
I
love
that
I
love
them
.
To
bravely
work
for
justice
for
all
people
.
To
walk
as
bravely
as
I
can
through
hard
times
and
to
bravely
decide
to
believe
that
it
won’t
always
be
that
way
.
The
bravest
thing
I
did
at
Duke
wasn’t
the
time
I
boarded
a
plane
nervously
to
a
new
continent
,
or
raised
my
hand
in
class
to
disagree
with
the
professor
.
It
wasn’t
writing
this
column
,
or
applying
for
a
job
I
wasn’t
qualified
for
.
The
bravest
thing
I
did
at
Duke
happened
on
my
second
day
as
a
student
here
,
the
same
day
that
I
said
goodbye
to
my
parents
and
twin
sister
right
before
they
pulled
away
from
campus
.
I
had
to
go
directly
to
my
group
advising
meeting
with
my
college
advisor
,
and
I
was
such
a
wreck
that
I
had
to
stop
to
sob
in
a
bathroom
stall
on
the
second
floor
of
the
Allen
building
.
The
thought
of
being
here
without
them
was
so
overwhelming
that
I
wanted
to
just
skip
the
meeting
altogether
and
hop
on
the
next
train
back
to
Charlotte
.

That’s
not
what
I
did
,
and
I’ll
be
forever
glad
.
Being
brave
looks
like
showing
up
to
a
meeting
with
wadded
up
tissues
in
hand
.
Being
brave
looks
like
not
being
afraid
to
take
up
space
.
Being
brave
looks
like
making
sure
you
are
heard
.
Now
,
it’s
my
,
and
the
Class
of
2019’s
turn
to
leave
all
of
the
people
and
places
we
are
comfortable
with
at
Duke
and
start
out
on
a
brand
new
journey
.
I
plan
on
leaving
this
home
in
the
exact
same
way
as
the
first
time
I
had
to
leave
home
tearful
and
completely
overwhelmed
.
But
,
Class
of
2019
,
we
already
know
how
to
be
brave
.
It’s
because
of
the
lessons
we
learned
here
and
the
people
we
met
along
the
way
that
I
think
I
know
we’ll
be
just
fine
.
I’ve
got
a
riddle
for
you
,
and
I
promise
it’s
one
that
you’ve
never
heard
before
.
It
goes
a
little
something
like
this
A
Duke
first
year
goes
to
the
East
Campus
Activities
Fair
seeking
to
be
part
of
everything
Duke
has
to
offer
,
but
can
only
sign
up
for
one
student
organization
or
activity
.
What
is
it
?
There
may
be
multiple
acceptable
answers
,
but
I’m
just
here
to
tell
you
about
the
one
that
I
came
up
with
.
Coming
out
of
high
school
,
there
weren’t
many
activities
that
I
knew
I
wanted
to
try
at
Duke
,
but
let’s
just
say
that
I
wasn’t
going
to
go
another
four
years
without
giving
my
campus
publication
a
try
.
And
at
every
turn
and
juncture
these
last
four
years
,
The
Chronicle
has
given
me
a
front
row
seat
to
more
people
,
places
,
issues
and
moments
throughout
my
little
block
of
Duke
history
than
I
ever
imagined
were
possible
for
a
student
like
me
.
I
still
remember
the
days
when
I
would
sit
on
the
sofa
with
my
grandfather
Charles
rest
his
soul
and
tell
him
about
all
of
the
people
I’ve
interfaced
with
during
my
Chronicle
adventures
,
from
new
deans
of
Divinity
,
Pratt
and
Fuqua
to
Doris
Kearns
Goodwin
and
David
Rubenstein
to
dozens
if
not
hundreds
of
Duke
faculty
,
staff
,
and
students
spanning
all
departments
and
majors
and
from
all
corners
of
the
University
.
If
he
were
still
around
today
,
I’d
tell
Charles
about
the
time
when
I
interviewed
Sylvester
Williams
,
a
Durham
mayoral
on
the
eve
of
the
biggest
political
race
of
his
life
,
or
Rodney
Wynkoop
,
who
sat
down
with
me
to
reflect
on
29
years
as
director
of
the
Chapel
choir
and
retired
with
580
concerts
to
show
for
his
to
the
University
.
But
these
are
not
the
only
stories
I
remember
vividly
to
this
day
.
I
remember
the
tears
in
my
eyes
after
I
interviewed
Ashlyn
Sanders
,
Graduate
School
15
MA
in
Bioethics
and
Science
Policy
,
who
overcame
her
neurological
disorder
to
become
the
CEO
of
her
successful
,
NeuroVice
.
I
remember
the
thrill
of
witnessing
a
group
of
protestors
storm
the
Sanford
School
on
the
night
of
former
Secretary
of
Homeland
Security
Jeh
Johnson’s
to
the
American
Grand
Strategy
program
at
Duke
,
and
telling
friends
and
family
all
about
my
adventure
the
following
day
.
And
no
matter
how
old
I
am
,
I
don’t
think
I’ll
forget
my
excitement
as
I
typed
this
lede
But
in
addition
to
all
of
these
interesting
dinner
party
stories
,
the
Chronicle
gave
me
an
avenue
through
which
to
write
about
topics
I
was
passionate
about
topics
that
had
great
implications
for
the
future
of
the
Duke
student
experience
.
After
a
trying
sophomore
fall
,
I
went
on
to
write
about
the
manifestations
of
and
available
resources
for
combatting
the
sophomore
slump
an
that
I
hope
will
go
on
to
benefit
Duke
sophomores
of
tomorrow
.
Another
issue
I
was
passionate
about
was
housing
reform
,
and
thanks
to
The
Chronicle
,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
campus
administrators
and
student
leaders
of
Duke
Students
for
Housing
Reform
DS4HR
alike
regarding
the
of
tangible
,
long
lasting
housing
reform
on
campus
.
Two
springs
ago
,
when
faculty
across
all
departments
came
together
to
discuss
Trinity
curriculum
reform
at
monthly
Arts
amp
;
Sciences
Council
meetings
,
I
was
there
too
,
sitting
in
the
front
row
of
that
Rubenstein
or
Westbrook
auditorium
as
that
might
affect
thousands
of
Duke
students
after
me
.
In
one
very
special
case
,
a
story
that
I
covered
for
The
Chronicle
went
on
to
shape
the
future
of
my
Duke
experience
for
the
better
.
In
September
2015
,
I
covered
the
very
Duke
Conversations
dinner
ever
hosted
by
a
regular
faculty
member
.
I
enjoyed
the
experience
so
much
that
I
had
to
go
to
another
one
.
And
another
.
And
another
one
after
that
.
Now
a
student
organization
on
campus
,
Duke
Conversations
has
gone
on
to
host
hundreds
of
similar
dinners
with
faculty
across
all
departments
with
yours
truly
as
an
outgoing
executive
board
member
.
And
then
there
were
fun
stories
usually
born
out
of
wild
and
crazy
imagination
,
like
giving
up
one
Saturday
afternoon
to
all
of
the
cars
in
Blue
Zone
or
devoting
my
junior
spring
toward
the
sampling
and
of
sixty
five
Brodhead
Center
dishes
;
gauging
student
reactions
to
fads
like
HQ
Trivia
and
Pokémon
Go
and
interviewing
Klaus
Teuber
,
the
founder
and
of
Settlers
of
Catan
;
and
sitting
down
with
a
current
student
who
invented
a
Weasley
clock
replica
I’m
really
gonna
miss
Duke
among
so
many
others
.
Ever
wondered
why
they
call
Duke’s
yearbook
The
Chanticleer
?
Yep
,
I
wrote
about
too
.
During
my
time
with
The
Chronicle
,
there
wasn’t
a
topic
I
couldn’t
have
written
about
if
I
wanted
to
.
And
with
the
bustling
,
stimulating
and
ever
changing
world
of
Duke
University
at
my
fingertips
,
I
wrote
about
all
subjects
,
all
disciplines
and
all
kinds
of
campus
happenings
that
meaningfully
affected
the
student
experience
.
In
fact
,
half
of
the
fun
for
me
was
that
I
never
really
knew
what
my
next
story
would
be
about
.
But
each
time
,
I
secretly
hoped
it
would
open
my
eyes
to
a
new
corner
of
Duke
that
I
had
yet
to
explore
.
More
often
than
not
,
I
got
my
wish
.
Being
part
of
The
Chronicle
was
one
of
the
greatest
investments
of
my
Duke
career
,
because
as
far
as
I’m
concerned
,
it
made
me
a
part
of
everything
.
Another
year
is
coming
to
a
close
,
providing
a
time
for
individuals
and
groups
on
campus
to
reflect
on
the
time
that
has
passed
and
plan
for
the
year
ahead
.
Many
of
us
will
soon
depart
campus
for
internships
or
summer
employment
where
the
traditional
realm
of
academic
integrity
might
not
be
quite
as
relevant
.
Rather
than
being
faced
with
the
decision
to
copy
a
problem
set
or
plagiarize
a
paper
,
we
step
out
of
the
Duke
bubble
and
are
confronted
with
the
tangible
byproducts
of
leading
an
ethical
life
in
very
different
environments
the
ones
we
all
hope
to
enter
following
graduation
the
real
world
,
’
as
they
say
.
Stepping
into
the
real
world’
pushes
us
to
consider
how
the
values
so
emphasized
in
the
academic
setting
can
also
be
transferable
to
communities
around
us
.
We
begin
to
evaluate
relationships
,
cultural
contexts
,
and
incidents
through
a
lens
that
is
not
always
emphasized
on
a
college
campus
as
we
think
about
employer
employee
dynamics
,
the
communities
in
which
we
are
working
,
and
the
issues
we
hope
to
address
throughout
the
summer
.
But
why
wait
to
think
seriously
about
these
topics
?
Issues
such
as
inappropriate
power
dynamics
,
gender
based
violence
,
or
acts
of
hate
and
bias
are
not
any
less
relevant
on
campus
.
Arguably
,
some
might
be
even
more
relevant
here
than
in
the
real
world
,
’
as
has
been
made
clear
throughout
an
academic
year
tainted
by
multiple
acts
of
hate
speech
and
alarming
findings
from
reports
surrounding
campus
life
.
These
values
are
inextricably
linked
to
creating
honorable
communities
and
it
is
important
to
proactively
target
the
underlying
issues
from
the
moment
students
step
foot
on
campus
.
Honor
Council’s
fundamental
purpose
on
Duke’s
campus
is
to
foster
dialogue
and
advocate
for
policy
change
that
will
create
a
more
level
playing
field
for
members
of
the
community
whether
it
be
ensuring
certain
students
don’t
have
heightened
access
to
previous
exams
,
making
sure
everyone’s
votes
are
considered
in
elections
,
or
working
to
create
a
campus
environment
that
allows
all
students
to
reach
their
highest
potential
.
This
year
,
Honor
Council
has
broadened
our
focus
by
creating
three
Focus
Areas
Academic
Integrity
,
’
Social
Life
,
’
and
Beyond
Duke
,
’
which
has
allowed
us
to
address
a
variety
of
issues
and
highlight
the
critical
importance
of
proselytizing
ethical
values
in
every
corner
of
life
.
In
the
upcoming
academic
year
,
Council
hopes
to
continue
these
conversations
about
the
role
of
integrity
in
regard
to
various
campus
issues
both
within
,
and
extending
beyond
,
the
classroom
.
Please
feel
free
to
reach
out
with
any
questions
,
comments
,
or
concerns
to
.
I
have
lived
a
Duke
haunted
by
both
a
coyly
expressed
frustration
with
the
lack
of
residential
community
for
all
students
,
and
the
prominence
of
exclusive
groups
granted
housing
privileges
.
Selective
housing
precludes
all
encompassing
residential
houses
wherein
a
grounded
parity
may
be
nurtured
by
intentional
programmatic
efforts
.
My
ideal
housing
model
guarantees
on
campus
housing
for
four
years
,
retains
a
first
year
only
campus
,
and
shuffles
first
years
into
randomly
comprised
houses
on
West
Campus
.
All
houses
would
have
an
identity
the
members
define
for
themselves
,
distinct
traditions
,
the
capacity
to
host
on
campus
parties
,
and
not
be
permitted
to
exclude
students
from
entering
said
parties
.
At
Duke
,
while
students
find
community
in
an
array
of
co
curriculars
and
even
academic
pursuits
,
the
fact
remains
the
current
residential
house
model
with
housing
privileges
reserved
for
selective
groups
is
toxic
.
The
model
undermines
the
very
principles
of
an
inclusive
and
diverse
undergraduate
experience
.
As
a
resident
assistant
RA
,
these
issues
have
been
particularly
salient
in
my
Duke
life
.
I
often
hear
students
call
Kilgo
Quad
,
where
I
have
worked
as
a
RA
for
three
years
,
the
perfect
dorm
.
We
have
a
history
of
high
performance
on
the
annual
Resident
Feedback
Survey
sent
to
students
in
October
,
conveniently
after
RAs
are
mandated
to
host
six
programs
in
the
first
six
weeks
of
the
semester
.
Struggling
with
the
burden
of
their
own
adjustment
to
the
semester
,
RAs
put
their
needs
aside
to
perform
this
emotional
labor
.
Kilgo
is
also
known
for
the
RA
hosted
monthly
Sunday
Sundae
series
,
which
brings
together
residents
of
the
quad
for
a
waffle
sundae
buffet
.
In
spite
of
such
programmatic
innovations
,
which
have
taken
off
across
West
Campus
,
there
is
a
concrete
obstacle
to
community
building
in
independent
houses
selective
housing
.
There
will
never
be
parity
in
our
housing
model
as
long
as
certain
students
are
allowed
to
exclude
their
peers
from
housing
.
I
say
this
as
a
student
who
joined
a
selective
living
group
my
freshman
year
and
as
an
RA
in
an
active
independent
house
named
Avalon
.
Students
come
to
Sundae
Sunday
alone
or
in
their
friend
clusters
,
and
leave
as
such
.
My
best
attempts
to
socialize
and
introduce
students
to
one
another
have
borne
few
friendships
.
Kilgo
Rush
,
a
month
of
all
inclusive
events
to
celebrate
the
Kilgo
community
amidst
the
selective
group
recruitment
season
,
is
a
temporary
symbolic
fix
to
a
deeper
institutional
level
issue
.
At
the
start
of
the
2018
19
academic
year
,
half
the
Kilgo
team
was
filled
with
RAs
who
had
not
lived
there
before
;
some
were
new
juniors
coming
out
of
isolating
experiences
as
sophomores
on
West
.
We
have
had
our
fair
share
of
team
arguments
rooted
in
frustration
over
cleaning
the
waffle
iron
or
how
some
people
were
not
showing
up
to
Sundae
Sunday
shifts
.
We
are
far
,
far
from
perfect
,
if
such
a
thing
exists
.
Idealized
of
our
community
has
masked
unfortunate
realities
.
Housing
and
Residence
Life’s
expectation
that
RAs
ensure
every
student
feels
like
they
are
accepted
and
belong
in
their
residential
house
,
in
as
structurally
divisive
a
place
as
Duke
,
is
beyond
lofty
.
I
have
had
a
sense
that
upperclassmen
on
West
Campus
,
once
graduated
from
the
first
year
campus
where
RA
resident
relationships
tend
to
be
stronger
,
would
rather
hide
in
their
rooms
than
be
spotted
at
an
RA
program
.
Do
not
get
me
wrong
,
RAs
do
their
jobs
.
My
role
as
an
RA
has
been
one
of
my
most
fulfilling
and
meaningful
experiences
as
student
leader
.
Still
,
what
the
University
asks
of
independent
house
RAs
is
unattainable
insofar
as
selectiving
living
arrangements
endure
.
Founding
Duke
Students
for
Housing
Reform
DS4HR
altered
the
course
of
my
personal
development
.
Through
DS4HR
I
organized
with
a
diversity
of
students
who
spoke
to
their
dissatisfaction
.
In
fact
,
the
founding
group
of
DS4HR
included
several
members
of
Greek
organizations
.
Still
,
there
is
a
strong
taboo
against
articulating
these
sentiments
.
This
is
all
to
say
that
I
know
this
issue
well
I
have
talked
to
hundreds
of
students
about
their
dissatisfaction
with
the
Duke
residential
experience
.
We
need
radical
change
in
Duke’s
culture
,
and
we
needed
it
yesterday
.
My
hope
is
that
one
day
,
Duke’s
social
culture
will
mirror
that
of
a
liberal
arts
college
with
no
selective
life
presence
and
greater
respectful
and
productive
exchanges
between
all
students
,
with
no
barriers
to
communication
at
all
.
One
of
my
best
friends
is
a
senior
at
Davidson
College
.
Each
time
I
visit
her
,
I
leave
wishing
I
had
applied
to
her
school
,
where
no
student
groups
have
selective
housing
and
where
social
events
that
all
tend
to
safely
occur
on
campus
are
open
.
Future
generations
of
Duke
students
do
not
need
to
experience
the
exclusive
,
convoluted
,
monopolistic
,
and
alienating
social
experience
that
so
many
of
us
are
unable
or
afraid
to
call
out
.

Culture
change
begins
and
ends
with
brutal
honesty
at
the
individual
level
.
As
I
leave
campus
an
alumna
,
I
carry
utmost
trust
in
the
Duke
students
who
will
drive
this
change
forward
.
It
may
sound
unlikely
,
but
it’s
a
request
made
with
varying
degrees
of
extremity
by
participants
in
,
an
organization
at
Duke
that
enables
students
to
be
shareholders
and
directors
of
their
own
businesses
.
But
CE
prompts
an
ethical
question
does
its
mandatory
7
,
000
buy
in
investment
in
the
company
promote
and
sustain
elitism
?
While
discusses
the
long
hours
and
hard
work
necessary
to
promote
their
brand
,
the
hard
truth
is
that
the
organization
could
not
achieve
success
without
a
big
fat
check
from
mom
and
dad
.
This
brings
to
mind
an
old
adage
he
was
born
on
third
base
and
thinks
he
hit
a
triple
.
In
the
case
of
CE
,
the
7
,
000
buy
in
allows
shareholders
to
advance
several
bases
from
the
get
go
.
They
certainly
don’t
start
in
the
batter’s
box
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
the
students
who
run
CE
do
not
work
tirelessly
to
promote
their
company
.
How
many
Instagram
stories
of
sushi
rolls
and
storage
boxes
have
you
seen
in
the
last
few
weeks
?
In
theory
,
the
shareholder
investment
is
useful
in
some
respects
.
Having
skin
in
the
game
is
an
incentive
for
CE
participants
to
be
more
conscientious
in
running
their
business
.
When
they
field
a
complaint
about
a
loose
mattress
spring
,
their
financial
stake
in
the
enterprise
is
a
motivation
to
be
more
responsive
.
But
do
they
have
skin
in
the
game
?
One
has
to
wonder
how
many
CE
shareholders
actually
saved
that
7
,
000
,
perhaps
by
lifeguarding
the
kiddy
pool
or
deep
frying
Chick
fil
A
patties
.
Although
there
are
no
hard
numbers
on
this
,
it
stands
to
reason
that
parents
,
not
college
students
,
forked
over
the
money
.
It’s
a
huge
privilege
to
step
into
an
established
business
at
the
level
of
CE
,
instead
of
working
one’s
way
up
from
the
bottom
.
A
typical
aspiring
entrepreneur
must
build
a
business
from
scratch
,
rising
up
from
humble
beginnings
.
She
must
start
out
on
the
ground
floor
,
working
as
a
barista
by
day
to
support
herself
and
fund
her
start
up
.
Alternatively
,
she
may
create
a
persuasive
and
enticing
Kickstarter
campaign
,
seeking
money
from
strangers
who
are
willing
to
invest
in
her
fine
tuned
business
model
.
Meanwhile
,
CE
participants
are
afforded
the
luxury
of
just
calling
home
,
or
maybe
even
texting
Dad
to
Venmo
them
7
,
000
.
They
enter
a
lofty
realm
,
where
they
can
run
a
business
at
the
mere
age
of
19
without
having
much
to
lose
.
Like
many
things
in
life
,
if
we’re
honest
with
ourselves
,
it
is
elitist
,
even
if
we
would
like
to
be
a
part
of
it
.
CE
participants
will
develop
business
skills
and
acumen
,
which
are
to
be
envied
.
As
a
matter
of
full
disclosure
,
my
application
to
join
CE
was
rejected
.
Given
the
,
the
7
,
000
buy
in
is
a
pittance
for
those
at
the
upper
end
of
the
economic
ladder
and
a
fortune
for
those
at
the
bottom
.
Consequently
,
the
buy
in
tends
to
winnow
the
pool
of
potential
applicants
to
those
with
more
resources
.
To
their
credit
,
CE
recognizes
that
a
costly
buy
in
is
problematic
and
is
taking
steps
to
make
the
organization
more
egalitarian
.
Asked
whether
the
investment
tends
to
draw
more
affluent
participants
,
CE’s
Chief
Executive
Officer
Josh
Young
candidly
replied
,
It
does
,
and
that’s
why
we’re
really
trying
to
lower
it
.
.
.
Our
goal
is
to
continue
to
bring
it
down
over
the
next
5
to
10
years
until
it’s
close
to
0
.
At
one
point
,
CE’s
shareholder
price
was
over
10
,
000
,
which
Young
acknowledges
was
not
reasonable
for
college
students
to
afford
.
Although
CE
would
like
to
eliminate
the
buy
in
,
a
shareholder
investment
is
still
necessary
at
the
moment
so
that
current
members
are
reimbursed
with
at
least
the
same
amount
that
they
paid
to
buy
in
.

According
to
the
CE
Prospectus
,
In
2019
,
we
have
committed
to
reducing
the
share
price
to
6
,
500
.
This
is
the
price
incoming
shareholders
of
the
Class
of
2022
will
pay
to
join
the
company
.
However
,
that
did
not
happen
.
The
final
share
price
in
2019
was
7
,
000
,
the
same
as
it
was
in
2018
.
Ironically
,
one
reason
that
the
buy
in
was
not
lowered
was
that
CE
gave
out
more
financial
aid
than
ever
before
to
subsidize
the
buy
in
for
accepted
applicants
,
who
were
unable
to
make
the
investment
.
Refunding
the
buy
in
to
graduating
seniors
and
providing
financial
assistance
to
new
members
required
revenue
,
foreclosing
any
lowering
of
the
buy
in
.
Young
said
,
We
offered
financial
aid
to
six
out
of
the
15
that
got
in
We
gave
out
almost
30
,
000
.
.
.
which
is
a
pretty
large
amount
.
The
CE
Prospectus
says
,
Please
state
on
your
application
in
the
additional
information
section
if
the
share
price
is
prohibitive
so
that
we
can
plan
ahead
to
accommodate
.
This
will
not
affect
our
consideration
of
you
as
a
candidate
.
According
to
Young
,
the
reading
of
the
application
is
need
blind
.
But
how
exactly
is
need
blind
defined
?
Does
it
mean
that
financial
need
will
not
be
a
factor
,
or
that
the
admissions
committee
will
be
completely
unaware
of
applicants’
financial
status
?
It’s
obviously
not
the
latter
,
because
the
Google
Doc
based
application
has
no
way
of
filtering
mention
of
financial
need
.
But
since
it’s
in
the
application
,
how
could
financial
need
afford
participation
,
not
only
declining
to
participate
,
but
also
boycotting
CE’s
products
and
services
is
the
best
way
to
express
disapproval
.
This
is
not
a
knock
on
the
qualifications
of
those
selected
for
CE
.
It’s
an
observation
about
the
quality
of
all
the
people
excluded
by
virtue
of
the
buy
in
.
I
believe
in
the
inherent
goodness
of
all
people
.
We’re
all
born
good
I
mean
,
we
have
to
be
.
It’s
not
like
anyone
has
a
genetic
predisposition
to
be
nasty
or
rude
.
Somewhere
around
my
fifteenth
birthday
,
I
vowed
that
,
no
matter
what
,
I
wanted
to
be
a
good
,
kind
person
.
Coming
to
Duke
,
I
tried
to
keep
this
vow
.
I
quickly
learned
I
would
never
be
the
smartest
,
prettiest
,
funniest
or
most
accomplished
person
in
the
room
,
but
I
could
do
my
best
to
be
genuinely
kind
.
As
soon
as
I
received
my
acceptance
letter
,
I
was
ready
to
leave
high
school
and
completely
immerse
myself
in
the
world
of
Duke
.
I
pored
through
blogs
,
followed
Duke
affiliated
Instagram
accounts
and
regularly
kept
up
with
The
Chronicle
.
One
day
,
I
discovered
Monday
Monday
.
I
vowed
that
,
before
I
graduated
,
I
would
spend
a
semester
writing
as
Duke’s
anonymous
satirical
columnist
.
Over
the
course
of
my
freshman
year
,
I
nearly
failed
one
course
,
withdrew
from
another
,
made
what
I
thought
would
be
the
best
friends
of
my
life
,
gradually
lost
those
friends
,
found
my
family
,
discovered
a
major
I
love
and
participated
in
far
too
many
extracurriculars
.
Through
all
these
ups
and
downs
,
I
still
struggled
to
find
my
footing
I
spent
so
much
time
trying
to
be
who
Duke
wanted
me
to
be
,
that
I
didn’t
know
who
wanted
to
be
.
I
started
my
sophomore
year
with
an
overwhelming
aura
of
uncertainty
.
Though
my
summer
was
relaxing
,
it
was
stagnant
and
I
didn’t
grow
or
change
in
the
ways
I
thought
would
prepare
me
for
the
future
.
I
spent
the
first
semester
straddling
two
identities
who
I
thought
I
was
and
who
I
wanted
to
be
,
neither
of
which
really
fit
my
schema
of
a
Duke
student
.
In
doing
this
,
I
felt
myself
becoming
an
observer
of
my
own
life
,
rather
than
a
participant
.
Somewhere
in
this
blur
of
a
semester
,
I
decided
I
would
dedicate
my
Spring
to
doing
things
that
I
wanted
to
do
,
even
if
they
didn’t
necessarily
relate
to
my
major
intended
career
literally
anything
else
.
Part
of
this
decision
was
a
renewal
of
my
high
school
vow
I
applied
to
be
Monday
Monday
.
I
spent
the
month
between
submitting
my
application
and
hearing
back
from
The
Chronicle
frantically
checking
my
email
,
hoping
to
finally
actualize
18
year
old
me’s
pipe
dream
.
I
eventually
heard
back
on
Christmas
Eve
,
and
I
couldn’t
have
asked
for
a
better
gift
.
The
rest
of
my
Winter
Break
consisted
of
enthusiastic
brainstorming
for
my
debut
column
,
giddy
preparation
for
what
I
thought
would
be
the
semester
of
my
dreams
.
After
publishing
my
first
column
,
I
was
hooked
.
I
had
finally
found
the
perfect
medium
to
vent
the
infinite
frustrations
I
felt
on
Duke’s
campus
.
Even
better
,
I
could
be
harshly
critical
and
no
one
would
know
it
was
me
.
For
the
first
month
of
Spring
semester
,
Monday
Monday
became
my
number
one
source
of
dealing
with
the
insurmountable
stress
that
accompanies
life
at
Duke
I
think
this
is
where
everything
started
to
go
wrong
.
After
my
Young
Trustee
column
went
live
,
one
of
my
roommates
an
avid
Chronicle
reader
texted
me
,
asking
if
I
read
the
week’s
Monday
Monday
.
She
wanted
to
hear
my
take
on
it
,
calling
the
column
SO
aggressive
and
disproportionately
mean
.
I
was
in
shock
.
There
are
a
lot
of
negative
words
I
would
and
do
use
to
describe
myself
,
but
aggressive
and
mean
were
not
in
that
vernacular
.
Was
I
still
a
good
person
?
In
attempting
to
cope
with
my
everyday
life
,
did
I
somehow
abandon
the
one
character
trait
I
truly
valued
?
As
the
semester
progressed
,
I
couldn’t
sit
down
to
write
my
column
without
feeling
sick
to
my
stomach
.
The
only
thing
I
could
think
about
was
that
,
once
my
identity
was
revealed
,
everyone
would
think
I
was
a
huge
f
b
.
Everything
I
tried
to
write
felt
vaguely
to
moderately
hypocritical
how
could
I
make
fun
of
first
years
crying
over
sorority
rush
when
I
had
done
the
same
thing
just
last
year
?
How
could
I
provide
a
healthy
critique
on
would
eventually
participate
in
during
my
collegiate
career
?
Eventually
,
this
sense
of
dread
consumed
me
entirely
.
I
asked
to
have
my
column
pushed
back
a
week
.
.
.
and
a
week
turned
into
a
month
,
which
turned
into
two
months
,
and
,
suddenly
,
the
semester
ended
.
I
had
written
a
grand
total
of
three
columns
,
and
I
felt
like
a
massive
failure
.
I
failed
The
Chronicle
,
my
editors
,
and
myself
.
I
wasn’t
sure
which
felt
worst
.
I
wanted
Monday
Monday
to
be
my
way
out
of
my
problems
.
I
treated
it
like
a
one
size
fits
all
,
Band
Aid
solution
to
the
myriad
challenges
I
so
desperately
wanted
to
ignore
.
Rather
than
turning
my
stress
into
humor
,
I
channeled
it
into
vitriol
and
spite
,
losing
sight
of
who
I
still
think
I
could
be
.
Maybe
I
just
wasn’t
the
right
person
for
the
job
.
My
parents
have
always
told
me
that
I’m
too
sensitive
.
Nevertheless
,
I
learned
.
I
confronted
my
worst
self
,
and
I
think
I’m
now
better
for
it
.
I
just
hope
you
all
got
some
laughs
along
the
way
.

There
are
a
couple
of
things
I
want
to
get
off
my
chest
in
my
last
column
of
the
year
.
The
first
is
that
,
like
every
other
column
,
this
one
is
being
written
at
the
absolute
last
minute
.
I
have
been
holding
this
idea
in
for
the
last
two
weeks
and
have
found
zero
time
between
then
and
now
to
put
pen
to
paper
.
Despite
that
,
the
way
my
life
has
played
out
since
joining
The
Chronicle
has
been
nothing
short
of
poetic
.
For
those
unfamiliar
with
the
process
,
you
cannot
just
wake
up
and
decide
you
want
to
write
for
the
opinion
section
of
The
Chronicle
.
There
is
an
application
process
.
Along
with
basic
background
questions
,
the
opinion
editor
asks
you
to
submit
a
piece
of
writing
so
that
they
can
evaluate
what
you
might
bring
to
the
table
.
Having
never
written
opinion
pieces
before
this
year
my
second
end
of
the
year
confession
I
had
to
come
up
with
something
on
the
spot
.
Lucky
for
me
,
I
applied
mere
days
after
Beyoncé’s
iconic
Coachella
performance
.
Right
on
brand
,
I
wrote
a
jumbled
,
messy
,
error
ridden
column
about
what
Beychella
meant
for
my
academic
journey
.
In
it
,
I
reflected
on
my
college
application
process
,
what
drove
me
to
turn
down
going
to
Howard
University
,
and
the
collective
black
cultural
experience
I
felt
was
lacking
at
Duke
.
At
this
point
last
year
,
I
was
confused
about
why
I
had
come
to
Duke
.
I
wasn’t
sure
I
would
stay
here
long
enough
to
even
write
my
first
column
.
But
,
I
persisted
.
I
came
into
my
fall
semester
ready
to
experience
a
side
of
Duke
I
didn’t
see
my
first
year
and
I
hoped
this
column
would
help
me
make
sense
of
my
renewed
experience
.
However
,
I
quickly
learned
that
despite
my
desire
for
new
experiences
,
Duke
would
not
be
changing
.
Duke
is
still
a
place
that
openly
struggles
with
prejudice
.
Duke
is
still
a
place
where
students
have
to
fight
for
their
right
to
community
even
those
who
win
the
lottery
of
rush
.
Duke
is
still
a
place
that
demands
students
pay
a
high
price
for
a
meaningful
experience
.
Having
realized
little
had
changed
in
the
three
months
I
was
away
for
summer
break
,
I
quickly
grew
exhausted
with
going
through
the
motions
here
at
Duke
.
Fed
up
with
what
felt
like
a
stagnant
experience
,
I
asked
all
of
you
where
to
go
on
campus
when
you
need
a
bit
of
a
reprieve
.
Since
early
February
,
I
have
been
exploring
every
inch
of
this
campus
for
an
answer
.
My
wandering
took
me
from
the
corners
of
the
law
school
to
the
bushes
of
the
gardens
to
the
common
rooms
of
Trinity
dorm
,
and
I
have
still
come
up
short
.
I
don’t
think
there
is
a
place
on
campus
where
you
can
truly
disappear
and
evade
everything
that
comes
along
with
being
a
Duke
student
.
I
was
all
but
ready
to
give
up
on
my
search
for
an
escape
,
but
then
she
did
it
again
.
Beyoncé
re
released
Beychella
,
this
time
on
Netflix
.
Once
again
I
stayed
up
until
3
a
.
m
.
to
watch
a
performance
I
had
seen
over
twenty
times
since
its
debut
.
This
time
,
I
took
a
different
lesson
away
from
the
greatest
show
the
desert
has
ever
seen
.
Instead
of
reflecting
on
my
choice
of
school
,
I
began
reflecting
on
my
sense
of
belonging
in
where
I
call
home
.
The
conclusion
that
has
stayed
constant
over
the
past
year
my
third
confession
is
that
Duke
is
not
my
home
.
I
will
only
be
here
for
two
more
years
,
and
when
those
years
are
over
,
I’ll
walk
away
without
looking
back
.
What
has
changed
,
however
,
is
that
I
have
come
to
realize
that
home
is
not
just
a
place
.
Home
is
found
in
the
people
who
make
you
feel
included
.
Home
is
the
couch
in
my
research
lab
.
Home
is
the
long
walk
to
the
law
school
library
.
Home
,
here
,
are
the
small
slices
of
my
day
that
remind
me
that
it
will
all
be
worth
it
when
I
walk
across
the
graduation
stage
in
two
years
.
More
than
that
,
though
,
home
reminds
me
who
I
am
and
why
I
left
Houston
in
the
first
place
.
Over
the
past
year
,
I’ve
wrestled
with
a
sober
reality
in
front
of
all
of
you
Duke
is
not
home
.
I
lost
my
sense
of
self
and
my
sense
of
purpose
in
the
two
years
I
have
been
here
.
So
now
,
as
I
conclude
my
finals
and
pack
my
boxes
,
I
prepare
for
my
own
Homecoming
in
the
hopes
that
three
months
in
Texas
will
show
me
just
why
I
sought
Duke
out
in
the
first
place
.
My
final
confession
,
however
,
is
that
no
matter
where
I
go
,
I
don’t
think
I’ll
ever
feel
like
I
belong
in
a
place
that
isn’t
my
home
in
Texas
.
The
Undergraduate
Environmental
Union
formally
endorses
Luke
Farrell
as
Young
Trustee
.
The
Undergraduate
Environmental
Union
UEU
consists
of
11
student
environmental
organizations
Duke
Campus
Farm
,
Duke
Climate
Coalition
,
Duke
Energy
Club
,
Environmental
Alliance
,
Duke
Conservation
Technology
,
Duke
Student
Government

amp
;
Sustainability
Committee
,
Food
for
Thought
,
Duke
Smart
Home
,
Duke
Sustainable
Ocean
Alliance
,
and
Green
Devils
.
We
appreciated
each
candidate’s
attentiveness
to
Duke’s
environmental
footprint
and
their
willingness
to
make
Duke
a
leader
in
sustainability
.
We
concluded
that
Luke’s
history
of
engagement
on
environmental
issues
and
his
fluency
with
high
impact
areas
of
environmental
action
set
him
apart
as
a
candidate
and
earned
unanimous
endorsement
from
the
UEU
members
.
Through
his
appointment
to
the
Advisory
Committee
on
Investment
Responsibility
,
Luke
has
worked
to
divest
the
Duke
University
endowment
from
fossil
fuels
,
to
ensure
that
Duke’s
finances
are
aligned
with
the
urgent
need
to
address
the
climate
crisis
.
He
has
proven
himself
to
be
a
committed
and
persuasive
advocate
for
climate
action
,
able
to
emphasize
the
ethical
benefits
of
environmental
action
and
to
dispel
misconceptions
.
We
were
also
heartened
to
hear
Luke’s
interest
in
leveraging
Duke
University’s
political
influence
to
advocate
for
renewable
energy
policy
reform
,
which
will
be
critical
to
unlock
more
affordable
environmental
solutions
.
We
hope
Luke
will
continue
to
refine
his
environmental
mission
to
emphasize
ambitious
improvements
in
Duke’s
operations
on
campus
and
Duke’s
impact
on
surrounding
communities
.
A
common
value
defines
the
Duke
experience
.
It
pops
up
on
path
signs
around
Cameron
and
Wallace
Wade
Stadiums
.
Proudly
and
prominently
,
it
marquees
on
basically
every
item
of
Duke
promotional
material
and
across
Duke’s
expansive
web
presence
.
In
the
many
notifications
from
President
Price
and
the
occupants
of
the
Allen
building
,
the
administration
often
reaffirms
its
commitment
to
this
value
diversity
.
Far
from
a
top
down
phenomenon
,
the
value
of
diversity
is
strongly
agreed
upon
by
administrators
,
faculty
,
and
students
alike
.
For
instance
,
each
of
the
candidates
for
Young
Trustee
made
consistent
overtures
to
the
value
of
diversity
during
the
campaign
.
If
there
is
any
unease
surrounding
the
Duke
consensus
on
diversity
,
it
comes
from
the
more
ardent
proponents
who
think
the
administration
does
not
go
far
enough
towards
promoting
diversity
.
Marching
in
lockstep
,
the
collective
of
Duke
University
is
apparently
united
in
its
commitment
to
diversity
.
But
talk
is
cheap
.
As
many
in
the
Chronicle
have
argued
,
what
Duke
students
want
are
actionable
policies
that
promote
diversity
,
not
further
rhetorical
kowtowing
to
idealistic
abstractions
.
The
next
step
towards
a
tangibly
diverse
Duke
could
come
through
housing
reform
;
the
University’s
management
of
this
process
will
be
crucial
.
Consequently
,
to
materially
realize
Duke’s
value
of
diversity
,
we
should
liberalize
the
process
of
chartering
new
selective
,
social
organizations
.
As
it
currently
stands
,
many
advocates
of
housing
reform
propose
ending
selective
social
arrangements
.
They
argue
that
selectivity
sours
the
independent
experience
,
that
selective
groups
on
campus
,
and
Greek
Life
in
particular
,
are
often
not
representative
of
the
broader
community
,
and
that
selective
living
creates
social
stratification
on
Duke’s
campus
.
To
remedy
these
social
ills
,
Duke
Students
for
Housing
Reform
proposes
several
potential
options
for
the
structure
of
housing
at
Duke
,
including
a
Linking
Model
,
a
Match
Model
,
and
a
Random
Assignment
Model
.
The
proposals
vary
slightly
,
but
they
are
united
in
that
all
three
involve
ending
selective
housing
at
Duke
,
taking
the
power
to
determine
housing
away
from
students
and
leaving
it
up
to
either
chance
,
algorithms
or
the
administration
,
and
drastically
limiting
the
housing
options
available
to
students
in
favor
of
a
singular
model
.
What
is
confusing
about
the
proponents
of
housing
reform
is
that
they
claim
their
movement
will
promote
diversity
at
Duke
.
Somehow
,
a
one
size
fits
all
,
homogenized
housing
system
that
treats
Duke
students
like
demographic
widgets
who
need
to
be
allocated
according
to
chance
or
the
whims
of
an
algorithm
or
some
greater
plan
concocted
by
the
administration
promotes
diversity
.
After
all
,
how
committed
are
we
to
diversity
if
we
do
not
allow
different
students
with
different
interests
,
aspirations
and
needs
to
make
different
choices
?
A
housing
system
that
empowers
a
diverse
student
body
to
make
different
decisions
for
differing
reasons
represents
a
tangible
embodiment
of
diversity
!
I
would
assume
every
Duke
student
knows
themselves
better
than
anyone
else
.
Yet
according
to
the
sages
of
housing
reform
,
we
cannot
be
trusted
to
take
this
knowledge
of
self
and
make
a
choice
about
where
and
how
to
live
.
Apparently
,
Duke’s
student
body
is
not
entitled
to
the
tangible
expression
of
its
diversity
in
the
form
of
different
living
arrangements
because
self
appointed
experts
know
better
.
We
allow
for
students
to
make
critically
important
choices
for
themselves
on
a
number
of
decisions
like
major
,
career
,
nutrition
,
exercise
,
internships
,
club
membership
,
etc
.
why
should
housing
be
the
exception
?
Duke
students
are
knowledgeable
,
passionate
and
driven
adults
,
and
we
should
be
treated
with
the
respect
and
agency
we
deserve
.
The
system
that
the
housing
reform
movement
proposes
leans
too
far
in
one
direction
.
What
they
have
proposed
eliminates
all
the
interesting
distinctions
and
peculiarities
of
Duke’s
social
scene
in
favor
of
bland
uniformity
.
Such
a
system
would
be
radically
inclusive
all
would
be
enveloped
regardless
of
preference
,
but
it
would
not
be
diverse
.
Instead
of
establishing
a
drab
,
homogenous
housing
system
,
I
propose
we
allow
for
new
arrangements
.
Rather
than
leaving
the
allocation
of
housing
up
to
some
external
entity
,
let’s
make
a
simple
,
smart
choice
students
should
choose
for
themselves
.
To
make
this
vision
a
reality
,
the
barriers
to
forming
an
SLG
or
Greek
organization
should
be
substantially
lowered
so
that
more
Duke
students
feel
empowered
to
form
unique
communities
to
call
their
own
.
If
you
want
to
form
an
SLG
dedicated
to
fostering
a
community
for
LGBT
people
,
go
for
it
.
If
you
want
to
revive
a
defunct
fraternity
chapter
,
by
all
means
.
If
another
arrangement
is
best
for
you
,
then
form
a
new
organization
that
caters
to
an
underserved
community
on
campus
,
whatever
that
may
be
.
However
students
organize
themselves
and
express
their
preferences
,
they
should
be
able
to
do
that
with
as
few
restrictions
as
possible
.
Moreover
,
students
should
be
empowered
to
experiment
with
new
forms
of
social
organizations
beyond
simply
SLGs
and
Greek
life
.
In
fact
,
it
has
already
been
attempted
!
The
students
behind
Hyde
House
tried
just
this
when
they
proposed
the
establishment
of
a
Selective
Social
Group
SSG
a
social
group
that
chooses
its
own
members
much
like
SLGs
but
is
not
tied
to
housing
.
Despite
Hyde
House’s
potential
to
open
new
social
opportunities
for
Duke
students
,
DSG
voted
23
19
against
chartering
Hyde
House
.
One
senator
argued
that
chartering
Hyde
House
would
push
the
conversation
around
Duke's
social
scene
further
away
from
improving
independent
housing
.
Hyde
House
is
a
perfect
example
of
how
to
improve
independent
housing
!
If
we
had
a
variety
of
SSGs
to
accompany
our
many
SLGs
and
Greek
organizations
,
then
Duke
would
feature
an
array
of
social
organizations
unrivaled
at
most
colleges
.
Yet
the
Housing
Reform
movement
proposes
we
shun
that
which
makes
Duke
unique
our
diversified
housing
system
in
favor
of
a
crude
imitation
of
the
housing
systems
of
Harvard
,
Yale
,
and
the
Ivy
League
.
So
much
for
the
Duke
Difference
.
Admittedly
,
the
existence
of
selective
social
groups
necessitates
that
some
students
will
be
left
out
I
should
know
,
my
freshman
rush
was
unsuccessful
.
But
before
lamenting
the
plight
of
independents
,
remember
that
some
people
genuinely
prefer
to
be
unaffiliated
.
And
for
those
who
do
not
,
we
owe
them
serious
action
.
We
need
to
make
selective
groups
more
accessible
by
increasing
their
numbers
.
Duke
should
allow
for
the
creation
of
as
many
SLGs
,
Greek
organizations
,
SSGs
,
and
any
other
social
organizations
that
students
innovate
.
They
should
be
chartered
with
great
efficiency
.
Finally
,
either
through
administration
policy
,
or
through
the
individual
selective
groups
themselves
,
we
must
ensure
that
financial
limitations
do
not
inhibit
the
social
opportunities
of
low
SES
students
.
My
challenge
is
this
if
diversity
is
our
strength
,
then
we
should
act
like
it
.
If
we
claim
to
value
diversity
,
then
we
should
be
comfortable
with
the
product
of
diverse
people
making
different
social
choices
according
to
their
preference
.
Our
commitment
to
student
diversity
cannot
be
merely
ornamental
,
it
must
be
actual
.
It
is
not
enough
that
people
of
all
colors
,
creeds
and
backgrounds
exist
at
Duke
;
we
must
also
allow
them
to
express
that
diversity
in
their
social
arrangements
and
choices
.
The
diversity
of
Duke’s
students
must
be
matched
by
the
diversity
of
social
organizations
available
.
The
power
to
shape
Duke
society
should
be
in
the
hands
of
students
,
not
algorithms
and
administrators
.
I
used
to
think
that
I
wore
makeup
to
make
myself
feel
good
.
But
when
I
realized
I
was
afraid
to
leave
my
dorm
room
with
a
bare
face
,
I
had
to
admit
there
was
something
else
going
on
.
Every
morning
,
I
cover
my
skin
in
foundation
,
fill
in
my
eyebrows
,
dust
my
cheeks
with
some
blush
and
bronzer
,
and
run
a
mascara
wand
through
my
eyelashes
.
I
call
it
putting
on
my
face
.
I
never
consider
leaving
my
dorm
without
wearing
any
makeup
.
I
have
struggled
to
reconcile
my
reliance
on
makeup
with
my
feminist
ideals
for
years
.
How
could
I
claim
opposition
to
patriarchal
beauty
norms
while
actively
perpetuating
them
?
But
in
actuality
,
feminists
make
that
job
pretty
easy
.
When
asked
why
they
wear
makeup
,
most
feminists
will
say
that
makeup
is
a
form
of
empowerment
.
And
for
many
women
,
this
is
true
makeup
is
merely
a
tool
to
enhance
both
their
physical
appearance
and
their
confidence
.
In
fact
,
putting
on
makeup
can
be
very
enjoyable
,
even
a
form
of
self
care
.
I
know
that
when
my
eyeliner
is
sharp
,
I
feel
like
I
can
take
on
the
world
.
The
problem
comes
when
your
made
up
face
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
.
I
no
longer
put
on
makeup
to
look
beautiful
I
put
on
makeup
to
look
normal
.
Because
so
few
people
have
seen
me
without
makeup
,
not
wearing
it
feels
like
choosing
to
show
the
world
an
inferior
Rebecca
.
My
bare
face
is
no
longer
me
,
but
rather
,
a
subpar
version
of
the
self
I’d
prefer
to
see
in
the
mirror
.
In
the
past
,
I
too
have
responded
to
questions
about
the
sexist
undertones
of
makeup
by
expressing
how
much
I
enjoy
it
.
I
assumed
that
,
because
makeup
is
feminist
for
some
,
it
was
also
feminist
for
me
.
But
that’s
not
the
whole
story
.
If
I
felt
adequate
without
makeup
on
,
I
surely
wouldn’t
wear
it
every
day
.
Nor
would
I
be
so
terrified
of
my
friends
catching
a
glimpse
of
my
imperfect
skin
.
By
asserting
makeup
as
a
feminist
activity
,
I
can
shamelessly
validate
the
choice
to
reinforce
my
insecurities
and
unconsciously
comply
with
patriarchal
norms
.
My
insecurities
are
only
intensified
by
the
media
,
which
is
a
constant
reminder
that
my
worth
is
determined
by
my
appearance
.
Particularly
,
that
I
am
only
valuable
to
men
if
I
am
pretty
.
There
was
a
joke
which
became
popular
a
few
years
ago
that
has
stuck
with
me
take
your
girl
swimming
on
the
first
date
.
You
know
,
so
her
makeup
washes
off
and
you
can
make
sure
she’s
not
actually
hideous
.
The
implication
here
is
that
that
being
unattractive
by
conventional
standards
strips
women
of
their
value
.
Even
the
women
we
consider
the
most
beautiful
aren’t
exempt
from
this
criticism
.
Female
celebrities
who
choose
not
to
wear
makeup
are
brave
at
best
and
secretly
ugly
at
worst
.
And
society
has
taught
us
that
,
as
women
,
being
ugly
is
one
of
the
worst
things
you
can
be
.
Is
it
any
wonder
that
we
will
avoid
those
judgments
at
all
costs
?
Even
if
it
means
wasting
our
time
,
money
and
energy
on
a
routine
that
we
lie
and
say
we
do
simply
because
we
want
to
?
The
claim
that
makeup
is
a
form
of
feminism
or
an
instrument
of
the
patriarchy
is
too
black
and
white
.
Such
a
statement
consciously
ignores
the
beauty
industry’s
power
over
the
female
reality
,
as
well
as
the
vicious
ideals
it
imposes
from
a
young
age
.
There
are
thousands
of
businesses
that
profit
from
the
insecurities
of
women
who
have
been
implicitly
convinced
that
they
will
be
worth
more
if
they
are
prettier
.
Our
faces
are
currency
,
and
the
more
we
are
envied
for
our
beauty
,
the
more
our
value
inflates
.
If
we
cannot
profit
from
our
natural
beauty
,
we
can
profit
from
the
substitute
layer
of
physical
beauty
that
makeup
provides
.
Makeup
is
surely
empowering
for
some
.
But
for
most
of
us
,
it’s
both
a
form
of
elevation
and
suppression
.
We
like
to
look
better
in
part
because
we
know
society
will
respond
more
positively
to
us
if
we
do
.
I
wish
the
moral
of
this
story
was
that
I
have
decided
to
stop
wearing
makeup
.
But
the
truth
is
,
I’m
still
too
scared
.
However
,
I’m
going
to
stop
claiming
that
my
use
of
makeup
is
not
a
problematic
choice
.
I
recognize
the
sexist
standards
being
lobbied
against
me
,
even
if
I
can’t
yet
dare
to
rebel
against
them
.

If
you
can
truly
say
that
you
wear
makeup
only
to
show
off
your
beauty
rather
than
to
hide
behind
it
,
more
power
to
you
.
But
I’d
bet
that
,
when
you
look
at
your
made
up
face
in
the
mirror
,
your
reaction
results
from
more
inherently
sexist
norms
than
you’d
like
to
admit
.
The
proposed
light
rail
would
have
a
stop
nbsp
;
along
Lasalle
Street
and
nbsp
;
Erwin
Road
near
Duke
Hospital
.
The
proposed
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
is
vitally
important
to
the
future
of
our
region
and
our
state
.
I
say
this
as
a
Person
County
farmer
and
a
downtown
Durham
property
owner
.
My
greatest
concern
is
the
long
term
viability
of
agriculture
and
farm
land
.
In
North
Carolina
there
are
an
estimated
49
,
500
nbsp
;
farms
covering
8
.
4
million
nbsp
;
acres
of
land
which
have
an
agricultural
economic
impact
of
76
billion
a
year
.
Durham
and
Orange
County
have
approximately
600
farms
;
the
Durham
Farmers’
Market
has
65
vendors
that
come
from
within
a
70
mile
area
.
Our
local
farms
produce
good
,
accessible
food
;
they
are
the
backbone
of
some
of
the
Piedmont’s
economies
and
communities
.
Further
,
they
provide
the
high
quality
of
life
and
beauty
that
North
Carolina’s
rural
and
natural
landscape
provide
.
As
a
farmer
I
am
committed
to
conserving
and
stewarding
my
family’s
farm
so
I
support
transit
alternatives
that
concentrate
development
and
curb
sprawl
.
I
also
recognize
that
choices
in
travel
for
all
citizens
are
needed
to
achieve
sustainable
and
equitable
communities
in
our
region
.
A
light
rail
system
that
is
safe
,
reliable
and
convenient
does
this
.
It
will
also
improve
air
quality
,
reduce
traffic
congestion
,
and
save
billions
of
BTUs
of
energy
every
year
it
operates
.
I
can
think
of
no
infrastructure
project
worthier
of
significant
public
investment
.
I
call
on
the
leadership
,
public
and
private
,
to
do
what
is
necessary
to
make
this
project
a
reality
.
It
has
been
a
long
time
coming
.

Welcome
to
this
year's
Chron15
.
Looking
back
at
your
Duke
experience
so
far
,
who
were
the
people
that
impacted
you
the
most
?
As
students
,
we
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
at
this
University
.
This
annual
list
aims
to
highlight
a
few
of
the
people
who
have
impacted
that
.
People
who
broke
records
,
who
advocated
for
the
rights
of
marginalized
groups
,
who
made
you
smile
at
the
JB’s
checkout
line
.
Every
year
,
Chron15
honors
campus
pioneers
,
leaders
and
icons
.
Our
selections
are
based
on
nominations
from
the
Duke
community
,
and
they
attempt
to
highlight
the
individuals
or
groups
who
have
shaped
experiences
at
the
University
.
We
believe
that
the
people
honored
in
the
Chron15
exemplify
the
Duke
community
in
2019
and
what
it
means
to
be
a
part
of
it
.
Our
honorees
this
year
have
overcome
unimaginable
hardships
and
fought
for
their
beliefs
.
They
are
people
who
foster
community
and
brighten
up
your
day
.
They
are
people
with
incredible
athletic
talents
and
charisma
,
or
intellectual
pioneers
as
faculty
in
various
fields
.
As
you
read
about
the
Chron15
,
we
want
you
to
consider
their
significance
and
contributions
to
the
community
and
experience
at
Duke
or
their
impact
in
broader
areas
,
like
their
scholarly
field
.
Whether
it
is
your
first
or
last
year
on
campus
,
we
hope
you
will
reflect
on
the
people
who
have
impacted
you
,
the
people
you
have
impacted
and
your
experience
as
a
part
of
this
community
.
These
are
not
the
only
15
influential
people
on
campus
,
of
course
.
Instead
,
they
represent
a
cross
section
of
different
pieces
of
student
life
,
each
of
which
includes
many
more
mentors
and
leaders
.
This
collection
aims
to
highlight
the
stories
of
15
people
and
groups
who
impact
this
University
.
But
at
a
school
as
big
as
Duke
,
this
barely
scratches
the
surface
.
So
we
urge
you
to
look
around
yourself
and
listen
to
others’
stories
.
This
University
is
a
special
place
.
Take
advantage
of
it
while
you
can
.

were
inspired
by
his
commitment
to
doing
what
is
right
,
shown
through
his
conviction
while
pressing
the
President
,
alongside
other
students
,
for
full
student
healthcare
coverage
or
introducing
campus
accessibility
guidelines
.
When
the
Board
of
Trustees
wanted
to
increase
tuition
,
he
was
the
first
member
to
vote
against
the
motion
.
Luke
sets
a
remarkable
example
of
how
best
to
act
if
the
Standard
is
compromised
,
both
in
academia
and
in
social
settings
.
Through
his
engagement
with
Common
Ground
and
other
campus
organizations
,
he
has
worked
to
change
campus
culture
,
targeting
toxic
masculinity
and
socioeconomic
inequality
on
campus
.
Studying
math
,
computer
science
,
and
neuroscience
,
Luke
has
experience
serving
as
SOFC
chair
and
advising
President
Price
on
investment
responsibility
.
He
also
emphasized
that
his
presence
on
the
board
would
provide
increased
advocacy
for
ethics
in
STEM
.
Luke
is
an
enthusiastic
and
effective
communicator
.
Honor
Council
is
confident
that
he
will
demonstrate
moral
courage
to
make
positive
change
at
Duke
as
Young
Trustee
.
Honor
Council
also
recognizes
the
high
moral
standards
that
all
candidates
bring
.
Honor
Council
supports
Brian
Buhr’s
moral
conviction
and
speaking
truth
to
power
through
the

,
Trey
Walk’s
enthusiastic
commitment
to
elevating
community
voices
and
maintaining
accountability
,
and
Archana
Ahlawat’s
dedication
to
empathy
,
integrity
and
empowering
women’s
voices
in

.
The
Trustees
convened
at
the
Washington
Duke
nbsp
;
Inn
and
Golf
Club
to
discuss
a
myriad
of
issues
,
including
undergraduate
tuition
and
Duke's
affordability
.
This
past
Wednesday
the
Duke
undergraduate
community
elected
Trey
Walk
to
be
the
next
Young
Trustee
.
When
the
Chronicle
released
election
results
,
I
couldn’t
help
but
be
happy
for
my
friend
,
Trey
.
I
have
seen
the
hard
work
that
he
has
put
into
making
Duke
a
more
aware
and
accepting
campus
and
feel
like
he
will
bring
a
refreshing
voice
to
Duke’s
Board
of
Trustees
.
Despite
my
happiness
for
Trey
,
Wednesday
afternoon
brought
an
overwhelming
feeling
of
disappointment
.
I
was
not
on
Trey’s
campaign
team
.
I
was
on
Luke
Farrell
’s
team
.
The
decision
that
we
got
was
nowhere
near
the
decision
that
we
wanted
.
Yet
,
at
no
point
during
the
campaign
did
I
lose
faith
in
Luke
or
regret
taking
on
the
role
of
a
campaign
manager
.
Even
after
the
air
was
knocked
out
of
my
lungs
,
I
considered
the
three
weeks
I
spent
with
Luke
and
our
team
a
victory
.
Why’s
that
?
It’s
because
this
campaign
opened
my
eyes
to
a
side
of
Duke
and
a
side
of
myself
that
I
rarely
see
.
For
three
weeks
I
was
devoted
to
a
cause
that
I
believed
would
benefit
Duke
in
the
long
run
.
Out
of
that
came
three
important
realizations
Reaching
out
to
every
student
group
on
campus
Luke’s
goal
for
outreach
proved
to
be
a
pretty
difficult
task
.
Emailing
presidents
,
treasurers
,
and
point
people
was
the
least
satisfying
part
of
my
job
.
Receiving
responses
from
groups
that
were
willing
to
meet
was
gratifying
up
until
the
scheduling
of
campaign
meetings
began
.
Running
from
meeting
to
meeting
on
what
our
team
dubbed
Super
Sunday
and
managing
to
fit
22
student
groups
in
a
12
hour
block
of
time
was
nothing
short
of
exhausting
.
In
my
sprints
from
WU
248
to
Old
Chem
or
the
trek
from
Languages
to
BioSci
,
however
,
I
realized
that
the
communities
that
I
often
cast
off
as
not
being
places
for
me
are
much
more
than
the
sum
of
their
stereotypical
parts
.
For
better
or
for
worse
,
my
social
Duke
experience
has
been
about
finding
places
where
I
think
I
fit
in
.
In
this
scramble
for
acceptance
,
I
have
had
to
make
calculated
decisions
based
on
presuppositions
.
I
supposed
that
,
because
majority
white
Greek
organizations
historically
have
not
been
welcoming
to
black
men
,
I
was
not
welcome
in
those
spaces
.
I
supposed
that
because
my
interactions
with
other
black
men
at
home
have
been
lackluster
,
that
I
would
not
feel
comfortable
entering
a
Black
Men’s
Union
meeting
.
I
supposed
that
I
would
not
know
how
to
receive
,
process
,
and
empathize
with
the
concerns
of
Jewish
Student
Union
because
I
had
not
made
my
first
Jewish
friend
until
coming
to
Duke
.
I
could
not
have
been
more
wrong
about
assuming
my
place
on
campus
.
In
each
of
my
interactions
with
groups
that
I
self
determined
were
not
places
for
me
,
I
found
nothing
but
welcoming
students
.
I
found
that
people
were
willing
to
have
a
conversation
about
how
to
make
this
campus
work
better
for
all
of
us
.
What
I
learned
on
the
campaign
trail
was
to
never
discount
the
potential
relationships
I
could
have
with
an
individual
or
a
group
based
on
superficial
characteristics
or
overshadowing
stereotypes
.
Along
those
same
lines
,
Duke
students
have
a
lot
to
offer
one
another
.
When
Luke
reached
out
to
me
about
joining
his
campaign
,
I
immediately
agreed
.
Luke
is
a
friend
of
mine
now
a
close
friend
thanks
to
the
countless
hours
we’ve
spent
together
in
a
shared
state
of
sleep
deprivation
.
I
agreed
because
he
was
and
still
is
someone
I
trust
to
lead
his
community
in
the
right
direction
.
But
,
to
some
degree
,
I
agreed
in
blind
faith
.
I
had
no
idea
what
this
election
would
demand
of
me
.
Pretty
early
on
I
realized
that
the
demand
would
be
softened
by
the
amazing
team
of
people
working
alongside
Luke
and
myself
.
Over
the
course
of
the
campaign
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
amazing
Duke
students
,
each
with
their
own
polished
set
of
skills
,
who
would
teach
me
the
importance
of
building
a
real
connection
with
your
network
.
I
remember
walking
into
the
first
team
meeting
and
being
overwhelmed
by
the
star
power
in
the
room
.
It
was
almost
as
if
Luke
recruited
team
members
from
the
list
of
people
I
admire
the
most
at
Duke
.
It
would
have
been
very
easy
to
use
this
opportunity
to
network
with
a
Rhodes
scholar
,
a
Gender
Violence
leader
,
a
social
media
content
creator
,
and
the
most
experience
student
campaign
manager
on
campus
.
Thankfully
,
the
sheer
amount
of
time
we
spent
together
wouldn’t
allow
for
that
level
of
superficiality
.
In
the
three
weeks
leading
up
to
the
election
,
I
formed
genuine
friendships
with
some
of
the
people
I
admire
the
most
on
campus
.
Dealing
with
profile
picture
rollouts
,
a
24
hour
deadline
for
a
campaign
video
,
and
jokes
about
only
having
one
collective
brain
cell
really
brings
people
together
.
We
all
walked
into
the
first
core
team
meeting
as
individuals
with
a
lot
of
experience
to
bring
to
the
campaign
.
We
hung
our
hats
once
the
decision
was
released
as
a
group
of
friends
willing
to
do
it
all
again
.

I
wouldn’t
trade
the
time
I
spent
holed
up
in
war
rooms
creating
memos
and
prepping
Luke
for
meetings
for
anything
.
The
campaign
took
a
lot
out
of
me
.
I
lost
sleep
,
I
lost
out
on
my
social
life
,
I
even
lost
out
on
a
few
grade
points
in
more
than
one
class
.
All
of
it
was
worth
it
,
however
,
because
this
campaign
made
me
realize
that
the
people
on
the
team
are
the
people
I
need
to
be
around
to
succeed
.
I
realize
,
more
importantly
,
gritty
campaign
work
is
what
I
want
to
do
post
Duke
.
In
the
spirit
of
former
DNC
spokesman
,
Mo
Elleithee
,
it
was
important
for
me
to
do
it
and
just
go
on
this
journey
with
Luke
.
It
taught
me
more
about
Duke
,
my
peers
,
and
myself
than
anything
has
in
my
time
here
.
That’s
why
I
count
this
campaign
as
a
victory
.
Independent
from
the
outcome
,
who
I
met
and
what
I
learned
along
the
way
has
set
me
up
for
a
promising
next
two
years
at
Duke
.
All
thanks
to
one
phone
call
from
Luke
Farrell
.
Last
week
the
Board
of
Trustees
approved
a
3
.
9
percent
increase
in
the
cost
of
undergraduate
tuition
for
the
2019
2020
academic
year
,
which
will
now
be
55
,
380
.
The
total
official
cost
of
attendance
including
tuition
,
room
,
board
and
fees
will
now
be
73
,
519
,
up
from
70
,
873
.
While
the
3
.
7
percent
increase
was
the
lowest
rate
of
total
cost
increase
in
about
20
years
as
reflected
President
Vincent
Price’s
statement
that
the
adjustment
reflected
concerns
about
balancing
the
costs
of
providing
our
educational
experience
student
responses
,
as
expected
,
have
been
less
than
favorable
.
As
always
,
dissatisfied
upper
middle
class
Duke
students
went
onto
social
media
to
voice
their
concerns
about
the
3
.
9
percent
tuition
hike
.
Over
the
past
few
years
,
the
Editorial
Board
has
interviewed
former
President
Richard
Brodhead
and
President
Price
on
a
spectrum
of
campus
issues
,
including
financial
aid
.
Brodhead
noted
that
the
real
cost
of
attending
Duke
has
actually
declined
for
students
on
financial
aid
over
the
past
few
decades
,
which
has
been
partially
subsidized
by
such
annual
increases
.
Price’s
response
echoed
Brodhead's
explanation
,
citing
a
larger
issue
of
competing
with
peer
schools
to
expand
services
and
programs
,
in
addition
to
providing
need
based
aid
.
Price
also
mentioned
that
the
increase
in
financial
aid
spending
depends
mainly
on
unaided
tuition
dollars
rather
than
the
endowment
,
though
he
acknowledged
uncertainty
over
the
sustainability
of
the
current
tuition
model
in
place
.
The
fact
that
current
and
past
administrators
are
unsure
of
Duke’s
ability
to
manage
an
increase
in
both
financial
aid
and
tuition
should
merit
concern
.
Spending
on
higher
education
has
remained
well
below
historical
levels
despite
recent
increases
in
spending
,
as
state
funding
for
public
two
and
four
year
colleges
in
2017
of
9
billion
fell
below
its
2008
level
,
after
adjusting
for
inflation
.
Earlier
this
month
,
the
White
House
released
its
2019
fiscal
year
budget
request
for
an
a
10
.
5
percent
budget
cut
,
which
creates
a
loss
of
over
7
billion
from
education
spending
across
PreK
12
and
higher
education
.
Even
considering
the
amended
budget
requests
,
in
which
many
of
the
higher
education
specific
reductions
would
be
restored
,
questions
about
the
viability
of
Pell
grants
remain
.
Though
Duke
functions
as
a
private
university
,
and
is
largely
unaffected
by
state
spending
cuts
,
alterations
to
government
subsidized
aid
have
ramifications
for
much
of
the
student
body
.
The
increase
in
tuition
merits
concern
in
part
because
students
are
sometimes
unaware
of
where
the
money
is
being
spent
.
In
a
2014
NPR
article
,
reporters
discussed
a
claim
by
Jim
Roberts
,
former
executive
vice
provost
for
finance
and
administration
,
that
we're
investing
on
average
about
90
,
000
in
the
education
of
each
student
.
Michael
Schoenfeld
,
vice
president
for
public
affairs
and
government
relations
,
was
also
cited
in
article
,
stating
that
most
answers
to
Duke’s
spending
per
student
could
be
searched
online
.
Given
that
this
supposed
investment
for
each
student
now
is
likely
nearer
to
100
,
000
,
perhaps
Duke
should
make
these
seemingly
arbitrary
figures
more
transparent
in
the
hopes
of
alleviating
worries
for
Duke’s
upper
middle
class
students
.
Duke
University
maintains
a
relatively
small
endowment
of
8
.
5
billion
,
which
is
dwarfed
by
those
of
Stanford
and
Harvard
,
which
stand
at
24
.
8
and
39
.
2
,
respectively
.
Despite
recent
drives
to
expand
and
drive
development
,
Duke
still
draws
a
shorter
purse
from
which
to
manage
rising
costs
.
That
being
said
,
Rice
University
,
with
an
endowment
of
6
.
2
billion
offers
U
.
S
.
undergraduates
with
family
incomes
under
130
,
000
tuition
free
scholarships
.
Moreover
,
Vanderbilt
,
with
an
endowment
only
about
half
that
of
Duke
,
provides
loan
free
aid
to
undergraduates
.
Though
Rice
is
currently
managing
a
125
million
fundraising
campaign
to
fund
its
ambitious
efforts
at
improving
affordability
,
it
seems
somewhat
questionable
that
Duke
has
yet
to
announce
its
own
drastic
expansion
of
financial
aid
in
the
near
future
despite
possessing
an
endowment
greater
than
our
Southern
peers
.
The
Board
of
Trustees’
decision
will
impact
sectors
of
the
student
body
differently
depending
on
socioeconomic
class
.
For
Duke’s
upper
middle
class
students
possessing
annual
household
incomes
of
around
150
,
000
250
,
000
,
likely
making
them
ineligible
for
aid
this
increase
will
most
likely
mean
more
belt
tightening
as
their
families
struggle
with
the
73
,
519
price
tag
.
However
,
increases
in
tuition
at
the
expense
of
certain
students
,
in
this
case
the
Duke
middle
class
,
need
not
be
a
zero
sum
game
;
improving
aid
for
some
students
does
not
have
to
lead
to
a
reduction
of
that
of
other
students
.
We
also
urge
students
to
stay
committed
to
collective
action
,
as
Price
noted
that
the
lower
increase
in
tuition
compared
to
previous
years
was
partially
the
result
of
student
concerns
.
The
annual
increases
in
tuition
are
unlikely
to
end
in
the
foreseeable
future
;
as
an
institution
,
nonetheless
,
we
should
still
be
concerned
with
mitigating
and
adapting
to
these
increases
as
we
approach
an
age
where
Duke
may
cost
approximately
80
,
000
for
the
un
aided
.
I
am
tired
of
reading
about
being
low
income
at
Duke
.
Weekly
,
I
am
confronted
with
the
anomaly
of
my
low
income
status
on
Duke’s
campus
in
the
form
of
emails
and
truly
well
intentioned
events
.
Brunch

Low

Conversation
on

Management
at
Duke
!
Daily
,
I
am
confronted
with
my
low
income
status
in
a
more
personal
way
,
as
I
look
at
the
brands
of
jackets
,
bags
,
and
surprisingly
even
day
planners
around
me
.
Yes
,
feeling
uncomfortable
,
out
of
place
,
and
insecure
transcends
carrying
the
heavy
weight
of
financial
insecurity
on
your
back
.
It
can
be
superficial
.
It’s
just
as
often
,
and
valid
,
that
I
feel
these
insecurities
when
deciding
whether
to
buy
Juul
pods
as
I
do
walking
into
my
third
job
.
Just
because
the
burden
of
being
poor
at
Duke
manifests
itself
in
different
forms
does
not
make
the
discomfort
any
less
rational
feelings
of
social
acceptance
and
community
factor
into
our
sense
of
security
.
However
,
I
will
not
validate
the
feeling
of
being
low
income
that
has
settled
upon
some
non
low
income
students
.
Middle
class
and
high
socioeconomic
status
SES
students
might
find
themselves
feeling
class
anxieties
previously
unknown
to
them
on
a
campus
with
a
disproportionate
number
of
1
percenters
,
but
that
does
not
give
them
the
authority
to
speak
for
me
,
or
other
actual
low
SES
students
at
Duke
.
Moreover
,
I
do
not
have
the
authority
to
speak
for
fellow
low
income
students
,
as
each
situation
is
unique
in
its
difficulties
.
So
instead
,
I
will
pivot
this
column
to
address
high
income
students
.
Since
it
seems
that
everyone
and
their
aunt
has
advice
for
how
low
income
students
should
spend
their
time
and
money
,
it
is
only
fitting
the
real
minority
at
least
in
terms

How
to
be
High
Income
at
Duke
and
Not
The
Worst
Person
I
am
the
product
of
several
situations
beyond
my
control
.
I’ve
always
lived
below
the
poverty
line
,
and
in
the
years
preceding
Duke
those
issues
were
exacerbated
by
the
maladies
of
cancer
,
death
in
the
family
,
and
more
recently
the
loss
of
our
family
business
and
sole
source
of
income
from
Hurricane
Florence
.
But
beyond
this
,
I
am
very
privileged
.
I
am
a
white
,
cisgender
woman
attending
one
of
the
top
universities
in
the
country
.
I
have
the
privilege
to
hide
,
or
at
least
disguise
,
this
part
of
my
identity
in
times
that
I
feel
threatened
or
unwelcome
.
This
is
not
the
case
for
other
ostracized
identities
on
campus
,
so
I’d
urge
those
from
a
place
of
privilege
to
work
on
changing
your
environment
around
you
.
The
pressure
to
conform
should
not
fall
upon
the
shoulders
of
persons
already
bearing
the
weight
of
oppression
,
but
rather
should
be
renegotiated
by
persons
with
the
mobility
to
do
so
.
I
hope
this
is
the
last
financial
column
we
see
in
a
while
,
as
the
conversation
moves
from
public
spaces
into
more
intimate
settings
,
as
you
discuss
with
your
friends
and
most
importantly
yourself
what
you
can
do
to
be
better
,
or
,
if
anything
,
what
you
can
do
to
not
be
the
worst
.
Krzyzewskiville
is
at
full
capacity
for
tenting
with
the
North
Carolina
game
just
eight
days
away
.
Tenting
has
been
a
phenomenon
on
Duke’s
campus
for
over
30
years
.
Beginning
in
1986
with
a
group
of
friends
who
just
wanted
one
of
the
best
spots
for
the
Duke
vs
.
UNC
game
,
the
practice
of
tenting
exploded
into
the
intricate
and
complex
system
of
checks
and
balances
that
we
know
today
.
The
tenting
groups
are
heavily
regulated
and
monitored
by
the
line
monitors
to
ensure
that
everyone
is
following
the
tenting
rules
accordingly
.
As
many
know
,
there
are
varying
levels
of
tenting
the
black
level
,
the
blue
level
,
and
the
white
level
.
A
couple
of
weeks
ago
,
the
line
monitors
rolled
out
a
new
approach
to
determining
who
was
eligible
to
white
tent
and
in
replacement
of
the
walk
up
line
flex
tent
.
As
for
any
other
complex
methodology
,
it
is
important
to
analyze
the
procedure
put
into
place
to
evaluate
its
systematic
integrity
.
Essentially
,
we
must
ask
,
Did
the
methodology
put
forth
by
the
line
monitor
committee
demonstrate
both
honor
and
integrity
?
In
a
normal
scavenger
hunt
style
,
the
race
to
earn
a
spot
as
a
white
tent
consisted
of
finding
various
locations
via
cryptic
clues
.
The
logic
behind
developing
a
line
was
the
same
those
groups
to
find
the
locations
first
would
be
placed
higher
on
the
list
than
the
others
;
the
first
thirty
groups
to
find
the
spots
would
earn
spots
as
white
tents
,
and
the
remaining
thirty
tents
would
earn
spots
as
flex
tents
.
Instead
of
just
doing
one
spot
as
they
have
done
in
years
past
,
the
line
monitors
chose
to
have
different
locations
.
This
meant
groups
had
to
spread
out
across
campus
and
have
different
members
check
in
at
each
location
.
Immediately
,
it
sounds
like
a
complex
methodology
.
During
a
recent
talk
regarding
scientific
integrity
,
Geeta
Swammy
,
vice
dean
and
associate
vice
provost
of
scientific
integrity
,
discussed
the
importance
of
upholding
integrity
throughout
a
research
or
field
procedure
.
As
with
any
procedure
seen
within
the
research
setting
,
certain
protocols
are
required
to
ensure
maximum
safety
and
reproducibility
and
to
minimize
the
amount
of
potential
errors
.
This
scavenger
hunt
did
not
seem
to
meet
these
criteria
,
and
therefore
seemed
to
be
less
thoroughly
developed
.
In
consequence
,
confusion
and
disorder
ensued
throughout
the
hunt
.
Because
there
were
multiple
locations
that
group
members
were
required
to
check
in
to
,
the
line
monitors
had
to
factor
in
the
order
of
each
group
at
each
location
in
their
final
time
score
.
This
differs
greatly
than
having
just
one
location
in
which
the
line
formed
would
translate
directly
into
the
list
of
groups
earning
a
spot
to
white
tent
.
The
increased
complexity
would
require
a
way
in
which
the
time
each
individual
group
member
arrived
at
each
station
was
factored
in
some
cumulative
time
or
score
,
in
order
to
rank
all
of
the
groups
.
From
there
,
the
line
monitors
could
determine
the
list
.
Once
the
scavenger
hunt
was
underway
,
the
line
monitors
failed
to
take
into
account
the
long
queues
that
developed
due
to
poor
staffing
at
each
station
.
Furthermore
,
the
way
in
which
the
line
monitors
dealt
with
the
situation
was
faulty
stations
had
line
monitors
write
numbers
on
the
group
member’s
hand
to
keep
the
line
in
order
.
This
did
not
take
into
account
the
actual
time
at
which
the
groups
were
able
to
locate
the
spot
.
This
meant
the
time
of
certain
groups
at
certain
stations
were
inherently
skewed
due
to
lack
of
oversight
.
It
became
obvious
that
this
was
clearly
going
to
affect
how
the
order
of
the
lines
were
determined
,
requiring
an
even
more
intricate
calculation
in
order
to
generate
the
list
as
accurately
as
possible
.
Bottom
line
it
seemed
as
if
the
methodology
was
not
thoroughly
analyzed
,
checked
and
tried
like
any
other
procedure
should
be
prior
to
its
implementation
.
It
is
valid
to
see
this
application
of
scientific
integrity
on
the
white
tenting
scavenger
hunt
as
a
stretch
;
they
are
two
very
different
fields
that
would
produce
very
different
consequences
if
the
methodology
were
never
double
checked
.
However
,
tenting
is
an
integral
part
of
student
life
here
at
Duke
.
The
UNC
vs
.
Duke
basketball
game
is
one
of
the
biggest
events
that
occurs
on
campus
in
the
spring
.
The
rivalry
runs
deep
,
and
proud
Duke
students
want
to
cheer
their
team
to
victory
.
With
Cameron
being
as
small
as
it
is
,
there
has
to
be
a
way
in
which
students
are
admitted
into
the
game
,
placing
a
lot
of
weight
on
the
integrity
of
tenting
as
a
system
.
Clearly
,
tenting
is
a
constantly
growing
and
increasingly
complex
system
.
If
Duke
wants
this
system
to
flourish
fully
in
light
of
its
increasing
growth
,
figures
of
authority
must
find
ways
to
perfect
its
methodology
to
ensure
the
system
is
one
of
honor
and
integrity
.
Each
part
of
the
tenting
process
should
be
evaluated
critically
and
meticulously
in
order
to
produce
a
system
that
match
its
growing
popularity
and
intricacy
.
The
scavenger
hunt
is
just
a
single
outside
the
classroom
example
where
integrity
is
most
important
.
Honor
Council
strives
to
promote
a
community
of
honor
on
Duke’s
campus
and
the
world
of
tenting
falls
in
our
domain
.
We
encourage
students
and
line
monitors
alike
to
keep
the
Duke
Community
Standard
in
mind
each
year
during
the
tenting
season
to
ensure
we
uphold
our
community’s
values
.
The
Muse
chooses
to
endorse
Archana
Ahlawat
because
we
believe
she
will
be
the
strongest
advocate
for
women
during
her
term
on
the
Board
of
Trustees
.
We
believe
her
commitment
to
women’s
representation
in
all
spaces
will
make
Duke’s
campus
a
safer
and
more
equitable
place
for
all
women
who
attend
Duke
.
We
believe
that
women’s
voices
matter
and
should
be
an
important
part
of
the
stewardship
of
this
university
.
Archana
will
be
the
best
representative
of
the
values
this
organization
holds
dear
equality
,
opportunity
and
diversity
.
We
have
come
to
this
endorsement
after
having
spoken
with
all
four
candidates
.
The
Muse
is
a
feminist
publication
at
Duke
University
founded
by
two
students
who
desired
to
create
a
positive
outlet
for
women’s
empowerment
on
Duke’s
campus
.
Drawn
out
of
the
findings
of
former
President
Nannerl
Keohane’s
Women’s
Initiative
report
,
which
found
a
trend
of
decreased
confidence
through
Duke
women's
undergraduate
careers
,
the
publication
seeks
to
facilitate
the
contrary
.
We
value
quality
and
community
over
selectivity
and
quantity
.
We
believe
that
all
women
on
campus
have
a
right
to
feel
welcomed
and
empowered
.
As
an
intersectional
feminist
magazine
,
The
Muse
believe
that
Archana
will
be
the
best
advocate
for
these
values
we
strive
to
promote
on
campus
.
Maybe
the
taboo
is
finally
broken
.
Not
only
do
students
with
low
socioeconomic
status
SES
exist
on
campus
,
but
we
have
a
voice
,
too
.
I
have
spent
much
of
my
Duke
experience
coming
to
terms
with
my
status
as
a
low
SES
student
.
Duke’s
campus
serves
a
constant
reminder
of
wealth
and
lack
thereof
from
the
95
million
restoration
of
West
Union
over
my
first
year
to
the
annual
four
percent
increase
in
tuition
to
the
8
.
5
billion
endowment
that
Duke
proudly
displays
at
any
and
all
opportunities
.
Due
to
the
juxtaposition
between
Duke’s
commitment
to
parading
its
expansive
wealth
in
front
of
the
world
and
my
financial
background
,
I
often
feel
isolated
living
in
this
type
of
environment
.
However
,
it
is
not
just
the
institution
itself
that
creates
these
feelings
of
solitude
.
In
fact
,
I
find
that
I
normally
experience
the
largest
insecurities
surrounding
my
financial
status
when
spending
time
with
peers
.
Let’s
face
it
49
percent
of
Duke
students
are
able
to
pay
the
full
,
ever
increasing
price
of
attending
this
university
.
The
median
household
income
of
Duke
students
sits
at
around
186
,
700
.
About
20
percent
of
Duke
students
have
families
who
make
over
630
,
000
.
Over
70
percent
of
Duke
students
have
families
who
make
over
100
,
000
.
And
then
there’s
me
,
and
my
family’s
annual
income
,
which
places
me
in
a
bracket
with
approximately
the
bottom
four
percent
of
Duke
students
.
The
vacations
I
cannot
take
,
the
meals
I
cannot
eat
off
campus
,
the
books
professors
require
without
a
second
thought
,
the
extra
work
shifts
I
need
to
pick
up
because
I
am
always
thinking
about
what
I
will
need
to
purchase
next
.
The
awkward
dinners
where
friends
boast
about
their
extravagant
travel
,
the
burden
of
knowing
that
laundry
cannot
be
covered
by
my
generous
financial
aid
donors
,
the
extensive
research
and
application
processes
to
apply
for
summer
grants
to
be
afforded
the
same
opportunities
as
many
other
,
wealthier
students
on
this
campus
.
The
uncomfortable
conversations
where
food
points
are
not
considered
real
money
even
though
I
depend
on
them
to
eat
,
the
brushing
off
of
comments
that
I
am
so
lucky
to
be
on
full
financial
aid
without
confronting
what
it
actually
means
,
the
quiet
shrug
when
people
question
why
I
work
so
many
jobs
.
These
are
the
realities
of
a
low
SES
Duke
student
.
Not
just
on
the
weekends
,
or
in
one
class
,
or
in
one
social
organization
,
but
every
day
at
a
university
that
mutes
dialogue
which
actively
challenges
the
perception
of
low
SES
students
.
Many
of
us
share
these
experiences
of
embarrassment
,
shame
and
discomfort
.
Of
stress
,
anxiety
and
uncertainty
.
So
,
we
should
not
tear
each
other
down
when
we
all
struggle
with
certain
aspects
of
being
a
low
SES
student
.
We
should
not
assert
our
financial
burden
over
burdens
that
impact
other
students
.
Instead
,
we
should
validate
our
peers’
personal
challenges
of
existing
on
a
campus
where
low
SES
identities
are
often
neglected
.
We
should
say
yes
,
and
to
validate
that
low
SES
status
impacts
you
and
me
in
similar
and
different
ways
.
We
should
stand
together
to
amplify
our
voices
to
bring
a
greater
understanding
to
students
who
cannot
empathize
with
the
struggles
of
being
a
low
SES
student
at
Duke
.
I
will
admit
it
I
am
guilty
.
I
am
guilty
of
hearing
a
prestigious
private
high
school
that
my
peers
attended
and
rolling
my
eyes
without
a
second
thought
.
Of
stereotyping
certain
groups
of
people
based
on
their
perceived
wealth
.
Of
assuming
the
worst
intentions
of
those
I
know
who
come
from
an
extremely
wealthy
background
.
I
am
actively
working
to
change
these
reactions
,
although
it
is
not
easy
,
because
I
know
it
is
not
fair
to
judge
my
peers
based
on
their
income
bracket
.
On
the
other
end
,
however
,
I
am
not
guilty
of
poor
budgeting
.
Or
prioritizing
my
social
life
over
the
legitimate
financial
burdens
I
face
as
a
low
SES
student
.
Or
spending
irresponsibly
.
Or
invalidating
the
struggles
of
other
low
SES
students
on
this
campus
.
And
I
do
not
deserve
to
be
judged
or
invalidated
based
on
my
income
bracket
,
either
.
It
has
taken
me
four
years
to
come
to
terms
with
this
part
of
my
identity
on
campus
and
find
my
voice
;
to
confront
my
struggles
and
incorporate
these
lived
experiences
into
who
I
am
.
I
am
proud
of
the
low
SES
community
which
has
started
to
raise
its
voice
,
and
I
can
only
hope
that
this
dialogue
persists
and
develops
so
that
we
normalize
and
validate
our
peers
regardless
of
their
financial
background
coming
into
Duke
.
In
our
last
column
,
we
wrote
about
four
uncontroversial
ideas
which
constitute
key
principles
of
the
nascent
Effective
Altruism
EA
movement
,
of
which
Effective
Altruism
Duke
is
a
small
part
.
They
were
that
it’s
important
to
help
others
;
that
people
are
equal
;
that
helping
more
is
better
than
helping
less
;
and
that
we
have
limited
resources
.
But
they’re
not
the
full
story
.
EA
is
about
these
foundational
ideas
,
but
it’s
also
about
their
sometimes
surprising
implications
.
People
often
don’t
notice
the
consequences
of
their
basic
values
,
because
we
tend
to
have
values
at
many
levels
of
abstraction
.
For
instance
,
I
may
care
about
the
cohesion
and
flourishing
of
societies
and
cultures
as
a
whole
,
but
also
care
about
the
quality
individual
experience
from
moment
to
moment
,
and
intermediates
at
many
levels
of
abstraction
between
these
.
We
won’t
have
to
link
far
apart
levels
of
values
here
,
but
we’ll
try
to
hint
at
how
the
four
foundational
ideas
are
less
trivial
than
they
may
seem
at
first
glance
.
Almost
all
aspiring
EAs
agree
about
one
thing
choosing
your
ethics
is
not
easy
,
but
it
really
matters
.
There
are
trade
offs
everywhere
.
So
let’s
go
through
the
ideas
from
last
column
,
and
see
what
their
implications
are
from
the
EA
perspective
.
Some
of
these
claims
will
be
slightly
simplified
,
but
you’ll
get
the
idea
.
First
,
EAs
don’t
just
think
it’s
important
to
help
others
,
but
that
most
of
us
don’t
help
others
enough
.
The
average
early
career
salary
for
a
Duke
alum
may
be
71
,
200
.
Most
people
are
familiar
with
work
by
Daniel
Kahneman
and
Angus
Deaton
suggesting
that
salary
stops
correlating
with
reported
emotional
wellbeing
above
75
,
000
.
The
story
is
more
complicated
than
this
,
because
the
paper
also
noted
a
more
durable
correlation
between
income
and
another
component
of
subjective
well
being
,
namely
reported
life
satisfaction
.
It’s
a
complicated
picture
.
If
you
think
this
might
be
reason
to
reject
our
point
,
drop
us
a
line
.
By
mid
career
,
the
average
Duke
alum
earns
142
,
800
.
Our
argument
is
that
people
should
give
some
of
this
away
,
more
than
they
do
on
average
.
A
common
undertaking
by
members
of
the
EA
community
is
the
Giving
What
We
Can
Pledge
,
a
commitment
of
at
least
10
percent
of
one’s
lifetime
earnings
to
effective
charities
.
Don’t
misunderstand
us
this
is
not
appropriate
for
everyone
.
Some
of
us
have
dependents
,
some
of
us
have
burdensome
debt
,
some
of
us
have
health
issues
,
some
of
us
have
other
personal
challenges
to
overcome
.
Disparate
circumstances
confer
divergent
obligations
.
But
you
get
the
idea
.
Second
,
EAs
don’t
just
think
that
people
are
equal
,
but
that
we
privilege
those
spatially
and
socially
near
to
us
more
often
than
we
should
.
We
often
help
people
far
away
less
because
their
suffering
is
less
salient
.
It
doesn’t
walk
up
to
us
on
the
street
,
or
present
itself
at
family
gatherings
.
It’s
far
away
,
in
places
we
don’t
have
to
visit
.
We
don’t
think
that’s
a
good
reason
to
neglect
such
people
.
If
we
decide
we
would
rather
make
a
donation
at
home
,
we
should
be
explicit
about
our
reasons
for
doing
so
,
and
remember
that
suffering
there
is
the
same
as
suffering
here
.
Third
,
EAs
don’t
just
believe
that
helping
more
is
better
than
helping
less
,
but
that
maximizing
is
better
than
satisficing
.
In
other
words
,
we
don’t
think
there
is
a
threshold
after
which
we
don’t
have
to
help
anymore
.
If
we
have
yet
more
financial
means
,
time
,
energy
,
or
other
resources
,
there’s
always
a
chance
that
we
should
be
thinking
about
others
.
EA
is
not
about
self
sacrifice
,
but
it
is
about
sacrificing
what
doesn’t
nbsp
;
matter
,
while
preserving
and
taking
care
of
what
does
.
However
,
many
more
things
are
luxuries
than
we
realize
.
That’s
why
those
of
us
who
can
do
more
,
should
take
care
to
notice
,
and
do
more
.
We
aspire
to
never
turn
our
ethics
off
.
Finally
,
EAs
don’t
just
believe
that
we
have
limited
resources
,
but
that
we
should
understand
the
ethical
trade
offs
we
face
much
better
than
we
do
.
The
fact
is
that
money
goes
further
in
many
places
than
it
does
in
the
United
States
.
Some
people
don’t
like
the
idea
of
putting
a
price
on
lives
;
we
don’t
like
it
either
.
We
try
to
remember
that
the
cost
of
saving
a
life
is
not
the
same
as
the
value
of
a
life
,
but
that
it
matters
when
we’re
trying
to
triage
where
to
donate
or
lend
a
helping
hand
.
EAs
try
to
work
out
how
to
have
the
greatest
.
Many
domestic
issues
are
extremely
important
,
and
there
are
powerful
arguments
for
prioritizing
domestic
issues
in
the
short
term
,
to
make
sure
that
political
,
social
and
economic
progress
sticks
.
But
,
far
too
often
,
such
issues
garner
lots
of
attention
,
and
people
forget
how
far
their
money
can
go
abroad
,
or
don’t
think
about
the
marginal
impact
of
their
donations
or
volunteering
.
Some
causes
receive
huge
support
;
others
not
so
much
.
The
difference
is
not
always
warranted
.
Many
don’t
know
how
cheap
bed
nets
,
women’s
hygiene
products
,
or
micronutrient
supplements
are
.
Many
don’t
know
the
effects
these
can
have
on
far
away
communities
.
We
want
to
know
.
So
,
yes
,
EA
is
more
complicated
than
we
first
intimated
.
The
insights
of
Effective
Altruism
are
not
obvious
,
and
not
uncontroversial
.
If
EA
is
a
question
,
these
ideas
are
the
beginning
of
the
discussion
,
not
the
end
.
As
a
second
semester
senior
,
it
is
hard
not
to
be
reflective
about
my
time
at
Duke
.
With
graduation
a
few
months
away
,
I
have
been
looking
back
at
what
I
have
done
here
and
trying
to
discern
what
I
still
want
to
do
.
So
picture
me
a
few
weeks
ago
,
on
the
first
night
of
black
tenting
,
lying
in
my
sleeping
bag
,
shivering
,
in
the
fetal
position
,
listening
to
my
tent
get
hounded
with
rain
,
and
repeatedly
asking
myself
,
?
It’s
because
what
sets
Duke
apart
is
its
people
.
We
are
surrounded
by
renowned
professors
.
Our
peers
are
nbsp
;
incredible
athletes
,
brilliant
artists
,
and
nbsp
;
thoughtful
intellectuals
from
a
diversity
of
backgrounds
.
People
are
this
university’s
greatest
asset
the
professors
in
front
of
the
classroom
,
the
intelligent
and
passionate
young
people
that
make
up
the
student
body
,
and
the
experts
,
artists
and
activists
willing
to
come
share
their
wisdom
on
our
campus
.
And
in
a
year
,
or
in
a
decade
,
I
won’t
look
back
on
my
time
in
college
and
remember
the
content
that
was
on
my
Spanish
midterm
.
I’ll
remember
being
blown
away
by
my
friend’s
a
cappella
concert
and
making
posters
for
another
friend’s
fencing
match
.
I’ll
remember
the
freezing
cold
slumber
parties
in
K
Ville
and
the
spontaneous
spring
afternoons
spent
in
the
Gardens
.
I’ll
remember
the
dinner
conversation
that
really
pushed
me
and
the
campus
speaker
who
made
me
reconsider
my
viewpoint
.
Our
investment
into
Duke
pays
off
when
we
use
our
time
here
to
grow
and
challenge
ourselves
not
just
as
academics
and
students
,
but
as
well
rounded
people
.
There
will
always
be
more
opportunities
for
me
to
take
classes
.
If
I
want
to
learn
new
content
or
write
more
papers
later
down
the
line
,
I
am
sure
I
will
be
able
to
.
But
this
is
my
last
chance
to
sleep
in
a
tent
with
friends
just
for
the
fun
of
it
.
This
is
my
last
chance
to
take
advantage
of
the
institutional
resources
and
human
capital
that
I
can
only
access
under
the
umbrella
of
this
institution
.
And
most
importantly
,
this
is
my
last
chance
to
be
in
this
insulated
environment
of
young
,
interesting
people
who
challenge
and
fulfill
me
every
day
.
So
in
my
last
semester
,
I
am
challenging
myself
to
step
out
of
routine
and
look
beyond
my
to
do
list
.
I
am
challenging
myself
to
take
advantage
of
the
treasure
trove
of
talent
and
intellect
around
me
before
it
spreads
across
the
country
and
the
world
.
I
am
challenging
myself
to
make
more
time
for
coffee
dates
,
guest
speakers
,
and
excursions
into
Durham
.
And
I
am
challenging
myself
to
pursue
the
opportunities
that
make
Duke
unique
.
Getting
my
degree
is
about
passing
my
classes
.
But
before
that
degree
comes
,
I
hope
I
can
fully
appreciate
that
being
a
Duke
student
is
about
much
,
much
more
.
Centuries
from
now
,
history
will
likely
associate
2018
with
the
birth
of
the
first
genome
edited
babies
.
This
event
,
disclosed
in
November
by
Dr
.
He
Jiankui
from
China
,
dragged
humanity
further
into
a
murky
ethical
quagmire
surrounding
human
embryonic
germline
editing
.
I
stand
with
the
vast
majority
of
my
colleagues
in
the
scientific
community
who
believe
that
that
the
experiment
revealed
in
November
was
ethically
inappropriate
,
lacked
medical
merit
and
failed
to
conform
to
international
norms
.
However
,
despite
this
deeply
flawed
example
of
human
germline
experimentation
,
increasing
investments
and
research
can
benefit
our
society
.
Proper
use
of
genome
editing
can
feed
millions
,
treat
cancer
and
alleviate
suffering
.
Genome
editing
refers
to
mixing
,
adding
and
or
subtracting
building
blocks
of
DNA
those
As
,
Gs
,
Cs
,
and
Ts
that
act
as
a
code
of
every
living
organism
on
our
planet
.
Changes
in
our
DNA
genotype
can
lead
to
changes
in
our
phenotype
,
the
set
of
characteristics
which
include
everything
from
our
eye
color
to
proteins
that
can
increase
or
reduce
risk
of
acquiring
an
infection
or
cancer
.
To
some
,
genome
editing
offers
possibility
of
ridding
humanity
of
devastating
heritable
diseases
.
To
others
,
it
is
a
chance
for
the
rich
and
privileged
to
provide
their
children
with
even
more
advantages
.
Debate
on
the
ethics
and
utility
of
genome
editing
often
overlooks
two
important
considerations
.
The
first
consideration
is
to
what
kind
of
system
genome
editing
is
applied
.
To
most
,
experimentation
in
plants
and
mice
are
ethically
disparate
from
experimentation
in
humans
.
The
second
consideration
is
the
type
of
cell
being
edited
.
Like
consideration
of
the
system
,
a
similar
ethical
dichotomy
exists
when
genome
editing
technology
is
applied
to
somatic
cells
i
.
e
.
,
cells
in
the
body
for
which
changes
cannot
be
passed
to
future
generations
versus
germline
cells
i
.
e
.
,
eggs
,
sperm
,
or
an
early
embryonic
stage
that
results
in
editing
all
or
most
cells
in
a
human
;
therefore
edits
will
enter
our
population
with
a
potential
to
be
passed
to
future
generations
.
Somatic
cell
genetic
engineering
has
occurred
safely
for
over
two
decades
,
and
is
closely
regulated
.
For
example
,
ongoing
clinical
trials
to
treat
disorders
of
red
blood
cells
,
such
as
sickle
cell
disease
,
use
CRISPR
Cas9
to
edit
hemoglobin
genes
in
red
blood
cell
precursors
,
which
are
then
infused
into
patients
.
nbsp
;
Any
changes
,
or
mistakes
,
that
occur
during
this
somatic
cell
editing
process
are
limited
to
the
individual
.
nbsp
;
When
engaging
in
discourse
regarding
genome
editing
technology
,
placing
all
systems
and
cell
types
into
the
same
ethical
basket
is
analogous
to
falsely
equating
different
types
of
nuclear
technology
while
the
merits
of
such
powerful
technology
warrant
thoughtful
debate
and
thorough
scrutiny
,
there
is
a
clear
ethical
distinction
between
using
atomic
energy
to
power
a
city
or
to
bomb
it
.
Applying
genome
editing
technology
to
crops
has
,
and
will
continue
to
,
save
lives
.
Further
investment
in
this
technology
could
help
close
gaps
in
global
inequality
.
Nobel
laureate
Sir
Richard
Roberts
estimates
that
failure
to
utilize
genome
editing
technology
in
plants
to
provide
vitamin
supplementation
has
resulted
in
the
deaths
of
millions
in
resource
poor
countries
.
Potential
misuse
of
most
any
technology
could
have
harmful
effects
on
society
,
and
genome
editing
technologies
for
improving
crop
yields
and
health
benefits
are
no
different
.
However
,
the
degree
of
misinformation
disseminated
about
genetically
modified
organisms
GMOs
seems
higher
relative
to
other
technologies
.
Scare
tactics
,
such
as
that
genetically
modified
plants
will
somehow
cross
DNA
over
into
humans
,
are
not
infrequently
repeated
.
All
plants
we
eat
contain
DNA
,
modified
or
otherwise
.
The
four
DNA
nucleotides
do
not
change
with
genome
editing
.
All
that
changes
is
the
amount
of
,
or
relative
ratio
of
,
these
nucleotides
.
We
digest
the
genomes
from
plant
GMO
or
non
GMO’
DNA
equivalently
.
Eating
a
plant
from
either
a
modified
variant
or
a
normal
variant
conveys
no
risk
of
either
acquiring
,
or
passing
on
to
our
children
,
the
ability
to
photosynthesize
.
Suggestions
that
we
could
acquire
other
traits
or
become
mutants
ourselves
from
eating
genetically
modified
organisms
are
not
founded
in
science
.
While
genome
editing
technology
can
provide
our
planet
with
more
nutrients
to
help
children
grow
up
healthy
,
it
can
also
help
us
as
we
age
.
For
example
,
genome
editing
of
human
somatic
cells
offers
the
opportunity
to
reprogram
our
immune
cells
to
fight
cancer
.
In
recently
FDA
approved
CAR
T
cell
therapy
,
a
patient’s
own
immune
cells
can
be
isolated
,
efficiently
and
specifically
genetically
edited
with
technology
such
as
CRISPR
Cas9
to
target
certain
types
of
cancer
,
and
reintroduced
back
into
her
or
his
body
.
While
this
technology
is
currently
resource
intensive
and
expensive
,
the
promise
of
using
this
technology
to
save
our
loved
ones
is
very
real
.
However
,
without
further
research
and
clinical
trials
utilizing
this
genome
somatic
cell
editing
,
CAR
T
cell
therapy
will
only
target
a
small
subset
of
cancers
and
neither
be
widely
accessible
nor
affordable
.
Similarly
,
using
genome
editing
technology
within
non
germline
cells
such
as
those
grown
in
petri
like
dishes
within
incubators
for
laboratory
research
will
allow
us
to
discover
new
drug
targets
,
as
well
as
provide
us
with
a
deeper
understanding
of
how
our
biological
world
functions
.
Initial
studies
using
recombinant
DNA
in
bacterial
cells
in
the
1970s
,
and
later
mammalian
cells
,
led
to
the
ability
to
synthesize
insulin
,
which
revolutionized
treatment
for
those
with
diabetes
.
In
addition
,
genome
editing
can
be
used
to
quickly
and
efficiency
knock
in
or
knock
out
certain
proteins
in
these
cells
to
see
if
they
might
have
relevance
in
cancer
or
inflammation
.
Genome
editing
of
non
germline
human
cells
in
the
laboratory
has
occurred
for
decades
and
is
responsibly
regulated
.
Introducing
legislative
restrictions
on
genome
editing
without
consideration
for
either
the
system
or
the
cell
type
would
be
profoundly
detrimental
to
scientific
discovery
.
Less
than
a
century
since
Franklin
,
Watson
and
Crick
conducted
foundational
experiments
defining
the
structure
of
DNA
,
the
first
genome
edited
human
babies
have
been
brought
to
term
.
As
our
society
continues
to
grapple
with
ethical
implications
,
let
us
be
wary
of
sweeping
generalities
and
false
equivalencies
that
could
undermine
responsibly
using
genome
editing
technology
to
create
a
more
healthy
and
prosperous
world
for
all
of
us
.
Last
Friday’s
editorial
,
AIPAC
and
the
Blockade
on
Critiquing
Israel
,
perpetuates
troubling
myths
about
the
roles
of
Jews
in
American
politics
,
as
well
as
inaccuracies
about
the
history
of
the
Israeli
Arab
conflict
,
Middle
East
politics
,
and
Zionism
.
For
American
Jews
,
criticism
of
Jewish
pro
Israel
groups
in
the
United
States
for
their
excessive
political
influence
recalls
painful
memories
of
the
grotesque
propaganda
accusing
Jews
of
similar
influence
that
formed
the
basis
for
persecution
and
the
Holocaust
.
Throughout
history
,
anti
Semites
have
advanced
the
view
that
Jews
have
undue
influence
.
Most
notoriously
,
the
book
The
Protocols
of
the
Elders
of
Zion
,
which
was
published
in
the
early
20th
century
,
became
a
foundation
for
Jewish
persecution
over
the
last
hundred
years
throughout
Europe
and
in
the
United
States
.
It
perpetuated
the
myth
of
influence
of
Jews
as
a
way
to
produce
mass
hatred
,
in
the
words
of
Nobel
Peace
Prize
winner
Elie
Wiesel
.
Today
,
the
modern
formulation
of
this
historic
trope
is
to
use
dog
whistles
of
a
similar
theme
by
leaders
around
the
world
including
supporters
and
members
of
the
Trump
administration
who
recklessly
accuse
opponents
of
being
puppets
of
George
Soros
,
a
Jewish
philanthropist
and
Holocaust
survivor
,
whose
work
seeks
to
promote
democracy
and
human
rights
globally
.
I
appreciate
that
Representative
Ilhan
Omar
has
apologized
for
her
tweet
,
and
I
think
she
was
naively
insensitive
about
how
her
comments
would
be
taken
,
even
though
her
play
on
the
word
Benjamin
,
which
in
origin
is
an
Anglicized
version
of
a
Hebrew
name
,
is
ugly
.
And
the
discourse
surrounding
the
broader
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict
,
notably
by
The
Chronicle’s
independent
editorial
board
,
is
troubling
and
hurtful
.
Laying
all
the
blame
on
Israel
for
the
intractable
conflict
is
both
inaccurate
and
misleading
.
It
neglects
to
account
for
the
role
of
groups
like
Hamas
,
an
avowed
terrorist
organization
.
Hamas
,
which
controls
Gaza
,
is
committed
to
eradicating
Israel
and
pushing
the
Jews
into
the
sea
.
The
group’s
leaders
have
used
anti
Semitic
imagery
to
encourage
terror
attacks
against
Israelis
.
Hamas
is
not
interested
in
a
peace
deal
.
Rather
,
it
is
committed
to
murdering
Israelis
.
Its
practice
of
using
Palestinian
civilians
as
human
shields
is
well
documented
.
There
are
valid
grounds
to
criticize
the
current
Israeli
government
of
Benjamin
Netanyahu
.
Expanding
the
settlements
in
the
West
Bank
have
been
an
obstacle
to
peace
.
The
Nation
State
Law
passed
last
summer
fails
to
properly
balance
Israel’s
status
as
a
Jewish
state
and
a
democracy
.
And
it
is
unconscionable
that
Israelis
and
Palestinians
in
the
occupied
West
Bank
live
by
different
and
unequal
laws
.
However
,
movements
such
as
the
Boycott
,
Divestment
,
Sanctions
BDS
Campaign
are
not
serious
about
remedying
any
of
these
issues
.
In
unfairly
demonizing
Israel
and
trafficking
in
anti
Semitism
,
such
groups
repel
advocates
of
a
two
state
solution
and
further
polarize
both
sides
.
Reasonable
people
can
disagree
with
some
of
the
policies
AIPAC
promotes
.
The
group
supports
many
of
Prime
Minister
Netanyahu’s
policies
.
It
opposed
the
Iran
Nuclear
Agreement
and
supported
the
decision
to
move
the
U
.
S
.
embassy
to
Jerusalem
.
Yet
,
while
AIPAC
seeks
to
influence
U
.
S
.
policy
in
the
Middle
East
,
it
is
hardly
alone
.
There
are
thousands
of
lobbying
groups
registered
with
the
U
.
S
.
government
,
including
others
that
seek
to
influence
U
.
S
.
foreign
policy
in
different
directions
,
such
as
J
Street
,
which
advocates
for
a
two
state
solution
.
Contrary
to
the
assertions
of
some
of
its
critics
,
AIPAC
does
not
make
campaign
contributions
.
Most
of
its
work
is
through
advocacy
and
outreach
to
elected
officials
and
American
Jews
.
Additionally
,
many
advocacy
groups
who
encourage
a
strong
U
.
S
.
Israel
relationship
are
Christian
.
It
is
simplistic
and
incorrect
to
claim
that
AIPAC
is
the
main
driver
of
U
.
S
.
policy
toward
Israel
.
Strategic
interests
and
shared
values
play
a
far
more
prominent
role
in
the
American
Israel
relationship
.
And
yes
,
despite
the
assertions
of
some
of
its
critics
,
Israel
is
a
democracy
and
the
only
one
in
the
Middle
East
,
which
is
perhaps
the
most
volatile
region
in
the
world
.
We
can
criticize
Israel
without
delegitimizing
the
Jewish
state
,
just
as
we
can
criticize
Donald
Trump
without
calling
for
an
end
to
the
United
States
.
Calling
Israel
a
settler
colonial
state
trivializes
the
painful
history
of
Jewish
persecution
and
ignores
the
fact
that
Jews
lived
in
Israel
before
being
expelled
by
the
Babylonians
and
then
the
Romans
.
For
2
,
000
years
,
the
Jewish
people
lacked
a
state
.
Jews
immigrated
to
Israel
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
because
they
were
persecuted
in
Europe
.
During
this
time
,
America
offered
only
limited
safe
haven
to
persecuted
Jews
.
In
the
mid
20th
century
,
Arab
governments
,
such
as
those
in
Egypt
and
Iraq
,
expelled
local
Jewish
populations
.
Jews
did
not
arrive
in
Israel
to
colonize
Palestinians
;
they
came
to
flee
persecution
.
It
is
an
ugly
canard
that
Zionism
is
akin
to
white
supremacy
.
In
fact
,
many
white
supremacists
hate
Jews
along
with
other
minorities
.
Zionism
is
a
belief
promoted
in
the
late
19th
century
by
Theodor
Herzl
that
after
centuries
of
persecution
,
Jews
deserve
a
state
.
Anti
Zionism
is
opposition
to
this
belief
.
Those
who
oppose
Zionism
believe
that
centuries
of
persecution
and
the
lack
of
a
secure
homeland
still
do
not
justify
the
creation
of
a
Jewish
state
in
the
land
where
Jews
had
lived
for
thousands
of
years
.
Anti
Zionism
means
holding
Israel
to
different
standards
than
other
countries
.
This
pernicious
ideology
goes
beyond
reasonable
critiques
of
Israeli
policy
,
to
suggest
that
Israel
should
not
exist
as
a
state
for
the
Jewish
people
.
Anti
Zionism
and
anti
Semitism
are
inseparable
.
F
.
Scott
Fitzgerald
once
said
that
the
test
of
a
first
rate
intelligence
is
the
ability
to
hold
two
opposed
ideas
in
mind
at
the
same
time
and
still
retain
the
ability
to
function
.
It
is
too
simplistic
and
factually
inaccurate
to
argue
that
Israel
is
a
colonial
project
,
just
as
it
is
overly
facile
to
assert
that
the
country
always
lives
up
to
its
ideals
as
a
Jewish
democracy
.
Our
community
should
move
on
from
relying
on
tired
anti
Semitic
tropes
that
seek
to
delegitimize
Israel
to
a
more
constructive
debate
about
how
activism
can
promote
an
end
to
seven
decades
of
conflict
and
ensure
that
Israelis
and
Palestinians
can
peacefully
coexist
.
This
incident
,
which
was
all
over
local
and
global
news
by
Saturday
,
January
26
,
2019
,
should
need
no
introduction
by
now
.
Briefly
,
the
director
of
graduate
studies
in
the
Department
of
Biostatistics
in
the
School
of
Medicine
,
sent
an
email
to
the
masters
students
in
the
program
,
warning
them
about
potential
consequences
to
their
access
to
professional
opportunities
within
and
beyond
the
department
for
speaking
a
language
other
than
English
in
a
social
setting
.
The
investigation
on
the
details
are
still
pending
,
but
the
incident
is
a
textbook
case
of
discrimination
against
a
vulnerable
population
as
well
as
a
gross
abuse
of
power
on
many
levels
.
Duke
as
an
educational
institution
,
and
we
as
its
faculty
and
as
its
leaders
should
not
hesitate
or
equivocate
for
a
moment
in
speaking
out
in
the
strongest
terms
against
such
abuses
on
our
campus
immediately
when
they
occur
.
The
incident
is
not
an
isolated
one
,
but
one
in
a
line
of
many
such
discriminatory
acts
targeting
different
groups
that
have
occurred
on
our
campus
in
recent
months
and
years
.
While
there
is
also
a
national
and
global
uptick
in
these
types
of
discriminatory
incidents
,
Duke
has
had
more
than
our
share
,
and
some
of
these
were
more
widely
publicized
and
discussed
than
others
the
hanging
of
a
noose
near
the
Bryan
Center
;
scrawling
of
a
racial
slur
on
a
sign
at
the
Mary
Lou
Williams
Center
for
Black
Culture
;
the
defacement
of
a
mural
celebrating
Latinx
Heritage
Month
;
and
the
engraving
of
swastikas
in
a
bathroom
stall
on
West
Campus
,
etc
.
.
This
is
a
symptom
of
broader
societal
problems
with
deep
historical
roots
,
and
their
legacies
manifest
as
structural
inequalities
in
the
very
fabric
of
our
institution
.
What
is
clear
from
these
multiple
cases
is
that
the
status
quo
at
Duke
is
not
working
and
calls
for
a
reexamination
.
While
acknowledging
the
tremendous
efforts
in
the
wake
of
various
prior
occurrences
Duke
University
Task
Force
on
Bias
and
Hate
Issues
2016
;

;

Force
on
Gender
2018
;
Duke

Force
on

Education

,
etc
.
,
we
note
that
many
of
these
reports
and
recommendations
are
still
to
be
circulated
widely
or
implemented
in
visible
ways
,
sometimes
years
after
the
hard
work
of
the
committees
and
the
submission
of
their
reports
.
What
is
clear
is
that
we
need
to
build
on
these
results
to
do
more
now
.
The
response
of
our
students
has
been
swift
,
decisive
and
eloquent
,
in
the
wake
of
each
of
these
numerous
incidents
.
After
this
latest
one
,
our
students
have
called
on
us
yet
again
to
act
A
Resolution
of
the
Duke
Graduate
and
Professional
Student
Council
on
Linguistic
Racism
at
Duke
University
;
Joint
Statement
by
the
Duke
University
Asian
Students
Association
and
Duke
International
Association
;
Petition
to
Investigate
Professor
Megan
Neely’s
Discriminatory
Emails
,
etc
.
.
They
have
been
working
hard
,
calling
upon
their
peers
and
the
broader
community
,
and
most
of
all
,
to
us
,
their
teachers
to
respond
.
Those
who
have
been
deeply
injured
are
not
limited
to
the
international
students
of
a
particular
country
of
origin
,
speakers
of
a
particular
language
or
members
of
a
particular
race
,
ethnicity
,
department
or
school
.
nbsp
;
This
incident
and
many
like
it
have
impacted
a
great
majority
of
our
students
,
even
our
faculty
and
staff
.
Many
of
our
students
are
traumatized
,
unable
to
focus
on
their
school
work
,
wondering
if
they
belong
here
despite
the
high
tuition
they
pay
and
despite
the
tremendous
contribution
they
make
to
the
culture
of
our
institution
.
The
majority
of
the
students
in
the
Department
of
Biostatistics
,
who
have
been
most
directly
and
explicitly
threatened
by
the
very
professors
who
were
in
charge
of
their
well
being
,
are
understandably
still
too
afraid
to
come
out
and
to
speak
and
share
their
stories
.
One
of
the
most
sobering
and
moving
recent
moments
was
at
a
community
conversation
when
one
of
these
students
sent
in
a
powerful
letter
anonymously
,
translated
and
read
to
us
by
her
peers
who
stood
up
for
her
when
she
could
not
herself
come
forward
.
It
is
not
the
responsibility
of
our
students
to
expose
themselves
to
further
danger
and
injury
in
their
time
of
need
and
vulnerability
.
It
is
our
responsibility
as
those
in
positions
of
leadership
and
power
,
with
adequate
resources
,
to
make
effective
changes
on
their
behalf
.
Our
students
are
watching
us
,
and
now
the
world
is
watching
us
,
to
step
up
and
take
action
now
.
As
someone
who
has
been
in
the
trenches
with
some
of
these
students
,
and
who
has
been
audience
to
the
assessments
of
many
other
faculty
and
staff
,
I
can
assure
you
that
the
ongoing
problem
of
racism
in
our
campus
community
has
reached
a
boiling
point
.
If
we
truly
aspire
to
be
the
global
university
touted
in
our
shiny
pamphlets
and
websites
,
we
the
faculty
need
to
do
more
now
to
effect
change
.
Race
relations
and
racial
dynamics
are
never
easy
.
Duke
,
located
in
the
heart
of
the
American
South
,
with
its
long
and
dark
legacy
of
slavery
and
segregation
,
has
understandably
been
focused
on
the
Black
and
White
divide
.
The
rapid
changes
in
our
current
dynamic
and
demographic
,
within
the
university
and
in
the
communities
around
us
,
call
on
us
to
reflect
on
the
complicated
story
of
race
in
our
community
.
Some
forms
of
racism
are
more
familiar
to
us
historically
,
and
therefore
,
more
easily
recognizable
blackface
,
a
noose
,
a
swastika
,
all
of
which
have
appeared
around
us
recently
,
for
example
,
need
no
explanation
,
and
we
have
no
problems
standing
unequivocally
and
collectively
in
condemnation
in
the
strongest
terms
as
we
should
when
confronted
with
such
heinous
acts
and
symbols
.
However
,
racism
is
tricky
because
it
works
in
multiple
ways
and
wears
many
different
faces
to
target
different
groups
.
For
Asians
and
Asian
Americans
and
others
whose
foreignness
is
assumed
,
even
for
those
born
in
this
country
,
racism
often
targets
their
perceived
otherness
including
the
languages
they
speak
or
the
accents
or
imperfect
speech
that
are
perceived
,
real
or
imagined
.
Because
we
as
an
aspiring
global
university
are
not
yet
fully
equipped
to
understand
the
complexities
of
racism
including
everyday
microaggressions
,
we
more
often
than
not
fail
to
recognize
and
call
out
racism
that
manifests
in
less
familiar
terms
.
nbsp
;
This
results
in
unintended
consequences
of
appearing
to
be
in
solidarity
with
certain
injured
groups
more
than
others
.
We
,
the
faculty
and
leadership
of
Duke
University
at
large
,
have
a
mandate
from
our
students
and
from
our
community
to
act
now
.
We
have
been
charged
with
the
task
to
propose
concrete
and
timely
plans
for
action
now
,
to
change
the
status
quo
.
Fortunately
,
the
Arts
and
Sciences
Council
has
been
charged
with
the
mandate
to
revamp
our
curriculum
.
This
is
a
great
starting
point
for
us
,
but
we
also
need
leadership
from
the
other
schools
and
institutes
.
Following
the
wisdom
of
the
ancient
cultures
of
China
and
Greece
,
in
which
the
word
for
crisis
weiji危机
krisiκρίση
also
means
opportunity
,
we
call
on
the
Duke
leadership
and
faculty
to
turn
this
crisis
and
others
into
an
opportunity
for
us
to
move
towards
an
equitable
future
.
1
Recommend
using
this
crisis
and
others
as
an
opportunity
to
move
away
from
the
repetition
of
the
curriculum
,
assessments
,
hiring
,
promotions
,
adjudication
of
misconduct
,
especially
those
that
involve
faculty
disciplinary
actions
.
Implement
or
update
clear
,
transparent
policies
in
each
unit
and
department
.
Mandate
regular
conversations
with
faculty
at
faculty
meetings
,
make
these
policies
visible
and
easily
navigable
in
the
department
common
spaces
and
websites
.
Provide
training
and
support
resources
for
faculty
,
staff
and
students
.
Office
of
Institutional
Equity
or
Teaching
for
Equity
Fellows
trainings
should
be
mandatory
for
all
chairs
and
department
leaders
,
while
incentives
,
resources
and
encouragement
are
given
to
others
.
nbsp
;
Build
and
improve
upon
past
actions
and
task
force
recommendations
and
tie
these
into
hiring
initiatives
for
more
representation
from
both
faculty
and
university
leadership
,
with
concrete
timelines
for
implementation
3
5
year
plans
.

Recommend
using
this
crisis
and
others
to
provide
adequate
resources
,
course
releases
and
compensation
for
the
faculty
committee
members
who
will
lead
this
university
wide
vision
and
charge
for
the
next
1
2
years
.
Provide
a
commitment
to
transparency
,
to
publish
and
widely
disseminate
the
outcomes
of
investigations
,
update
procedures
of
accountability
and
define
a
clear
timeline
for
taking
action
on
recommendations
before
the
committees
embark
on
their
charges
.
Meeting
new
people
usually
starts
the
same
way
after
the
your
major
obviously
leads
to
a
post
college
career
.
Otherwise
,
you
might
receive
the
classic
response
of
Oh
,
how
do
you
plan
to
make
money
from
that
major
?
Yikes
.
When
I
was
still
thinking
about
attending
medical
schools
,
I
would
always
mention
that
I
was
pre
med
before
I
mentioned
I
was
an
English
major
.
If
I
ever
said
that
I
was
an
English
major
first
,
I
would
make
sure
to
immediately
qualify
my
studies
by
saying
I
was
pre
med
.
The
need
to
justify
my
college
education
with
something
people
see
as
useful
for
obtaining
a
high
paying
job
set
the
tone
for
nbsp
;
these
interactions
.
Conversations
like
these
were
exhausting
and
discouraged
me
from
discussing
my
true
interests
.
Now
that
I
have
dropped
the
pre
med
track
,
I
am
constantly
questioned
as
to
whether
or
not
I
will
be
able
to
make
a
living
.
People
hear
English
major
and
naturally
assume
I’m
destined
to
be
a
poor
writer
,
using
my
struggles
to
fuel
my
fiction
.
Normally
such
people
don’t
follow
up
with
questions
about
my
passions
,
favorite
books
,
interest
in
other
fields
,
or
why
I
chose
English
a
similar
,
but
much
more
intimate
and
meaningful
question
.
So
I
stand
there
trying
to
come
up
with
some
form
of
answer
to
satisfy
the
question
.
I
feel
a
need
to
appease
the
person
with
an
appropriate
response
that
shows
I’ve
thought
about
my
future
thoroughly
.
But
why
should
I
care
what
other
people
think
of
my
major
?
Such
experiences
are
not
limited
to
humanities
majors
,
either
;
students
in
other
disciplines
outside
of
economics
,
computer
science
or
pre
health
,
nbsp
;
are
subjected
to
the
same
derision
.
Pre
professional
students
have
a
clear
defense
about
their
choice
of
study
because
these
courses
of
study
clearly
and
succinctly
translates
to
plans
after
college
.
Even
as
an
English
major
,
I
could
still
pursue
a
postgraduate
degree
.
People
just
assume
I
won’t
.
Even
for
students
who
are
not
pursuing
a
specific
pre
professional
track
in
college
,
there
are
some
majors
that
are
immediately
valued
as
good
investments
.
Math
,
public
policy
,
political
science
,
engineering
majors
are
usually
seen
as
prestigious
,
difficult
as
I’ve
previously
discussed
or
insanely
rigorous
.
Such
majors
are
seen
as
beneficial
in
the
long
run
because
they
have
social
weight
in
the
real
world
,
meaning
people
could
see
a
plethora
of
different
careers
branching
of
their
studies
.
In
a
way
,
these
students
are
still
on
a
type
of
career
path
,
just
one
that’s
not
as
obvious
.
Nonetheless
,
these
majors
appear
to
others
as
ones
that
can
be
used
to
earn
six
figure
jobs
.
My
English
major
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
not
seen
the
same
way
since
the
careers
are
less
obvious
.
Since
people
can’t
see
how
my
major
directly
translates
to
a
career
,
it
is
assumed
I
will
struggle
to
find
a
job
after
college
.
It
is
one
thing
to
ask
what
a
student
plans
to
pursue
after
they
graduate
,
as
that
demonstrates
interest
in
their
desired
career
path
.
You’re
trying
to
learn
more
about
the
individual
and
their
specific
passions
within
their
field
of
study
.
I
find
this
type
of
question
flattering
,
and
an
opportunity
to
discuss
what
specifically
about
English
literature
excites
me
.
It
is
another
to
ask
how
they
plan
to
make
any
money
.
To
do
so
completely
and
immediately
undermines
the
person’s
interests
,
and
instead
places
the
emphasis
on
their
future
salary
and
nothing
more
.
It’s
insulting
and
unrealistic
to
assume
that
a
capable
college
graduate
will
enter
the
world
without
having
any
idea
about
their
future
livelihood
.
At
the
end
of
the
day
,
the
focus
should
not
be
on
the
money
someone
will
potentially
make
,
but
rather
the
joy
and
excitement
the
person
has
for
what
they
want
to
do
.
Being
able
to
sustain
yourself
as
a
working
adult
is
essential
,
and
I
understand
that
,
but
happiness
is
also
salient
in
life
.
Sure
,
money
can
buy
things
that
you
happy
,
but
it
cannot
buy
you
eternal
happiness
.
So
,
if
you
find
yourself
in
one
of
these
interactions
and
you’re
thinking
about
asking
about
how
someone
plans
to
make
money
,
please
don’t
.
Consider
asking
something
else
anything
else
instead
.
Dear
Mihir
,
You
assert
that
Megan
Neely
,
the
former
Director
of
Graduate
Studies
in
Biostatistics
,
who
sent
an
email
chastising
students
for
speaking
Chinese
in
the
department
building
and
warning
them
of
the
potential
negative
impacts
on
their
futures
,
should
not
have
stepped
down
.
I
strongly
disagree
.
Megan
Neely’s
email
to
students
warning
them
against
speaking
in
their
native
languages
,
specifically
Chinese
,
is
a
clear
perpetuation
of
racism
and
xenophobia
.
While
your
statement
that
most
employers
implicitly
demand
good
to
excellent
English
in
their
hiring
process
has
merit
,
Neely’s
email
was
drenched
in
the
inherent
and
incorrect
assumption
that
students
who
choose
to
speak
their
native
language
are
less
equipped
to
speak
English
in
a
work
setting
.
In
order
to
enroll
in
the
Biostatistics
program
,
international
students
must
demonstrate
their
proficiency
in
English
.
Bottom
line
the
students
on
this
campus
already
speak
English
.
Furthermore
,
this
assumption
speaks
to
a
broader
trend
in
this
country
to
treat
being
bilingual
as
a
positive
skill
in
white
,
native
English
speakers
and
as
a
liability
in
non
native
English
speakers
of
color
.
This
is
a
damaging
and
discriminatory
trend
which
needs
to
be
discussed
and
confronted
.
Additionally
,
you
assert
that
Neely
is
just
the
face
of
a
larger
power
structure
and
that
ideologies
aren’t
fought
with
firings
and
scapegoats
they’re
fought
with
discourse
.
nbsp
;
But
Megan
Neely
is
not
a
scapegoat
.
A
scapegoat
is
a
person
who
is
forced
to
bear
the
blame
for
others
and
is
sacrificed
unfairly
.
In
her
email
,
Neely
demonstrated
that
she
is
an
active
perpetuator
of
the
xenophobic
and
racist
ideologies
that
so
deeply
harm
the
students
of
color
on
our
campus
.
While
she
is
the
face
of
a
larger
power
structure
,
she
is
also
a
part
of
that
power
structure
and
she
must
be
held
accountable
.
A
great
challenge
of
confronting
systems
of
oppression
is
that
they
are
so
deeply
and
historically
ingrained
in
our
society
that
it
seems
impossible
.
When
confronting
these
systems
,
discourse
is
important
,
but
so
is
action
.
Megan
Neely
resigning
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
.
It
is
the
beginning
,
not
the
end
,
of
the
action
that
should
be
taking
place
in
response
to
this
attack
on
students
.
The
teachers
who
singled
out
the
students
speaking
Chinese
and
reported
them
to
Neely
should
step
down
as
well
.
nbsp
;
This
process
should
continue
until
the
institution
reflects
the
values
and
the
needs
of
the
students
that
they
serve
.
There
is
nothing
satisfying
about
the
resignation
of
Megan
Neely
.
Her
resignation
is
proof
of
what
many
students
already
know
that
like
in
our
country
at
large
,
racism
is
perpetuated
within
the
highest
levels
of
this
university
.
While
you
are
correct
that
the
ultimate
enemy
will
never
be
a
person
,
but
an
ideology
,
the
truth
is
that
ideologies
like
racism
do
not
exist
without
people
who
perpetuate
them
.
If
we
truly
want
to
see
change
on
our
campus
,
we
must
take
action
as
well
as
engage
in
meaningful
discourse
.
We
must
hold
Megan
Neely
and
every
other
individual
who
actively
perpetuates
these
hateful
ideologies
accountable
.
I
volunteer
most
weeks
at
a
nursing
home
near
Duke
.
I
am
painting
portraits
of
the
residents
there
;
I
work
on
sketches
when
I
visit
.
I
decided
to
do
this
because
I
needed
to
find
a
way
to
connect
art
to
medicine
.
I
needed
a
nice
bullet
point
on
my
pre
med
resume
.
I
did
not
say
this
when
I
started
.
I
said
I
wanted
to
get
better
at
painting
and
to
alleviate
loneliness
in
the
world
.
And
I
do
want
to
do
those
things
.
But
I
think
they
are
motivations
I
gained
after
starting
the
project
,
rather
than
when
beginning
it
.
And
if
I
am
honest
,
it
is
not
as
often
the
desire
to
do
good
as
the
desire
to
succeed
in
my
career
that
gets
me
out
of
bed
to
bike
to
the
nursing
home
.
Being
old
in
a
nursing
home
is
lonely
.
You
are
like
an
adult
treated
like
a
child
.
You
are
confined
to
a
dysfunctional
body
.
The
outside
world
is
moving
fast
and
busy
around
you
,
while
you
are
stuck
in
a
tiny
room
with
a
TV
and
a
wheelchair
.
Periodically
visitors
pop
in
and
throw
you
a
friendly
hour
of
social
contact
,
but
they
have
to
venture
back
to
the
world
that
can’t
accommodate
your
old
age
.
A
lot
of
people
can’t
hear
you
,
or
you
can’t
hear
them
.
You
no
longer
have
a
chance
to
impress
your
importance
on
other
people
;
you
are
entirely
at
their
mercy
for
care
and
conversation
.
For
a
while
I
wondered
if
what
I
was
doing
mattered
.
I
could
not
understand
the
woman
I
was
sketching
.
I
only
asked
her
yes
or
no
questions
because
she
grew
visibly
frustrated
when
I
didn’t
grasp
her
longer
answers
.
I
was
relieved
when
her
sisters
visited
and
also
couldn’t
understand
.
Once
I
visited
while
she
was
eating
breakfast
,
and
I
felt
horribly
invasive
as
I
sketched
her
with
pancake
and
grits
residue
on
her
face
.
But
I
couldn’t
go
at
any
other
time
that
week
,
and
I
needed
my
volunteer
hour
.
I
hear
many
people
at
Duke
complaining
about
the
activities
and
classes
they
engage
in
just
for
their
resume
or
major
.
While
some
of
that
is
necessary
,
I
wonder
if
my
whole
life
will
follow
this
trajectory
of
fake
interest
.
I
want
to
be
a
doctor
partially
because
I
want
to
help
others
.
I
am
scared
my
path
is
not
truly
out
of
desire
to
do
good
in
the
world
,
but
the
intention
of
goodness
is
a
cover
for
less
honorable
motivations
.
Does
it
matter
if
I
do
good
things
but
don’t
actually
care
if
they
help
others
?
When
I
go
to
the
nursing
home
,
I
do
alleviate
loneliness
.
But
I
also
have
a
lot
of
power
in
the
lives
of
the
residents
there
.
Once
the
women
I
was
sketching
waved
her
sisters
out
of
the
way
so
I
could
get
a
clear
view
for
sketching
as
she
beamed
with
pride
,
evidently
pleased
that
she
was
important
enough
to
be
drawn
.
Sometimes
when
I
visit
,
her
happiness
shines
.
She
is
careful
to
be
still
so
I
can
keep
sketching
.
My
visits
matter
to
her
;
they
are
a
bright
spot
in
the
monotony
of
the
nursing
home
that
encompasses
her
whole
life
.
But
for
me
,
they
are
a
once
a
week
ordeal
,
slightly
uncomfortable
and
saddening
.
Often
I
fear
my
older
years
will
end
in
a
similar
place
,
and
so
I
view
visits
with
a
bit
of
trepidation
.
Some
weeks
I
am
too
busy
to
visit
.
It’s
a
small
concession
for
my
schedule
,
but
I
know
it
is
a
disappointment
to
the
woman
I
visit
.
I
have
so
much
influence
over
her
happiness
,
and
it
feels
shallow
that
my
intentions
are
somewhat
driven
by
my
resume
.
I
also
can’t
dedicate
many
hours
to
painting
her
portrait
because
it
is
ancillary
to
my
academics
.
I
am
a
replacement
for
a
friend
for
this
women
,
but
she
began
as
a
project
for
me
.
I
do
care
about
this
woman’s
happiness
after
visiting
so
many
times
.
But
I
know
she
cares
more
about
our
interactions
than
I
do
I
wonder
if
she
knows
too
.
What
if
everything
I
do
is
secretly
in
service
of
my
personal
success
?
I
feel
that
if
that’s
the
case
,
I
can’t
truly
do
good
in
the
world
.
But
after
seeing
this
woman’s
happiness
and
other
instances
of
altruism
,
I
do
want
to
do
good
.
It
feels
wrong
to
speak
of
helping
others
while
partially
molding
your
exterior
character
.
I’m
still
not
sure
how
I
feel
about
the
tension
between
those
two
things
,
and
I’m
especially
not
sure
if
there’s
a
good
way
to
resolve
it
.
I
suppose
that
all
we
can
strive
for
is
to
land
on
the
right
side
of
the
conflict
.
With
just
one
more
day
until
our
Young
Trustee
is
selected
and
just
one
more
week
until
the
student
body
promptly
stops
caring
,
I
feel
obligated
to
weigh
in
on
the
undergraduate
Young
Trustee
candidates
.
Like
everything
else
at
Duke
,
this
process
is
performative
and
ultimately
pointless
,
but
still
requires
an
ungodly
amount
of
time
and
attention
.
The
Young
Trustee
does
not
even
truly
get
to
act
as
an
advocate
for
their
so
called
platform
the
job
description
calls
for
someone
to
serve
as
a
holistic
representative
of
the
university
.
Nonetheless
,
as
every
white
liberal
will
say
,
if
there’s
anything
to
be
learned
from
the
2016
election
,
it’s
to
get
out
and
vote
!
However
,
I
have
a
personal
dilemma
that
I
find
much
more
pressing
than
knowing
which
senior
will
spend
the
next
three
years
as
a
meaningless
figurehead
puppet
of
Duke’s
administration
.
I
am
concerned
about
Valentine’s
Day
.
Most
importantly
,
I
am
concerned
about
who
I
will
be
spending
Valentine’s
Day
with
.
Seeing
the
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
this
university
wide
popularity
contest
,
I
decided
to
combine
my
desire
to
be
an
informed
voter
with
my
selfish
interests
.
Using
my
best
investigative
journalism
skills
,
I
sought
to
see
which
candidate
has
the
best
personality
in
other
words
,
who
would
be
the
most
datable
.
I’d
know
who
to
vote
for
and
who
to
take
out
on
Thursday
!
Win
or
lose
,
they’d
have
my
heart
.
The
first
to
respond
to
my
invitation
was
Trey
Walk
.
Remarkably
on
brand
,
he
suggested
we
attend
Friday’s
Me
Too
Monologues
show
and
go
out
for
drinks
afterwards
.
Throughout
the
show
,
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
,
me
too
into
my
ear
each
time
one
of
his
marginalized
identity
groups
was
mentioned
.
As
you
can
imagine
,
this
got
pretty
old
.
By
the
fourth
monologue
,
I
longed
to
hear
the
story
of
girl
who
left
her
top
tier
sorority
to
no
longer
feel
complicit
in
a
demeaning
and
oppressive
system
just
something
to
make
Trey
seem
less
relatable
.
We
never
made
it
to
drinks
.
Two
hours
of
sadness
porn
left
both
of
us
too
drained
to
continue
the
night
.
As
we
exited
East
Duke
,
he
offered
me
a
hug
and
said
he
had
a
great
time
.
Me
too
,
I
replied
,
and
we
parted
ways
.
Saturday
morning
,
I
woke
up
to
a
text
from
Brian
Buhr
.
I’m
too
busy
for
a
real
date
right
now
,
he
explained
,
mentioning
a
laundry
list
of
errands
he
had
on
top
of
his
typical
weekend
obligations
.
Nevertheless
,
I
persisted
,
offering
to
accompany
him
on
his
errands
.
Soon
enough
,
I
found
myself
sitting
outside
of
a
J
.
Crew
fitting
room
,
deciding
which
pair
of
chinos
went
best
with
Brian’s
scarf
du
jour
.
After
several
hours
of
watching
him
debate
the
merits
of
every
cable
knit
sweater
in
Southpoint
,
I
couldn’t
help
but
to
feel
like
I
was
running
errands
with
my
dad
.
Maybe
it
was
the
fact
I
invited
myself
,
but
the
whole
date
felt
artificial
and
forced
.
I
craved
spontaneity
or
,
at
the
very
least
,
a
conversation
that
didn’t
feel
like
a
job
interview
.
Before
we
headed
into
Brooks
Brothers
,
I
thanked
Brian
for
letting
me
tag
along
and
called
myself
an
Uber
.
After
my
morning
as
personal
shopper
extraordinaire
,
all
I
wanted
to
do
was
spend
some
time
alone
,
preferably
with
a
nap
and
Netflix
.
I
posted
a
quick
Instagram
story
of
my
computer
in
bed
and
soon
received
a
reply
from
the
luke4yt
account
.
Netflix
and
chill
?
Lol
,
the
message
read
,
and
I
immediately
replied
,
sure
.
When
Luke
Farrell
and
I
finally
met
up
,
he
told
me
he
was
just
kidding
around
in
his
message
and
does
not
at
all
condone
displays
of
toxic
masculinity
.
Hoping
to
push
past
any
of
the
overly
platform
y
chit
chat
,
I
asked
him
to
pick
a
show
for
us
to
watch
.
He
chose
Black
Mirror
,
explaining
that
he’s
just
sucha
nerd
,
because
he’s
studying
computer
science
and
is
super
into
AI
.
I
asked
him
if
his
Instagram
account
was
run
by
AI
and
received
an
over
exuberant
laugh
.
Before
he
could
further
explain
his
future
hopes
for
AI
,
I
asked
if
we
could
just
start
the
show
.
Following
three
episodes
all
full
of
excruciating
commentary
,
I
got
ready
to
return
to
the
comfort
of
my
home
.
Before
I
reached
the
door
,
Luke
asked
me
to
stay
for
two
more
minutes
he
wanted
a
selfie
to
put
on
his
Instagram
story
to
show
my
endorsement
.
I
politely
declined
.
Just
as
our
brief
rendezvous
began
via
Instagram
,
it
ended
the
same
way
.
As
the
last
of
my
four
dates
,
Archana
Ahlawat
and
I
went
to
The
Commons
for
Sunday
Brunch
.
When
I
questioned
her
venue
of
choice
,
she
was
baffled
.
I
just
love
Duke
,
she
said
,
why
would
I
ever
want
to
leave
an
institution
that
has
done
so
much
for
me
!
?
That
was
all
I
needed
to
hear
.
I
sat
and
ate
my
eggs
Benedict
in
silence
,
nodding
as
I
listened
to
her
opinions
on
the
current
circus
of
Democrats
vying
for
the
2020
nomination
and
the
concurrent
circus
of
women
vying
for
Colton
Underwood’s
attention
on
The
Bachelor
.
Archana’s
involvement
with
Duke
Conversations
makes
perfect
sense
.
Our
date
felt
exactly
like
one
one
sided
,
lifeless
,
and
lacking
any
true
substance
.
Promptly
at
12
30
p
.
m
.
,
we
split
the
check
and
she
ran
to
a
super
important
meeting
,
thanking
me
for
my
productive
dialogue
and
a
fresh
perspective
.
I
returned
to
my
room
,
having
lost
30
food
points
and
having
gained
nothing
.
Much
to
my
disappointment
but
not
to
my
surprise
,
I
did
not
receive
a
text
back
from
any
of
the
candidates
.
I
know
I
will
spend
my
Valentine’s
Day
alone
,
but
it’s
not
my
fault
.
The
common
denominator
in
all
of
these
dates
wasn’t
me
it
was
the
candidates
,
more
specifically
the
type
of
person
we
nominate
for
Young
Trustee
.
The
four
people
are
supposed
to
be
the
best
personalities
our
university
can
offer
,
but
they’re
exactly
like
everyone
else
.
Beneath
a
veneer
of
student
organization
endorsements
and
self
assuredness
,
these
people
are
just
awkward
Duke
students
who
want
to
boost
their
resume
.
However
,
I’m
not
,
and
I
still
will
be
single
on
Valentine’s
Day
.
During
this
Lunar
New
Year
festival
,
I
felt
an
incredible
amount
of
pride
for
being
Asian
American
.
I
wish
this
feeling
wasn’t
something
rare
for
me
,
but
it
is
.
Although
I’ve
always
looked
Asian
to
others
,
my
ownership
of
being
Asian
American
has
been
sub
par
to
say
the
least
.
Only
recently
have
I
been
able
to
wholeheartedly
embrace
my
Asian
American
identity
.
However
,
in
my
experiences
,
I’ve
found
that
my
racial
identity
hasn’t
initially
come
from
a
connection
to
the
Asian
American
community
,
but
rather
from
a
rejection
by
the
white
community
.
Last
month
,
I
requested
my
admissions
records
for
viewing
,
and
the
first
thing
I
noticed
was
ASIAN
written
on
the
header
.
I
was
pissed
at
first
,
since
I
had
put
down
mixed
race
specifically
and
written
an
extensive
sob
story
about
the
nuances
of
my
race
.
My
initial
reaction
was
anger
that
I
had
been
boxed
into
this
terse
label
that
gave
no
insight
on
my
half
Korean
identity
.
During
the
application
process
,
I
attempted
to
separate
myself
from
the
Asian
label
,
and
the
misconstrued
stereotype
of
a
studious
,
one
faceted
candidate
that
comes
with
that
.
When
looking
at
my
application
review
just
last
month
,
my
underlying
feelings
of
detachment
from
my
Asian
identity
resurfaced
.
I
realized
that
I
did
not
just
have
this
sentiment
in
my
application
,
but
also
in
the
rest
of
my
life
I’ve
been
scared
to
be
Asian
.
I
tried
my
best
to
be
white
.
I
have
a
white
father
and
I
never
learned
Korean
.
I
grew
up
in
various
suburbs
and
did
the
standard
white
American
activities
I
played
ice
hockey
and
sailed
every
summer
.
I
put
on
copious
amounts
of
sunscreen
before
I
went
outside
,
pretending
that
I
would
burn
.
I
bashed
a
giant
hole
into
the
wall
of
my
house
.
My
self
portraits
in
elementary
school
were
both
poorly
drawn
and
extremely
Anglo
Saxon
.
I
even
applied
to
Duke
,
the
final
step
in
my
white
childhood
fantasy
.
White
people
didn’t
let
me
be
white
.
They
made
comments
,
jokes
,
and
off
hand
remarks
that
drew
attention
to
me
being
Asian
when
otherwise
I
wouldn’t
have
brought
it
up
.
And
I
am
glad
that
they
did
that
.
If
they
hadn’t
constantly
reminded
me
that
I
look
Asian
,
I
probably
would’ve
forgotten
.
I
tried
to
turn
my
back
on
the
Asian
American
community
,
in
fear
that
I
would
be
absorbed
in
a
stereotype
.
For
so
long
,
I
missed
out
on
a
culture
that
had
been
ever
present
in
my
life
since
the
very
beginning
.
It’s
been
my
time
at
Duke
that
has
really
allowed
me
to
connect
to
the
Asian
American
community
,
and
embrace
that
side
of
me
that
often
lays
dormant
.
I
am
grateful
for
my
appreciation
of
my
own
Korean
identity
,
and
I
only
wish
I
had
developed
it
earlier
.
My
cultural
traditions
were
things
I
rarely
spoke
of
or
bothered
trying
to
learn
about
.
Now
,
when
I
investigate
the
pieces
of
Korean
culture
that
are
scattered
in
my
memory
,
I
realize
their
importance
and
how
far
reaching
in
my
life
they
truly
were
.
Whether
it
is
blowing
my
RA
stipend
on
groceries
from
H
mart
,
or
driving
to
Annandale
,
Virginia
for
Korean
BBQ
,
I
am
constantly
finding
ways
to
revive
my
dormant
identity
.
My
Asian
American
pride
has
greatly
been
influenced
by
the
modern
generation
of
displaced
Asian
youths
around
the
world
.
The
Facebook
group
Subtle
Asian
Traits
reminds
me
that
my
experiences
and
cultural
tastes
have
been
influenced
by
my
Asian
identity
,
even
if
in
the
subtlest
forms
.
I
have
developed
an
addiction
to
boba
,
and
I
stan
Blackpink
.
The
bonds
I’ve
formed
with
my
Asian
American
friends
at
Duke
have
been
stronger
than
I
have
ever
experienced
.
As
someone
who
wanted
to
be
white
for
so
long
,
it’s
cathartic
to
feel
a
sense
of
community
with
my
Asian
American
peers
.
At
a
Lunar
New
Year
event
last
week
,
the
faculty
in
residence
of
my
dorm
brought
in
a
folk
musician
who
played
the
guzheng
.
When
she
found
out
I
was
Korean
,
she
played
Arirang
for
me
,
and
I
teared
up
.
It
reminded
me
of
my
older
brother
playing
the
song
,
an
iconic
Korean
folk
tune
,
on
the
trumpet
at
a
middle
school
performance
.
I
remember
watching
my
mom’s
reaction
and
seeing
a
glimpse
of
what
it
meant
to
her
.
It’s
a
simple
song
,
but
it
tells
a
story
of
pain
and
resilience
through
unbelievable
hardship
.
It
took
me
back
to
a
land
that
I
never
experienced
or
lived
in
,
but
that
I
still
feel
within
me
,
through
the
whispers
of
my
family’s
memories
.
For
many
Asian
Americans
in
my
generation
,
it
is
tempting
for
us
to
further
assimilate
into
white
American
culture
.
Those
of
us
at
elite
institutions
are
experiencing
newfound
opportunities
that
our
families
sacrificed
immensely
to
give
to
us
.
And
therefore
,
we
have
many
choices
about
how
we
incorporate
our
Asian
identities
into
our
future
lives
.
The
Asian
diaspora
presents
us
with
an
opportunity
to
choose
how
much
of
our
culture
we
carry
on
,
and
which
parts
we
abandon
.
For
assimilated
or
mixed
Asian
Americans
,
we
can
use
our
place
in
society
to
advocate
for
people
of
Asian
descent
who
don’t
blend
in
as
well
as
we
do
.
We
can
also
choose
to
disavow
the
anti
blackness
and
colorism
in
Asian
American
spheres
,
and
form
racial
coalitions
.
We
can
refuse
to
propagate
the
model
minority
myth
,
and
acknowledge
our
growing
privilege
in
many
sectors
of
society
.
There
is
opportunity
for
change
and
activism
as
a
result
of
the
Asian
diaspora
,
and
for
this
generation
I
believe
it
can
be
exciting
.
From
President
Donald
Trump’s
early
morning
rants
to
the
hashtag
origins
of
the
now
international
Black
Lives
Matter
movement
,
Twitter
has
increasingly
become
the
digital
platform
of
choice
for
U
.
S
.
political
discourse
.
The
geopolitical
and
financial
relationship
between
the
United
States
and
Israel
has
been
no
exception
.
Over
the
weekend
,
freshman
Minnesota
Representative
Ilhan
Omar
tweeted
It’s
all
about
the
Benjamins
in
response
to
a
tweet
that
questioned
recent
bipartisan
attempts
by
U
.
S
.
politicians
to
criminalize
boycotts
of
Israeli
products
and
services
.
When
asked
to
clarify
who
she
thought
was
paying
American
politicians
to
be
pro
Israel
,
Omar
responded
AIPAC
!
referencing
the
U
.
S
.
based
,
pro
Israel
public
affairs
committee
.
The
tweet
drew
some
deserved
criticism
for
her
admittedly
ill
conceived
wording
,
and
Omar
subsequently
offered
an
apology
.
However
,
what
has
been
lost
in
the
spectacle
is
that
the
congresswoman
is
right
AIPAC
has
a
considerable
influence
over
American
politicians
and
legislation
.
Pundits
and
politicians
both
Republicans
and
Democrats
immediately
admonished
and
silenced
Representative
Omar’s
attempts
to
question
AIPAC’s
outsized
and
damaging
role
in
American
politics
by
labeling
her
as
anti
Semitic
.
The
firestorm
of
events
surrounding
Omar’s
correct
assertion
that
a
powerful
lobbying
group
hold
sway
over
politicians
is
indicative
of
just
how
difficult
it
is
to
have
substantive
conversations
about
Israel’s
occupation
of
Palestine
.
The
representative
didn’t
even
delve
into
how
AIPAC
has
ensured
that
Israel
remains
one
of
the
top
recipients
of
U
.
S
.
foreign
aid
without
having
to
answer
for
the
295
Palestinians
killed
and
29
,
000
injured
by
Israeli
forces
in
2018
.
Nor
did
she
demand
attention
be
paid
to
multiple
reported
war
crimes
committed
by
the
settler
state
.
Yet
,
Omar
received
harsher
backlash
for
her
poorly
worded
tweet
than
Steve
King
,
who
recently
questioned
why
white
supremacy
is
offensive
,
illustrating
that
it
is
clearly
especially
hard
to
critique
Israel
when
you
are
Black
,
Muslim
or
both
.
Over
the
last
few
months
Black
internationalist
activists
including
Angela
Davis
and
Marc
Lamont
Hill
have
incurred
material
consequences
for
their
critiques
of
Israel’s
murderous
policies
in
Palestine
.
These
attacks
occur
as
American
politicians
work
to
criminalize
individuals
and
businesses
that
participate
in
the
pro
Palestinian
Boycott
,
Divestment
and
Sanctions
movement
and
the
Israeli
state
continues
to
kill
Palestinian
activists
protesting
Israel’s
12
year
blockade
of
Gaza
.
The
fact
that
American
politicians
are
more
committed
to
anti
Blackness
and
Islamophobia
than
they
are
to
scrutinizing
the
inhumane
treatment
of
Palestinians
conditions
that
the
U
.
S
.
actively
bankrolls
through
its
funding
of
Israel’s
military
is
symptomatic
of
the
U
.
S
.
state’s
long
history
of
settler
colonialism
a
logic
that
Israel
has
replicated
in
Palestine
.
This
attitude
is
also
emblematic
of
U
.
S
.
politicians'
long
tradition
of
courting
corporations
and
lobbyists
for
monetary
donations
at
the
expense
of
Americans
and
those
impacted
by
U
.
S
.
policy
abroad
.
Although
Rep
.
Omar’s
tweets
could
have
been
more
sensitive
and
cautious
indeed
,
language
matters
she
rightfully
critiqued
AIPAC
for
leveraging
its
monetary
resources
to
to
generate
congressional
support
for
Israel
and
its
genocidal
policies
.
The
logic
undergirding
AIPAC’s
mission
is
not
unique
,
and
yet
even
as
Democrats
critique
the
influence
of
oil
corporations
in
U
.
S
.
policy
on
climate
change
,
or
the
wide
ranging
influence
of
the
National
Rifle
Association
on
gun
policy
,
critiques
of
pro
Israel
lobbies
are
not
only
threatening
to
establishment
politicians
but
also
interpreted
as
deeply
offensive
and
hurtful
,
as
House
Speaker
Nancy
Pelosi
put
it
.
At
the
root
of
these
accusations
is
a
refusal
to
differentiate
between
anti
Zionist
critiques
and
anti
Semitism
.
While
anti
Semitism
has
continued
to
proliferate
across
the
United
States
,
even
infiltrating
our
own
communities
here
at
Duke
and
in
Durham
,
there
have
been
consistent
and
deliberate
efforts
to
conflate
anti
Semitism
with
critiques
of
Israel’s
settler
colonial
practices
maneuvers
that
contort
the
legitimate
political
and
social
claims
of
Palestinians
,
as
well
as
the
wellbeing
of
Jewish
communities
.
Similarly
dangerous
conflations
have
frequently
been
made
on
Duke’s
campus
.
Jewish
people
are
often
imagined
as
always
already
pro
Israel
,
while
others
who
critique
Israel
are
often
labeled
anti
Semitic
.
This
false
binary
hinges
on
an
anti
Semitic
conflation
of
Judaism
with
Zionist
settler
colonialism
and
it
negates
the
possibility
of
important
conversations
that
are
long
overdue
,
given
the
hostility
that
student
groups
who
advocate
for
Palestinians
are
met
with
.
It
also
erases
the
radical
activism
of
many
Jews
around
the
world
who
have
bravely
stood
against
both
Israel’s
settler
colonialism
and
the
U
.
S
.
’s
imperial
policies
,
like
Jewish
Voices
for
Peace
.
In
a
globalized
age
where
our
fates
are
deeply
entangled
even
across
borders
,
it
is
critical
that
we
engage
with
this
issue
.
A
critical
analysis
of
how
Israel
and
the
US
have
emerged
as
nation
states
over
time
allows
us
to
an
understanding
of
the
ways
that
state
violence
connects
us
transnationally
.
Through
such
an
analysis
,
an
interrogation
of
AIPAC
not
only
becomes
important
,
but
obligatory
not
just
for
Omar
,
but
for
all
Americans
committed
to
justice
more
broadly
.
The
missiles
used
to
destroy
Palestinian
communities
in
Gaza
are
in
part
funded
by
US
tax
dollars
;
the
tactics
used
to
surveil
and
police
Black
communities
in
many
cities
across
the
US
are
the
product
of
collaborations
between
U
.
S
.
police
and
Israel
police
and
military
forces
.
In
the
wake
of
those
exchanges
are
hundreds
of
Black
and
Palestinian
bodies
the
victims
of
US
and
Israel
state
violence
.
The
only
approach
that
can
liberate
us
all
is
a
rigorous
and
unyielding
international
solidarity
,
from
Ferguson
to
Gaza
,
as
many
Black
organizers
have
put
it
.
Whether
it
is
calling
politicians
to
account
for
enabling
Israel's
occupation
or
participating
in
local
divestment
efforts
,
solidarity
is
imperative
.
Palestinian
activists
in
Palestine
and
across
the
diaspora
regularly
make
this
call
to
action
and
radical
Black
and
Jewish
organizers
across
the
United
States
have
acted
on
it
.
It
is
high
time
that
more
Duke
students
heed
this
call
to
action
too
.
Last
week
,
to
the
shock
of
many
students
,
an
article
on
the
2018
Duke
Student
Experience
Survey
revealed
a
scandalous
statistic
48
percent
.
The
report
chronicled
student
experiences
around
sexual
assault
and
harassment
as
well
as
their
perceptions
of
campus
restorative
systems
.
The
standout
headline
among
the
75
pages
of
the
report
is
the
result
that
48
percent
of
female
survey
takers
reported
being
sexually
assaulted
while
at
Duke
,
up
from
40
percent
in
2016
.
While
speaking
about
sexual
assault
strictly
through
cold
percentages
does
a
disservice
to
its
very
human
victims
,
these
deeply
disturbing
numbers
frame
our
understanding
of
the
full
extent
of
the
violence
perpetuated
here
at
Duke
.
It
may
be
hard
to
pinpoint
what
factors
may
have
caused
this
increase
whether
it
is
a
result
of
actual
growing
rates
of
sexual
assault
or
whether
survey
respondents
felt
more
comfortable
disclosing
their
experiences
but
nonetheless
this
data
remains
troubling
for
us
as
a
campus
community
.
Rates
of
sexual
assault
that
are
this
high
at
a
school
which
purportedly
prides
itself
on
representing
a
safe
,
diverse
community
,
speak
volumes
about
how
poorly
we
reconcile
our
own
complicit
involvement
on
the
matter
.
Procedures
and
policies
at
Duke
are
partly
to
blame
for
failing
sexual
assault
victims
.
According
to
the
survey
,
less
than
60
percent
of
female
undergraduate
respondents
reported
they
thought
Duke
would
take
their
case
seriously
if
they
were
assaulted
and
an
abysmal
38
percent
of
female
undergraduates
reported
that
Duke
properly
investigates
sexual
assault
.
A
lack
of
faith
in
this
system
not
only
directly
leads
to
underreporting
of
violence
,
but
also
speaks
to
how
little
the
voices
and
experiences
of
sexual
assault
victims
are
valued
on
this
campus
,
specifically
when
those
victims
are
female
,
queer
,
non
white
and
or
disabled
.
This
is
not
just
an
administrative
problem
and
cannot
simply
be
resolved
through
a
simple
policy
change
.
The
culture
that
we
create
and
perpetuate
on
this
campus
determines
the
perception
we
have
of
those
around
us
and
it
is
our
burden
as
students
to
change
it
when
people
are
not
valued
.
Our
conception
of
what
community
represents
on
this
campus
remains
extremely
limited
.
While
we
create
community
among
our
friends
,
among
living
groups
and
Greek
organizations
,
we
are
taught
more
than
anything
else
to
make
our
Duke
experiences
about
ourselves
,
focusing
on
getting
the
most
out
of
this
school
regardless
of
how
it
affects
the
people
that
surround
us
.
This
lack
of
communal
empathy
and
understanding
is
part
of
the
reason
why
there
exists
such
large
disparities
between
the
ways
that
male
and
female
respondents
felt
about
identical
processes
there
was
a
19
percentage
point
difference
between
male
and
female
respondents
who
thought
Duke
properly
investigates
sexual
assault
.
A
guilty
verdict
by
Student
Conduct
for
sexual
assault
is
not
the
sole
indicator
of
whether
the
assaulter
should
feel
remorse
.
We
hesitate
to
call
out
the
actions
of
our
friends
or
peers
who
harass
others
through
words
and
behavior
because
of
how
it
could
negatively
impact
such
friendships
.
Neither
of
these
approaches
centers
the
victims
of
these
actions
,
who
are
oftentimes
forced
to
confront
the
aftermath
of
non
consensual
sexual
contact
alone
.
Our
focus
for
sexual
assault
prevention
and
response
should
follow
a
restorative
justice
framework
at
all
levels
.
Restorative
justice
seeks
to
center
the
healing
of
the
person
who
was
harmed
and
is
founded
in
a
communal
focus
on
listening
and
empathy
These
frameworks
have
been
successfully
adopted
at
an
institutional
level
by
other
universities
as
part
of
the
student
conduct
side
of
assault
,
but
we
should
seek
to
adopt
them
within
the
smaller
communities
in
which
we
exist
at
Duke
.
However
,
being
able
to
successfully
implement
these
practices
requires
an
active
effort
to
listen
to
those
around
us
and
incorporate
the
feedback
of
sexual
assault
victims
.
The
Student
Experience
Survey
serves
as
a
basis
for
how
we
understand
the
experiences
of
victims
of
sexual
assault
and
harassment
at
Duke
,
and
while
these
most
recent
results
are
cause
for
deep
concern
and
alarm
,
they
are
also
an
indictment
of
a
problematic
campus
culture
that
allows
us
to
see
so
many
of
our
peers
assaulted
.
Assault
prevention
and
response
strategies
place
an
undue
burden
on
victims
of
assault
to
report
their
assaults
,
deal
with
the
repercussions
of
the
student
conduct
process
and
to
advocate
for
changes
in
policy
and
culture
.
There
are
policy
changes
that
are
necessary
to
ensure
the
safety
and
inclusion
of
students
who
are
more
vulnerable
,
but
no
policy
change
that
comes
from
an
administrative
level
will
be
able
to
change
students
perceptions
of
what
it
means
to
be
an
active
part
of
the
Duke
community
.
So
,
here
we
are
in
2019
.
We
haphazardly
make
a
list
of
goals
we
want
to
achieve
go
to
Wilson
at
least
once
this
semester
,
eat
Sprout
occasionally
,
actually
eat
lunch
with
your
friend
who
hasn’t
seen
you
in
six
months
because
you’re
consumed
by
caffeine
,
courses
and
the
chaos
of
Duke
.
What
else
makes
it
on
that
list
?
Oh
yeah
,
maybe
I
should
start
reading
more
.
Surprisingly
,
this
one
resolution
is
the
seventh
most
common
New
Year’s
resolution
.
17
percent
of
people
say
they
want
to
finally
crack
open
that
novel
collecting
dust
on
their
bookshelf
.
As
Duke
students
,
I’m
sure
reading
is
high
on
our
list
of
resolutions
too
.
Many
of
us
were
ferocious
readers
as
children
,
eating
up
the
Percy
Jackson
series
and
staying
up
late
on
school
nights
to
read
Harry
Potter
.
Then
,
we
got
older
,
and
by
high
school
and
college
we
just
stopped
.
We
become
inundated
with
college
applications
,
APs
and
SATs
,
and
that
favorite
pastime
of
reading
become
a
distant
memory
.
At
Duke
,
the
same
mentality
applies
we
have
a
plethora
of
course
work
to
concern
ourselves
with
first
and
foremost
.
What
used
to
be
an
exciting
escape
for
most
us
is
now
just
seen
as
a
warm
remembrance
.
A
lot
of
us
simply
do
not
read
anymore
.
Let
me
be
more
specific
None
of
us
read
do
something
,
and
those
reasons
are
pretty
easy
to
come
by
.
One
reason
,
however
,
that
I
seem
hear
a
lot
is
that
reading
is
just
not
a
good
use
of
our
time
.
Here
is
where
I
want
to
pause
,
because
I
believe
this
is
the
meat
of
the
issue
at
hand
.
I
think
a
lot
of
us
fancy
the
idea
of
reading
more
but
fail
to
see
the
value
of
investing
time
into
reading
on
our
own
.
Reading
is
actually
extremely
beneficial
to
key
areas
of
our
lives
that
we
utilize
frequently
as
college
students
increased
memory
,
better
concentration
,
improved
writing
skills
,
increased
expression
of
creativity
,
the
development
of
a
more
robust
vocabulary
,
and
can
even
be
beneficial
in
cognitive
stimulation
.
Personally
,
I
hear
a
lot
of
my
friends
complain
about
disliking
writing
or
not
being
great
writers
,
but
little
do
they
know
that
reading
more
often
can
help
make
you
a
better
writer
.
Even
billionaire
Warren
Buffet
endorses
the
value
of
reading
whenever
you
can
whatever
you
can
.
Buffet
continually
discusses
the
importance
of
reading
a
multitude
of
different
books
in
order
to
improve
different
aspects
of
your
life
.
As
one
of
the
most
successful
men
in
the
world
,
his
methods
might
be
something
to
consider
.
Clearly
,
reading
is
an
essential
part
of
developing
we
are
as
individuals
and
who
we
are
students
.
Reading
helps
us
access
different
parts
of
our
brain
and
personality
that
we
do
not
always
encounter
on
a
daily
basis
.
This
increased
exploration
of
ourselves
in
our
powerful
thing
to
undertake
and
can
help
to
strengthen
both
our
personal
identities
and
sense
of
self
.
Additionally
,
we
could
all
use
an
exercise
that
helps
us
become
the
best
students
we
can
.
This
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
came
to
such
an
elite
university
in
the
first
place
.
We
,
as
individuals
,
should
nbsp
;
consider
putting
aside
20
or
30
minutes
,
once
a
week
,
to
just
read
anything
we
wish
to
read
;
to
enter
another
world
or
learn
more
about
something
you’re
super
interested
in
.
Most
importantly
,
choose
the
reading
yourself
and
immerse
yourself
in
that
environment
.
I
know
we
are
all
busy
,
but
we
could
use
a
little
sliver
of
time
just
to
our
personal
wellbeing
and
personal
growth
.
Even
if
it’s
just
a
small
portion
of
your
week
,
you’re
working
to
develop
a
healthy
habit
that
will
help
us
grow
as
individuals
and
students
.
As
Cameron
Crazies
prepare
for
one
of
the
most
anticipated
games
of
the
season
,
the
jubilant
anticipatory
buzz
has
been
disrupted
slightly
by
a
recent
administrative
decision
regarding
the
annual
pre
game
gathering
in
K
Ville
.
Last
week
,
administration
announced
that
only
those
who
tented
for
the
Carolina
Duke
game
would
be
granted
entrance
to
Krzyzewskiville
between
3
p
.
m
.
and
9
p
.
m
.
This
procedural
change
comes
after
last
year’s
drunken
mob
fiasco
and
lax
alcohol
enforcement
.
As
a
result
,
a
Facebook
event
has
surfaced
with
over
400
students
marked
as
either
going
or
interested
entitled
K
Ville
Peaceful
Protest
.
The
description
of
the
event
states
that
the
protest
will
primarily
be
a
tailgate
and
linked
to
another
event
called
Abele
Quad
Kville’
Tailgate
.
The
concern
at
hand
is
not
necessarily
the
frustration
that
students
cannot
congregate
to
participate
in
drunken
camaraderie
over
sports
the
quintessential
collegiate
pastime
.
Rather
,
it’s
the
amount
of
vigor
and
energy
behind
rallying
for
something
so
trivial
compared
to
the
limited
student
mobilization
around
issues
such
as
threats
of
health
care
being
taken
away
from
the
financial
aid
package
or
current
ICE
raids
across
North
Carolina
.
This
instance
of
selective
and
self
serving
student
organizing
not
an
outlier
on
campus
.
The
event
follows
a
history
of
nbsp
;
consumer
oriented
student
activism
,
such
as
outrage
over
Grace’s
Cafe
and
Quenchers
shutting
down
.
Another
recent
example
is
the
energized
momentum
behind
Young
Trustee
campaigns
which
are
,
by
and
large
,
facetiously
pitched
to
students
as
bringing
about
progressive
change
on
campus
,
when
it
will
mostly
just
serve
the
university
as
an
institution
,
powerful
people
with
investments
in
the
university
and
the
Young
Trustee’s
résumé
.
While
a
large
portion
of
the
undergraduate
population
is
hesitant
to
get
involved
in
organizing
around
issues
like
a
much
needed
hate
and
bias
policy
or
graduate
student
financial
precarity
,
students
jump
to
rally
around
the
famous
campus
cat
,
Peaches
,
for
housing
and
healthcare
.
Or
to
bring
Cardi
B
to
campus
through
Tinder
.
Or
to
donate
to
a
GoFundMe
for
bringing
former
UMBC
point
guard
K
.
J
.
Maura
to
attend
the
Duke
men’s
basketball
home
game
against
Virginia
.
The
list
goes
on
.
This
editorial
isn’t
a
crusade
against
fun
,
but
rather
a
suggestion
that
students
think
with
more
depth
about
their
energy
and
how
it
is
mismatched
between
minute
issues
and
systemic
issues
,
between
the
self
and
the
greater
fabric
of
society
.
One
only
needs
to
read
a
few
articles
each
semester
to
realize
that
Duke
is
chronically
embroiled
in
scandal
.
The
question
is
how
we
can
form
community
around
social
joys
,
but
also
social
injustice
towards
a
more
just
and
equitable
world
for
all
.
Current
and
some
evergreen
issues
that
desperately
require
more
student
engagement
include
annual
tuition
increases
,
formation
of
a
Hate
and
Bias
policy
,
housekeeping
schedule
and
locations
changes
that
have
now
been
scrapped
,
ICE
raids
breaking
apart
families
in
Durham
,
and
Duke’s
ethically
concerning
investments
.
There’s
a
recurring
lack
of
critical
,
meaningful
political
education
at
Duke
encouraging
the
growth
of
more
rigorous
student
citizens
.
Duke
students
ought
to
reorient
themselves
towards
an
and
rather
than
an
or
mentality
.
You
can
be
bummed
about
the
K
Ville
changes
recognize
the
larger
issues
that
need
student
attention
;
the
two
aren’t
mutually
exclusive
,
but
to
have
the
former
without
the
latter
is
a
troubling
allocation
of
time
and
investment
.
Your
quickly
disintegrating
paper
straw
and
your
overpriced
samosas
are
surely
ills
to
be
rectified
,
but
maybe
also
keep
that
same
energy
to
also
grapple
with
the
timeless
,
overarching
systemic
injustices
that
have
plagued
Duke
for
years
.
Hey
All
,
We
have
had
several
hundred
separate
Duke
students
go
to
the
meme
page
and
ask
if
we
had
headshots
of
the
faculty
who
chose
to
vilify
international
students
.
We
,
the
International
Association
,
were
unable
to
provide
them
with
the
headshots
of
these
faculty
members
.
However
,
we
decided
to
share
with
the
larger
Duke
community
some
thoughts
to
reflect
on
.
There
is
an
implicit
social
contract
between
the
Duke
administration
and
the
international
students
that
their
well
being
is
Duke’s
first
priority
.
Depressingly
,
the
way
this
contract
is
viewed
by
administration
is
akin
to
how
Duke
students
view
bus
schedules
shown
on
the
Rider
app
a
joke
.
While
Duke
is
happy
to
take
the
full
tuition
paid
by
international
students
and
the
groundbreaking
research
and
work
being
done
by
several
of
its
international
academic
community
,
it
is
not
happy
to
allow
them
the
right
to
express
their
national
and
cultural
identity
IN
THE
PRIVACY
OF
A
PERSONAL
CONVERSATION
.
Duke
has
required
all
undergraduate
students
to
complete
foreign
language
studies
,
but
apparently
it
expects
us
to
abandon
all
our
foreign
language
skills
once
we
enter
its
graduate
programs
.
To
faculty
members
,
PLEASE
PLEASE
PLEASE
remember
that
it
is
not
the
job
of
international
students
to
constantly
prove
their
proficiency
in
English
when
they
have
already
done
so
to
gain
admission
into
Duke
.
You
have
no
idea
how
hard
it
is
for
international
students
to
come
to
the
U
.
S
.
and
learn
in
a
non
native
language
.
In
fact
,
you
also
have
no
idea
how
important
it
is
for
them
to
speak
in
their
mother
tongues
as
a
way
to
feel
at
home
,
feel
a
sense
of
belonging
,
and
connect
with
their
cultural
identities
.
When
someone
is
speaking
in
a
foreign
language
,
and
you
feel
like
they
are
talking
about
you
.
It
almost
certainly
is
not
about
you
.
You
are
not
that
interesting
.
As
such
,
we
have
the
upmost
respect
.
.
.
NOT
!
.
.
.
for
the
frustration
you
have
imposed
on
international
students
with
your
email
.
That
being
said
,
we
encourage
you
to
commit
to
being
a
decent
human
being
100
of
the
time
whether
you
are
at
Duke
or
at
any
other
place
in
life
.
Copying
all
administrators
as
a
reminder
given
the
endless
list
of
equity
issues
that
still
need
to
be
addressed
and
resolved
on
this
campus
.
Happy
to
discuss
more
.
Just
stop
by
our
weekly
meetings
on
Mondays
at
7
p
.
m
.
in
the
CMA
Resource
Room
.
Best
,
In
all
seriousness
,
even
though
Dr
.
Neely
has
stepped
down
as
director
of
graduate
studies
,
there
is
still
a
lot
more
work
to
be
done
.
International
Association
has
long
been
trying
to
bring
about
policy
changes
on
campus
for
years
to
improve
the
university’s
support
for
Duke’s
international
community
.
However
,
most
,
if
not
all
our
pleas
have
been
ignored
or
lost
in
bureaucratic
processes
.
The
International
House
,
whose
mission
is
to
provide
educational
programs
,
services
and
advocacy
to
Duke’s
global
community
,
cannot
even
earn
a
proper
space
on
West
or
East
Campus
.
There
,
the
hardworking
staff
have
been
forced
to
do
their
best
from
a
remote
location
where
most
undergraduate
students
cannot
conveniently
access
its
great
support
.
Their
efforts
and
the
value
of
the
existence
of
an
umbrella
institution
for
the
international
community
at
Duke
have
not
been
sufficiently
acknowledged
and
appreciated
by
the
university
,
let
alone
being
adequately
funded
.
So
many
international
students
at
Duke
have
gone
all
four
years
without
ever
even
knowing
that
such
a
resource
exists
.
This
lack
of
visibility
and
accessibility
only
further
contributes
to
the
general
unavailability
of
resources
that
international
students
receive
.
On
many
fronts
,
Duke
is
sending
a
very
clear
message
that
it
does
not
value
its
international
students
as
much
as
it
values
its
domestic
students
.
For
starters
,
Duke
does
not
offer
need
blind
admission
to
international
applicants
,
which
results
in
a
disproportionately
affluent
international
student
body
.
The
message
is
clear
we
only
want
you
if
you
can
pay
.
This
dynamic
generates
a
complicated
relationship
between
low
income
,
international
students
and
the
university
,
and
ultimately
amplifies
alienation
and
ostracization
on
campus
.
Take
O
Week
as
another
example
international
first
years
arrive
onto
an
empty
campus
for
international
orientation
and
are
expected
to
go
through
the
move
in
process
entirely
alone
,
many
arriving
even
without
their
parents
;
for
many
,
this
is
their
first
time
in
the
United
States
.
Contrast
this
to
the
excitement
and
buzz
generated
from
the
move
in
party
when
domestic
students
arrive
on
campus
a
few
days
later
.
The
underwhelming
reception
given
to
internationals
often
exacerbates
the
feelings
of
loneliness
,
anxiety
,
and
isolation
that
any
first
year
student
is
likely
to
experience
.
When
it
comes
to
professional
career
search
,
the
lack
of
structured
curricular
practical
training
programs
,
which
would
allow
international
students
from
all
majors
to
complete
internships
in
a
field
of
their
interest
,
deepens
the
challenges
faced
by
non
STEM
international
students
.
It
forces
many
of
us
nbsp
;
to
make
the
tough
decision
between
paying
3
,
000
for
an
inflexible
writing
course
or
shortening
the
time
they
can
stay
in
the
U
.
S
.
by
participating
in
optional
practical
training
after
graduation
.
As
graduation
season
approaches
,
it
is
also
extremely
disappointing
for
us
to
find
no
commencement
programs
designed
for
international
parents
to
assist
them
with
travelling
logistics
,
campus
navigation
,
and
language
translation
.

Now
that
the
New
York
Times
,
BBC
,
CNN
,
CBS
,
and
the
Washington
Post
have
called
out
Duke
and
its
administration
for
being
irresponsible
at
best
and
xenophobic
at
worst
,
every
administrator
is
jumping
through
hoops
in
order
to
prove
that
we
,
as
a
university
,
are
not
condemnable
.
But
is
this
because
the
university
genuinely
strives
to
protect
its
students
,
or
does
it
only
care
for
its
brand
?
Don't
forget
that
we
have
a
university
campus
in
China
.
We
have
just
one
message
for
Duke
step
up
and
do
better
.
During
an
interview
with
The
Breakfast
Club
,
Senator
Kamala
Harris
confessed
that
she
smoked
weed
in
college
,
and
did
inhale
.
It’s
a
tale
as
old
as
time
Charlamagne
Tha
God
asked
what
music
she
listened
to
,
and
she
responded
definitely
Snoop
.
Tupac
for
sure
.
Controversy
erupted
when
reporters
pointed
out
that
Harris
graduated
from
undergrad
in
86
,
and
both
rappers
didn’t
debut
their
music
until
the
90s
.
Her
critics
have
it
wrong
I
would
know
,
I
smoked
weed
with
her
.
I
remember
it
like
it
was
yesterday
,
give
or
take
35
years
.
The
future
California
senator
pulled
out
a
doobie
after
Intro
to
Poli
Sci
,
cranked
up
the
radio
from
her
backpack
to
Snoop
,
and
asked
me
for
a
lighter
.
My
backpack
those
days
was
home
to
only
my
textbooks
and
a
backup
pair
of
leg
warmers
.
Harris
walked
away
.
But
turning
around
,
my
gawking
stare
directed
at
her
bold
resolve
must
have
sparked
some
curiosity
within
her
.
C’mon
,
kid
,
she
said
,
as
she
signaled
for
me
to
join
her
.
Are
we
smoking
or
what
?
I’ll
admit
I
was
intimidated
;
a
random
girl
from
my
class
was
talking
to
me
,
a
freshman
without
many
friends
.
But
nevertheless
,
Gin
and
Juice
was
on
,
and
so
I
wiped
the
sweat
from
my
palms
off
on
my
hammer
pants
.
We
sat
on
a
bench
by
Randolph
dorm
,
passing
the
blunt
back
and
forth
,
not
caring
who
saw
.
It
was
the
80s
,
and
the
carelessness
of
the
era
seemed
to
follow
us
everywhere
we
went
.
F
ck
the
war
on
drugs
,
she
said
after
a
long
drag
.
F
ck
the
establishment
.
And
f
ck
Reagan
.
If
I
ever
end
up
like
him
Her
voice
trailed
off
,
like
smoke
into
the
crisp
October
air
.
She
laughed
as
I
coughed
;
it
was
my
first
time
smoking
pot
,
and
Harris
knew
.
Am
I
doing
it
right
?
I
managed
to
sputter
.
Take
a
deep
breath
,
and
relax
.
I
did
as
she
said
,
and
as
that
fire
filled
my
lungs
,
I
felt
my
anxious
body
finally
relax
.
The
two
of
us
became
fast
friends
.
We
settled
our
munchies
at
Marketplace
,
feasting
on
pizza
and
frozen
yogurt
.
Our
conversation
was
boundless
,
a
medium
for
escaping
the
confines
of
time
and
space
classes
,
class
,
our
favorite
Tupac
songs
.
Nothing
was
off
limits
.
We
dreamed
about
the
future
.
I
wanted
to
be
a
writer
,
sharing
my
experiences
with
the
world
.
And
Kamala
?
With
a
gleam
in
her
eye
,
she
shared
that
she
just
wanted
to
make
something
of
herself
.
Maybe
politics
,
maybe
academia
.
You
could
be
President
one
day
,
I
told
her
,
inspired
by
this
shared
vision
of
the
future
I
was
now
privy
to
.
Maybe
,
she
said
,
shaking
her
head
.
Our
imaginative
moment
passed
.
You
won’t
believe
what
I
have
in
my
room
,
she
whispered
across
the
booth
,
giggling
as
we
came
down
from
our
high
.
I
wouldn’t
have
believed
it
the
desk
drawers
of
her
Alspaugh
single
were
filled
to
the
brim
with
weed
infused
edibles
.
Though
my
first
impulse
was
to
ask
,
nbsp
;
you
can
eat
pot
?
I
managed
to
slip
a
quick
far
out
,
trying
to
keep
my
cool
.
And
a
journey
I
did
take
I
danced
in
a
cage
.
I
puked
in
the
bathroom
.
I
ate
my
first
Waffle
House
.
All
with
my
new
friend
,
Kamala
.
Anyways
,
the
rest
is
history
.
We
remained
friendly
for
the
rest
of
our
time
together
at
Duke
.
Kamala
graduated
,
took
a
job
as
California’s
Attorney
General
,
and
is
now
running
for
President
of
the
United
States
.
I’m
still
at
Duke
,
writing
columns
for
the
Chronicle
,
and
smoking
dope
with
any
Presidential
hopeful
that
comes
my
way
.
Harris
and
I
grew
apart
,
keeping
in
touch
through
family
holiday
cards
and
the
occasional
Facebook
update
that
rekindles
a
familiar
flame
of
nostalgia
.
How
do
I
explain
the
anachronisms
of
undergrad
?
The
Mandela
effect
.
A
mixtape
that
leaked
to
radio
stations
.
I
don’t
know
it
was
the
80s
,
and
anything
was
possible
.
They
say
that
pot
impairs
memory
,
but
I
never
did
forget
that
fateful
Wednesday
afternoon
right
as
the
season
was
changing
.
The
weed
was
strong
,
the
hip
hop
stronger
,
and
I
well
,
I
finally
felt
like
I
belonged
.
We
are
Jews
members
of
synagogues
,
Jewish
Life
at
Duke
attendees
and
secular
folks
alike
and
many
of
us
are
members
of
the
Duke
community
.
We
are
writing
to
honor
and
support
the
Editorial
Board
of
The
Chronicle
.
We
admire
the
Chronicle
Editorial
Board’s
principled
stance
in
support
of
Representative
Ilhan
Omar
and
their
brilliant
call
for
international
solidarity
against
state
violence
.
As
Jews
,
we
join
with
others
committed
to
justice
in
our
support
of
Palestinian
liberation
.
And
we
are
horrified
at
the
Islamophobic
and
anti
Black
tenor
of
the
accusations
against
Representative
Omar
.
We
want
to
work
to
create
a
Duke
community
that
is
safe
and
affirming
for
Black
students
and
workers
,
Jewish
students
and
workers
,
immigrant
and
international
students
and
workers
,
Palestinian
students
and
workers
,
and
queer
students
and
workers
.
To
do
that
,
we
have
to
understand
the
roots
of
anti
Semitism
in
white
supremacy
,
and
commit
to
dismantling
racism
alongside
Islamophobia
and
anti
Semitism
.
Many
of
our
family
and
friends
in
the
Jewish
community
would
like
to
see
any
criticism
of
Israel
as
a
criticism
of
all
Jewish
people
,
but
this
is
simply
not
true
,
and
the
Chronicle’s
measured
support
for
Representative
Omar
is
not
anti
Semitic
.
In
the
past
few
years
,
we
have
heard
a
proliferation
of
anti
Semitic
conspiracy
theories
from
Donald
Trump
and
his
supporters
including
fantasies
that
white
Jews
secretly
control
everything
from
global
finance
and
immigration
policy
to
Black
Lives
Matter
and
other
people
of
color
led
social
movements
.
And
we
have
seen
violent
manifestations
of
anti
Semitism
from
Pittsburgh
to
Charlottesville
,
and
closer
to
home
,
a
bright
red
swastika
painted
over
the
Tree
of
Life
memorial
at
East
Campus
.
Yet
people
across
the
political
spectrum
must
continue
to
learn
about
anti
Semitism
.
Jews
for
Racial
and
Economic
Justice
JFREJ
,
a
multiracial
organization
based
in
New
York
City
,
offers
a
resource
entitled
Understanding
Antisemitism
.
According
to
JFREJ
,
Antisemitism
is
the
form
of
ideological
oppression
that
targets
Jews
.
In
Europe
and
the
United
States
it
has
functioned
to
protect
the
prevailing
economic
system
and
the
almost
exclusively
Christian
ruling
class
by
diverting
blame
for
hardship
onto
Jews
.
Anti
Semitism
bolsters
white
supremacy
because
it
masks
the
fact
that
those
in
power
are
actually
responsible
for
economic
crises
,
and
delegitimizes
social
movements
led
by
people
of
color
and
working
people
.
We
remain
committed
to
organizing
against
anti
Semitism
as
part
of
all
of
our
social
movements
.
Criticizing
Israel
or
Zionism
is
not
anti
Semitic
.
In
fact
,
for
many
of
us
,
it’s
a
manifestation
of
our
Jewish
values
.
Jewish
Voice
for
Peace’s
recent
statement
on
Zionism
explains
,
While
it
had
many
strains
historically
,
the
Zionism
that
took
hold
and
stands
today
is
a
settler
colonial
movement
,
establishing
an
apartheid
state
where
Jews
have
more
rights
than
others
.
For
us
,
rejecting
Zionism
means
choosing
solidarity
and
collective
liberation
.
For
us
,
rejecting
Zionism
means
opposing
ethno
nationalism
,
and
opposing
a
system
of
government
that
grants
people
different
rights
based
on
race
or
religion
.
As
Representative
Omar
pointed
out
,
it’s
simply
a
fact
that
AIPAC
along
with
a
coalition
of
other
pro
Israel
U
.
S
.
based
organizations
works
to
organize
continued
Congressional
support
for
38
billion
of
U
.
S
.
military
aid
to
Israel
.
That’s
38
billion
that
should
be
used
for
housing
,
education
and
healthcare
here
in
the
U
.
S
.
,
not
on
violence
abroad
.
Nearly
all
of
us
have
been
recruited
to
attend
at
least
one
all
expenses
paid
trip
to
Israel
designed
to
generate
sympathy
and
support
for
the
country
.
Law
students
,
leaders
of
College
Republicans
and
Democrats
,
young
Jews
,
police
chiefs
,
ICE
agents
and
elected
officials
are
only
some
of
the
groups
offered
such
trips
.
It’s
also
vital
to
note
that
the
largest
pro
Israel
advocacy
and
lobbying
organization
in
this
country
is
actually
Christians
United
for
Israel
CUFI
.
CUFI
is
bolstered
by
evangelical
Christians
who
believe
particular
end
of
times
prophecies
which
see
Jewish
possession
of
the
Holy
Land
as
a
prerequisite
for
the
Rapture
which
,
it
turns
out
,
is
not
a
favorable
event
for
the
Jews
.
Although
there
have
long
been
Americans
speaking
out
against
Israeli
apartheid
,
we
have
seen
that
Black
people
are
the
ones
who
face
the
harshest
political
consequences
for
supporting
Palestinian
human
rights
.
Nonetheless
,
there
is
a
strong
tradition
of
Black
Palestinian
solidarity
in
the
South
that
continues
today
,
supported
by
Black
Muslims
,
Black
Christians
and
Black
Jews
alike
.
Here
in
Durham
,
we
were
so
proud
of
the
Demilitarize
!
Durham2Palestine
coalition
,
a
coalition
of
organizations
including
our
chapter
,
as
well
as
BYP100
Durham
Chapter
and
Duke
Students
for
Justice
in
Palestine
,
which
made
Durham
the
first
city
to
denounce
and
halt
its
police
training
with
the
Israeli
military
.
We
see
the
Chronicle’s
Editorial
Board
as
part
of
this
proud
legacy
of
internationalism
in
the
South
.
We
honor
their
call
to
take
part
in
rigorous
and
unyielding
international
solidarity
,
from
Ferguson
to
Gaza
.
’
And
we
support
Ilhan
Omar
.
As
Duke
students
gear
up
for
their
first
pregame
this
weekend
,
they
may
or
may
not
recall
that
Malia
Obama
made
headlines
in
the
Daily
Mail
this
week
.
On
Sunday
,
the
20
year
old
was
spotted
sipping
on
an
80
bottle
of
rosé
with
friends
in
Miami
Beach
,
Florida
.
This
seemingly
trivial
news
story
ignited
a
slew
of
all
too
familiar
criticism
of
Malia
and
the
Obamas
from
various
corners
of
social
media
.
In
the
tradition
of
bashing
the
wild
and
unruly
behavior
of
political
progenies
,
conservative
commentators
heavily
criticized
Malia’s
conduct
.
This
proverbial
finger
shaking
by
the
Daily
Mail
was
by
no
means
isolated
.
Quickly
following
Malia’s
under
age
drinking
scandal
,
the
Daily
Mail
reported
on
a
secret
Facebook
page
detailing
just
how
much
the
former
first
daughter
hates
her
father’s
predecessor
.
But
the
Daily
Mail’s
obsession
as
well
as
that
of
many
other
media
outlets
with
the
leisure
activities
of
Malia
Obama
runs
far
deeper
than
this
most
recent
occurrence
.
Just
last
August
,
the
Daily
Mail
detailed
their
sightings
of
the
First
Daughter
smoking
an
e
cigarette
and
walking
with
her
then
boyfriend
in
London
.
This
was
further
preceded
by
TMZ
reports
of
Malia
twerking
and
smoking
marijuana
at
Lollapalooza
2017
.
Clearly
,
the
former
first
daughter
is
no
stranger
to
the
watchful
eye
of
the
media
.
Malia’s
behavior
in
many
ways
is
typical
of
many
fun
loving
college
students
,
yet
instances
of
her
scandalous
underage
drinking
and
appearances
at
music
festivals
still
draw
the
ire
of
critics
seemingly
obsessed
with
delegitimizing
the
Obamas
.
Part
of
this
fascination
can
be
credited
to
the
long
history
of
surveillance
by
mainstream
news
sources
of
first
children
.
Chelsea
Clinton
was
the
subject
of
much
news
coverage
after
her
father’s
sex
scandal
with
Monica
Lewinsky
.
This
continued
into
her
college
days
as
both
Clinton’s
personal
life
and
her
looks
drew
attention
from
news
outlets
and
politicians
,
alike
.
The
late
Senator
John
McCain
,
for
instance
,
allegedly
asked
,
Why
is
Chelsea
Clinton
so
ugly
?
at
a
1998
GOP
fundraiser
.
Similarly
,
Donald
Trump’s
youngest
son
,
Barron
Trump
became
the
subject
of
intense
discussion
when
speculation
of
Barron
having
autism
gained
traction
on
Twitter
prior
to
his
father’s
inauguration
.
At
the
time
,
Barron
was
only
10
years
old
,
and
already
in
the
media
spotlight
.
Another
component
to
the
Daily
Mail’s
consistent
coverage
of
Malia
Obama
is
that
it
simply
follows
the
trend
of
news
coverage
on
the
Obamas
saw
during
the
former
president’s
time
in
office
.
By
virtue
of
being
related
to
the
first
non
white
president
,
the
former
first
family
often
received
unsolicited
commentary
on
their
looks
,
outfit
choices
and
personal
lives
.
Michelle
Obama
,
a
Harvard
educated
attorney
in
her
own
right
,
was
accused
of
secretly
being
male
by
far
right
conspiracy
theorist
,
Alex
Jones
,
publicly
referred
to
as
an
ape
in
heels
by
a
West
Virginian
county
employee
and
lambasted
in
an
Al
Shapiro
interview
for
not
looking
like
a
first
lady
after
revealing
well
toned
arms
in
a
sleeveless
dress
for
her
official
White
House
portrait
.
Both
the
existence
and
severity
of
these
qualms
,
amongst
others
,
carry
racial
overtones
that
support
the
idea
that
black
women
are
disrespected
far
more
than
their
non
black
female
peers
.
Criticisms
of
Malia
in
particular
are
reminiscent
of
stereotypical
media
depictions
of
young
black
women
as
being
immoral
,
irresponsible
and
ghetto
in
comparison
to
their
well
behaved
white
counterparts
.
With
that
being
said
,
most
of
the
feedback
on
the
Daily
Mail’s
exposé’
favored
the
young
Obama
.
But
the
point
still
remains
despite
her
celebrity
,
Malia
Obama
is
not
unlike
any
student
here
on
campus
.
Here
at
Duke
,
we
are
by
no
means
strangers
to
underage
drinking
,
partying
,
or
any
of
the
other
things
that
go
along
with
being
college
aged
.
As
previously
published
in
the
Chronicle
,
more
than
70
percent
of
Duke
students
self
reported
drinking
.
Even
anecdotally
,
questions
like
,
who’s
rolling
Shoots
?
and
where’s
the
pregame
?
echo
down
halls
on
Saturday
nights
including
on
East
campus
,
despite
its
designation
as
dry
.
In
their
time
at
Duke
,
many
students
will
have
engaged
in
activities
they
probably
would
not
want
to
see
trending
on
Twitter
the
next
morning
.
It
is
not
hard
to
imagine
that
despite
being
the
daughter
of
a
former
U
.
S
.
president
,
and
Malia
Obama
is
no
different
.
While
chugging
a
handle
of
Aristocrat
on
a
Saturday
night
,
it
is
easy
to
feel
somewhat
grateful
that
,
unlike
Malia
Obama
,
for
the
ordinary
Duke
student
,
documentation
of
their
Devines
bathroom
blackout
will
most
likely
be
limited
to
Snapchats
among
class
friends
,
and
not
the
Daily
Mail
.
Every
February
,
students
huddle
around
their
laptops
to
vote
or
rather
rank
their
choice
for
Young
Trustee
.
During
the
weeks
leading
up
to
election
,
student
campaigns
for
finalists
,
rivaling
the
funding
and
intensity
of
local
political
elections
,
heat
up
as
various
candidates
seek
endorsements
and
support
from
student
organizations
on
campus
.
This
year
,
as
always
,
four
prominent
members
of
the
undergraduate
community
at
Duke
stand
for
election
in
the
race
for
Young
Trustee
.
They
are
Luke
Farrell
,
Archana
Ahlawat
,
Brian
Buhr
and
Trey
Walk
.
Like
in
the
past
,
all
four
candidates
are
running
on
overly
ambitious
agendas
that
most
likely
will
not
make
a
significant
impact
on
a
Board
of
Trustees
dominated
by
wealthy
,
out
of
touch
white
men
and
women
.
Aside
from
this
disenchantment
,
however
,
we
strongly
encourage
undergraduates
to
rank
Trey
Walk
first
for
Young
Trustee
,
this
week
.
In
his
interview
with
the
Chronicle’s
independent
editorial
board
,
Luke
heavily
emphasized
his
past
and
present
roles
in
a
wide
variety
of
governing
institutions
within
the
University
as
a
major
factor
in
why
he
is
qualified
to
serve
as
Young
Trustee
.
Farrell
certainly
boasts
a
stellar
resume
as
former
chair
of
the
Student
Organization
Financing
Committee
,
as
well
as
present
membership
on
the
Presidential
Advisory
Committee
on
Investment
and
Responsibility
and
on
the
Board
of
Trustees’
business
and
finance
committee
.
Nonetheless
,
the
editorial
board
found
some
of
his
agenda
items
in
his
campaign
,
such
as
advocating
for
a
drastic
expansion
of
financial
aid
,
overly
ambitious
,
considering
the
extreme
limitations
of
the
role
in
affecting
genuine
,
significant
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
University
.
Likewise
,
Brian
highlighted
his
experiences
as
president
of
Duke
University
Union
,
Project
Build
,
the
Women’s
Center
and
the
Board
of
Trustees
external
engagement
committee
as
reasons
why
he
would
make
an
effective
Young
Trustee
.
He
discussed
how
he
envisioned
the
role
of
Young
Trustee
as
being
someone
who
can
color
the
perspectives
of
data
obsessed
trustees
with
the
so
called
humanity
of
the
campus
community
.
However
,
the
editorial
board
found
his
position
on
selective
living
at
Duke
,
particularly
as
a
current
member
of
Pi
Kappa
Phi
fraternity
somewhat
problematic
.
Perhaps
,
as
Buhr
admits
,
it
is
true
that
by
virtue
of
being
an
institution
seeped
in
bourgeois
culture
,
selective
living
will
always
exist
at
Duke
.
Nonetheless
,
the
wide
scale
existence
of
an
undergraduate
social
experience
that
systematically
excludes
less
privileged
students
is
still
inherently
antithetical
to
the
mission
of
a
supposedly
diverse
,
inclusive
university
.
Archana
Ahlawat
,
a
Microsoft
bound
computer
science
major
and
the
only
female
candidate
running
this
year
,
underlined
her
leadership
roles
in
Duke
Conversations
,
Business
Oriented
Women
BOW
and
Duke
Women
in
Technology
as
experiences
that
make
her
a
strong
candidate
for
Young
Trustee
.
In
particular
,
Archana
discussed
her
background
as
a
minority
,
female
identifying
student
in
a
variety
of
homogenous
,
white
male
dominated
industries
like
business
and
technology
,
and
her
role
in
supposedly
diversifying
BOW
through
a
diversity
amp
;
inclusivity
committee
.
Nevertheless
,
the
editorial
board
found
her
platform
to
be
somewhat
vague
and
her
campus
leadership
very
niche
in
comparison
to
other
candidates
who
boast
experiences
that
are
more
inclusive
.
Finally
,
Trey
discussed
his
heavy
involvement
in
student
activism
with
groups
like
People’s
State
of
the
University
PSOTU
and
the
Ban
the
Box
movement
as
experiences
that
make
him
a
worthy
candidate
for
Young
Trustee
.
By
far
the
most
anti
establishment
candidate
,
as
someone
who
made
headlines
last
year
with
PSOTU
storming
Page
during
Price’s
alumni
weekend
speech
,
Walk
will
bring
a
fresh
perspective
to
the
Board
.
Moreover
,
in
explaining
his
status
as
an
anti
establishment
candidate
for
the
very
establishment
institution
that
is
the
Board
of
Trustees
,
Trey
discussed
his
realistic
expectations
in
confronting
conservative
,
stalwart
leadership
.
Nonetheless
,
drawing
upon
his
past
activist
experiences
,
he
vows
to
advocate
for
certain
issues
,
like
racial
justice
and
mental
health
,
that
are
representative
of
the
interests
of
Duke’s
underrepresented
.
This
week
,
we
strongly
encourage
the
undergraduate
student
body
to
rank
Trey
Walk
first
when
voting
for
Young
Trustee
.
In
serving
a
short
,
three
year
tenure
on
the
Board
of
Trustees
,
it
is
unlikely
that
a
Young
Trustee
will
able
to
effect
meaningful
change
regardless
of
their
optimistic
campaign
promises
.
In
fact
,
the
role
is
officially
as
defined
as
being
a
fiduciary
of
the
university
rather
than
an
actual
student
representative
.
Despite
these
limitations
,
however
,
having
Trey
,
someone
who
has
risked
disciplinary
action
in
advocating
for
the
rights
of
students
and
workers
alike
,
on
a
board
of
disconnected
elites
will
hopefully
signal
an
ever
so
tiny
wave
of
change
here
at
dear
old
Duke
.
The
proposed
light
rail
would
have
a
stop

along
Lasalle
Street
and

Erwin
Road
near

Hospital
.
To
the
Editors
I
grew
up
in
Durham
and
watched
the
downtown
die
in
the
nbsp
;
70s
as
middle
class
residents
and
shops
fled
to
the
outer
neighborhoods
.
nbsp
;
In
the
early
80s
I
attended
Duke
at
a
nbsp
;
time
when
the
university
nbsp
;
pulled
inward
,
hugged
students
close
,
and
walled
itself
off
from
the
nbsp
;
struggling
city
.
In
recent
years
,
with
an
expanding
economy
,
Duke
has
done
nbsp
;
a
nbsp
;
good
job
of
anchoring
revitalization
in
Durham
.
Recruiting
students
nbsp
;
and
faculty
has
never
been
easier
.
Today
,
I’m
living
a
dream
of
investing
nbsp
;
in
downtown’s
alternative
art
nbsp
;
scene
.
The
university
is
positioned
to
allow
or
block
light
rail
access
to
nbsp
;
the
hospital
and
to
downtown
.
Progress
will
require
a
right
of
way

donation
on
Erwin
Road
,
a
public

road
,
and
sharing
Duke’s

at

corner
of

Duke
needs
to
avoid
the
tempting
nbsp

lethargy
of
a
nonprofit
,
endowed
landowner
,
sitting
on
linchpin

property
.
As
most
people
on
campus
have
probably
heard
,
Megan
Neely
,
previously
the
director
of
graduate
studies
for
the
Master
of
Biostatistics
program
,
stepped
down
from
that
position
after
emails
sent
by
her
to
students
in
the
program
went
public
.
In
the
emails
,
Neely
,
at
the
behest
of
two
as
of
yet
unnamed
professors
in
the
department
,
instructs
students
to
commit
to
speaking
English
while
in
departmental
spaces
.
I
do
not
condone
the
statements
Neely
made
in
the
email
.
They
were
rooted
in
racist
and
xenophobic
ideas
about
what
types
of
speech
are
permitted
in
our
university
spaces
.
They
were
insensitive
,
poorly
worded
,
and
alienating
to
an
already
heavily
marginalized
group
on
campus
.
They
were
not
only
damaging
themselves
,
but
also
a
reflection
of
a
harmful
Western
centric
ideology
that
is
alive
and
well
on
our
campus
,
in
our
country
,
and
around
the
world
.
But
while
I
am
concerned
about
this
ideology
,
as
a
student
and
member
of
the
university
,
I
am
also
concerned
by
how
we
react
to
situations
like
this
one
.
We
have
reached
a
point
in
our
campus
discourse
where
it
has
become
increasingly
difficult
to
critique
the
administration
without
specifically
advocating
for
the
downfall
of
individuals
and
increasingly
difficult
to
critique
student
response
without
being
immediately
branded
a
racist
sympathizer
.
Make
no
mistake
Neely’s
actions
were
problematic
,
but
they
were
also
complex
.
Neely
was
acting
at
the
direction
of
at
least
two
faculty
members
who
likely
have
no
small
amount
of
power
within
her
former
department
.
These
professors’
threats
to
purposefully
endanger
students’
future
employment
prospects
based
on
the
language
they
choose
to
speak
is
a
clear
example
of
racism
.
But
it
is
also
inarguable
that
most
employers
implicitly
demand
good
to
excellent
English
in
their
hiring
process
.
The
fact
is
,
our
world
is
rife
with
non
purposeful
racial
and
cultural
bias
as
well
as
explicit
racism
,
especially
in
terms
of
employment
.
Is
it
really
so
far
fetched
to
argue
that
it
was
precisely
Neely’s
job
to
prepare
her
graduate
students
for
this
terrible
but
unavoidable
social
reality
?
No
one
should
have
to
accede
to
oppressive
power
structures
.
But
to
ignore
these
structures
,
especially
as
one
enters
the
broader
world
,
is
naiveté
.
There
are
other
complications
.
In
her
February
2018
email
,
Neely
explicitly
presents
her
instructions
as
a
messenger
and
not
a
commanding
authority
her
words
are
comments
she’s
received
from
other
department
members
;
she
is
providing
a
different
viewpoint
.
Most
tellingly
,
the
most
recent
report
was
from
the
chair
of
the
department
.
A
reading
of
the
original
email
makes
it
obvious
that
to
a
large
extent
,
Neely
was
acting
as
an
intermediary
.
In
other
words
,
she
was
just
the
face
of
a
larger
power
structure
.
Again
,
I
am
not
trying
to
argue
that
Neely
was
correct
in
her
actions
.
She
wrote
and
signed
the
email
,
and
she
is
responsible
for
its
contents
.
I
acknowledge
that
a
common
tactic
used
by
those
in
power
in
situations
like
this
is
to
throw
up
a
confetti
of
excuses
and
convoluted
logic
that
may
seem
to
resemble
what
I’ve
written
in
the
previous
paragraphs
.
I
promise
you
that
I
am
writing
this
column
in
good
faith
.
I
am
not
trying
to
muddy
the
waters
.
But
I
challenge
anyone
to
take
a
hard
look
at
this
sprawling
collision
of
cultures
,
social
norms
,
power
dynamics
,
and
internal
politics
within
a
high
pressure
biostatistics
department
,
and
tell
me
that
the
situation
is
as
simple
as
Megan
Neely
being
a
racist
who
should
be
tossed
out
of
the
university
.
I
am
not
trying
to
muddy
the
waters
;
I
am
trying
to
point
out
that
the
waters
muddy
.
If
we’re
willing
to
acknowledge
that
the
problem
is
complex
,
then
we
must
also
be
willing
to
acknowledge
that
the
solution
may
also
be
complex
.
But
,
at
least
in
my
experience
,
that
acknowledgement
was
not
made
.
Instead
,
the
vast
majority
of
students
overheard
a
Neely
is
racist
joke
,
threw
a
couple
likes
on
the
meme
page
,
decided
Neely
was
a
racist
in
the
simplest
terms
,
accepted
her
resignation
with
a
grin
,
and
then
prepared
to
move
on
to
the
next
outrage
.
Anyone
want
to
bet
it
involves
Moneta
?
This
pattern
of
student
engagement
in
the
affairs
of
our
university
is
shallow
,
rooted
in
anger
,
and
most
importantly
,
not
productive
in
fighting
oppressive
ideologies
.
It
is
also
a
pattern
I’m
personally
familiar
with
.
I
grew
up
as
a
secular
South
Indian
boy
in
Marietta
,
Georgia
.
I
know
firsthand
what
it
is
like
to
exist
in
an
environment
that
is
opposed
to
one’s
identity
.
I
know
firsthand
how
easy
it
is
to
react
to
that
environment
with
jokes
,
anger
,
and
bitter
resentment
of
those
in
power
.
I
don’t
bring
up
these
facts
to
garner
sympathy
,
or
to
protect
myself
from
criticism
with
pathos
.
I
bring
them
up
because
they
taught
me
something
important
the
ultimate
enemy
will
never
be
a
person
,
but
an
ideology
.
And
ideologies
aren’t
fought
with
firings
and
scapegoats
they’re
fought
with
discourse
.
They’re
fought
with
education
.
And
they’re
fought
by
questioning
the
roots
of
racism
in
our
society
.
These
things
are
hard
.
Hard
to
make
actionable
and
hard
to
measure
in
terms
of
efficacy
.
They
are
not
nearly
as
satisfying
as
a
resignation
.
But
they
do
have
the
advantage
of
actually
addressing
the
problem
,
instead
of
putting
an
administrative
band
aid
over
it
.

Ultimately
,
the
question
of
how
we
as
a
campus
react
to
issues
like
this
is
a
complex
one
.
I
believe
that
as
a
community
of
diverse
,
incisive
individuals
,
there
are
a
variety
of
valid
solutions
that
could
be
advocated
for
in
reaction
to
this
situation
.
Personally
,
I
believe
that
Neely’s
resignation
from
the
director
position
did
more
harm
than
good
.
It
allowed
many
on
campus
an
easy
outlet
for
their
anger
,
at
the
direct
expense
of
addressing
the
full
complexity
of
the
situation
.
I’m
sure
many
will
have
well
thought
out
critical
responses
to
that
belief
and
this
column
.
So
don't
limit
your
responses
to
these
issues
to
a
scroll
through
the
meme
page
or
an
angry
Facebook
comment
.
Talk
about
them
in
their
full
complexity
.
Write
about
them
in
their
full
complexity
.
And
please
,
feel
free
to
do
it
all
in
Mandarin
.
An
inscrutable
mass
of
p
froshes
descended
upon
Duke’s
campus
several
weekends
ago
for
the
early
decision
Blue
Devil
Days
.
Congregating
on
the
Bryan
Center
Plaza
,
the
students
buzzed
with
excitement
for
what
will
be
their
home
for
the
next
four
years
.
While
I
watched
their
elation
unfold
,
a
sense
of
nostalgia
stirred
within
me
.
I
grasped
that
I
was
not
so
wholly
removed
from
them
,
as
it
was
all
but
ten
months
ago
that
I
replied
with
an
emphatic
Yes
!
to
Duke’s
offer
of
admission
.
But
as
they
anxiously
await
their
journeys
in
this
gothic
wonderland
,
it’s
hard
to
pinpoint
the
collective
experience
the
class
of
2023
envisions
for
themselves
.
Although
I
hesitate
to
posit
too
broadly
,
I
believe
it’s
important
to
mold
these
perceptions
early
on
.
As
soon
as
possible
,
actually
.
Upon
publishing
my
last
column
,
little
did
I
know
that
my
exploration
of
Duke’s
pre
professionalism
epidemic
would
catapult
me
into
a
campaign
of
liberal
arts
advocacy
.
As
I
have
described
at
length
,
there
are
broader
and
more
looming
factors
that
underlie
preserving
the
integrity
of
higher
education
as
a
whole
.
The
discussion
of
pre
professionalism
is
timely
.
On
February
12th
,
Vice
Provost
of
Undergraduate
Education
Gary
Bennett
spoke
before
Duke
Student
Government
Senate
,
extolling
the
purpose
of
a
liberal
arts
education
and
how
students
can
best
optimize
the
limitless
academic
configurations
available
at
Duke
.
And
the
very
next
day
,
the
Arts
and
Sciences
Council
convened
on
the
topic
Student
Pathways
,
Diverging
Enrollments
,
and
the
Liberal
Arts
.
While
engagement
in
these
dialogues
is
much
needed
,
it’s
time
to
start
implementing
solutions
.
Intent
without
action
is
futile
.
The
mindset
of
the
class
of
2023
is
deterministic
of
one
fourth
of
the
undergraduate
student
body
.
After
wishing
the
class
of
2019
bon
voyage
,
we
will
welcome
approximately
1
,
700
new
students
this
coming
fall
.
The
cycle
repeats
itself
without
pause
,
perpetually
circling
back
to
the
formative
first
year
experience
.
Although
eager
and
anticipating
,
the
p
froshes
already
come
to
Duke
with
individualized
schemas
about
the
institution
.
As
they
carry
these
perceptions
with
them
,
it
is
important
to
ask
How
will
their
ideas
shift
during
the
first
several
weeks
and
how
will
these
changes
impact
how
they
acclimate
to
campus
?
Campus
culture
is
self
sustaining
.
And
to
an
extent
,
the
pace
of
student
life
at
Duke
is
set
during
O
week
.
Engulfed
in
a
vortex
of
interaction
and
exploration
,
jittery
first
years
quickly
get
ensnared
in
the
chaos
of
college
life
.
With
proper
intervention
,
it
is
possible
to
shape
these
determining
views
.
There
is
inherent
value
in
jumpstarting
these
conversations
earlier
on
;
that
is
,
before
the
first
years
feel
the
inescapable
pull
of
conformity
.
But
the
goal
that
underlies
any
future
initiative
is
to
ensure
that
all
students
are
informed
about
resources
throughout
their
time
at
Duke
.
Expansion
of
pre
Orientation
programs
could
be
a
start
,
offering
students
an
intimate
and
immersive
glimpse
to
Duke
while
building
a
sense
of
community
before
the
tumult
of
O
week
.
But
it’s
not
enough
.
The
juxtaposition
of
limited
resources
against
the
vast
student
need
is
difficult
to
reconcile
.
And
it’s
unlikely
that
Duke
would
be
willing
to
finance
a
meaningful
pre
Orientation
experience
for
all
1
,
700
of
its
incoming
first
years
.
So
while
students
should
have
more
ease
in
the
transition
,
a
variety
of
factors
inevitably
disrupt
a
first
year’s
ideal
exposition
to
college
.
But
not
all
hope
is
lost
.
Last
semester
,
I
stumbled
into
the
Academic
Advising
Center
disoriented
and
in
disarray
from
O
week
.
Precariously
hunched
over
from
my
nearly
40
pound
backpack
while
clutching
a
mountain
of
pamphlets
and
information
sheets
,
I
undoubtedly
fit
the
classic
trope
of
a
confused
first
year
.
On
a
whim
,
I
had
scheduled
an
appointment
with
a
Director
of
Academic
Engagement
DAE
,
hoping
to
check
another
box
on
my
student
network
.
I
signed
up
for
a
consultation
with
Dr
.
Jules
Odendahl
James
,
DAE
for
the
Humanities
.
Our
conversation
transcended
niceties
and
empty
advice
.
Instead
we
discussed
finding
intentionality
in
campus
involvement
and
research
.
She
nudged
an
enormous
packet
before
me
,
filled
with
scholarship
,
fellowship
,
study
abroad
,
co
curricular
and
interdisciplinary
research
opportunities
.
Noticing
my
complete
bewilderment
,
she
said
with
a
smile
,
You’ll
get
to
know
some
of
these
things
over
the
years
.
Since
that
initial
conversation
,
I
have
met
with
two
other
DAEs
,
sought
out
resources
from
the
Wellness
Center
,
scheduled
weekly
consultations
with
my
advisor
from
the
Academic
Resources
Center
,
and
learned
of
a
myriad
of
other
places
on
campus
,
such
as
the
Career
Center
,
to
seek
help
,
guidance
and
affirmation
.
This
is
the
kind
of
network
that
I
envision
for
every
first
year
a
nexus
of
mentors
to
cultivate
self
confidence
and
a
sense
of
direction
.
However
,
when
contemplating
Duke’s
sprawling
institutional
reach
,
I’ve
come
to
realize
just
how
decentralized
access
to
resources
is
.
Accessibility
is
curated
through
niches
,
with
the
entryways
embedded
in
Duke’s
complex
constellation
of
centers
and
departments
.
As
a
first
year
struggling
to
navigate
the
maze
of
West
campus
alone
,
maneuvering
these
institutional
networks
is
outright
intimidating
.
For
students
already
pressured
to
adapt
and
overcome
obstacles
in
Duke’s
frenzied
campus
culture
,
expediency
tends
to
supercede
the
effort
it
takes
to
kindle
exploration
.
It
takes
personal
responsibility
and
a
sense
of
accountability
for
your
own
future
;
it
takes
a
willingness
to
liberate
yourself
from
inhibition
and
learn
to
take
risks
.
But
before
this
can
happen
,
Duke
needs
to
work
to
untangle
the
twisted
wires
so
that
first
years
don’t
feel
like
they
need
an
advisor
for
advising
.
If
all
goes
as
planned
,
the
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
DOLRT
is
set
to
begin
construction
in
2020
and
commence
operations
between
Chapel
Hill
and
Durham
in
2028
.
When
it
will
tentatively
open
,
nearly
ten
years
from
now
,
the
system
will
connect
UNC
Chapel
Hill
,
Duke
,
downtown
Durham
and
NCCU
through
an
18
mile
long
light
rail
in
about
45
minutes
.
At
the
moment
,
Duke
has
withheld
support
and
land
donations
to
the
project
,
citing
specific
grievances
related
to
the
light
rail’s
potential
effect
on
operations
on
activities
at
the
medical
campus
and
traffic
off
of
Erwin
Road
.
Various
stakeholders
in
the
light
rail
debate
community
activists
,
alumni
,
environmental
groups
,
etc
.
have
written
in
support
of
the
light
rail
to
President
Price
,
urging
him
to
sign
onto
GoTriangle’s
funding
application
to
the
Federal
Transit
Administration
FTA
before
the
April
deadline
.
As
Price
and
the
powers
that
may
be
deliberate
on
whether
or
not
to
support
the
light
rail
,
the
topic
itself
deserves
a
critical
editorial
examination
.
Rather
than
being
a
cut
and
dry
issue
as
if
the
system
could
conceivably
cure
all
of
Durham’s
municipal
problems
in
the
flip
of
a
rail
switch
the
light
rail
represents
a
controversial
urban
renewal
project
that
the
University
community
should
deservedly
be
cautious
in
considering
.
Arguably
one
of
the
fastest
growing
metropolitan
regions
in
the
country
,
the
Triangle
boasts
a
notoriously
car
dependent
infrastructure
spread
across
low
density
communities
in
three
major
urban
centers
Raleigh
,
Durham
and
Chapel
Hill
.
Along
with
significant
population
and
economic
growth
,
the
resurgence
of
the
Triangle
region
over
the
past
few
decades
has
also
resulted
in
greater
traffic
gridlock
,
less
affordable
housing
,
greater
environmental
pollution
and
other
major
social
problems
that
plague
the
region
at
the
end
of
the
2010s
.
In
discussion
for
over
twenty
years
,
a
light
rail
connecting
all
the
major
vertices
of
the
Triangle
seemingly
represents
a
public
transit
oriented
solution
to
such
problems
,
providing
an
affordable
,
efficient
and
environmentally
sustainable
method
of
traversing
the
region’s
low
density
urban
sprawl
.
Nonetheless
,
the
light
rail
has
also
received
criticism
from
its
opponents
,
who
cite
the
high
public
costs
,
low
ridership
and
potential
gentrification
that
could
result
from
the
system’s
construction
.
Light
rail
systems
have
emerged
in
the
past
decade
as
popular
,
and
controversial
,
additions
to
public
transit
in
urban
centers
all
across
the
country
with
decidedly
mixed
results
.
In
Atlanta
,
for
instance
,
investments
in
a
municipal
streetcar
system
failed
to
invigorate
ridership
,
and
the
city
,
as
with
most
metropolitan
regions
across
the
country
,
faces
declining
public
transit
usage
as
commuters
continue
to
drive
to
work
.
Other
critics
have
claimed
that
light
rails
naturally
lead
to
gentrification
and
skyrocketing
rents
in
neighborhoods
surrounding
stations
,
leading
to
a
dearth
of
already
scarce
affordable
housing
in
American
cities
.
As
with
most
public
projects
of
considerable
scale
,
the
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
has
also
specifically
attracted
a
number
of
NIMBY
Not
in
my
back
yard
based
concerns
,
including
a
class
action
lawsuit
from
Durham
residents
objecting
to
the
route’s
construction
alongside
their
neighborhood
near
Farrington
Road
.
Alongside
this
deeply
divided
debate
surrounding
the
light
rail’s
net
effects
on
Durham
,
it
is
also
noteworthy
to
consider
Duke’s
general
relationship
to
Durham
as
a
significant
stakeholder
in
many
urban
renewal
projects
.
When
the
city
dismantled
the
historic
Hayti
neighborhood
during
the
1960s
and
1970s
to
make
room
for
Highway
147
,
the
University
tacitly
accepted
the
arrangement
,
which
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
hundreds
of
black
owned
homes
and
businesses
in
Durham
.
Students
,
graduates
and
well
heeled
affiliates
of
Duke
have
benefited
financially
from
the
revitalization
of
the
city
often
to
the
detriment
of
low
income
residents
being
forced
into
other
neighborhoods
.
In
1999
,
when
plans
for
a
light
rail
connecting
Chapel
Hill
,
Durham
and
Raleigh
were
being
considered
,
University
administrators
balked
at
the
project
,
particularly
at
the
change
of
character
of
the
neighborhood
around
Duke
the
project
could
potentially
cause
.
Being
transitory
members
of
the
Durham
community
who
exist
mainly
inside
our
campus
bubble
,
undergraduates
most
likely
do
not
hold
a
major
stake
in
the
future
of
the
light
rail
.
Rather
,
whatever
effect
the
light
rail
may
have
for
the
next
20
years
will
land
mainly
on
the
shoulders
of
Durham
residents
who
will
bear
its
success
or
failure
.
In
making
an
informed
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
finalize
the
University’s
involvement
in
the
light
rail
,
administrators
should
pay
heed
to
voices
in
the
Durham
community
who
depend
on
Duke’s
action
or
inaction
in
achieving
community
centered
goals
.
Given
Duke’s
relationship
to
such
projects
in
the
past
,
hopefully
whatever
Price’s
decision
ends
up
being
is
one
that
will
benefit
many
outside
the
walls
of
this
college
campus
.
If
anyone
were
to
ask
what
singular
skill
I
am
most
proud
of
acquiring
at
Duke
,
I
would
respond
that
it
is
dealing
with
rejection
.
Not
memo
writing
,
pouring
agar
plates
,
or
wiggling
my
way
onto
the
C1
at
9
50
a
.
m
.
Rather
,
it
is
learning
to
be
rejected
from
amazing
opportunities
that
has
been
the
greatest
challenge
,
and
thus
achievement
,
so
far
in
my
early
Duke
career
.
Not
much
in
my
high
school
prepared
me
for
the
constant
cycles
of
application
and
rejection
that
sneak
their
way
into
every
aspect
of
my
life
.
The
25
percent
early
decision
acceptance
rate
at
the
time
I
applied
felt
low
,
but
now
seems
high
compared
to
the
acceptance
rates
of
every
insanely
competitive
opportunity
at
Duke
.
When
I
first
arrived
at
Duke
with
confidence
and
bright
eyes
,
I
wanted
to
get
involved
and
explore
new
interests
.
I
tried
out
for
things
I
had
been
too
scared
to
do
in
high
school
,
and
I
applied
to
research
opportunities
that
represented
why
I
had
wanted
to
come
to
Duke
.
In
those
few
weeks
,
I
experienced
my
first
taste
of
rejection
,
as
I
received
a
steady
stream
of
we
regret
to
inform
you
and
we
are
unable
to
offer
you
in
my
inbox
.
I
felt
like
all
of
these
opportunities
were
perfect
for
me
and
would
change
my
life
permanently
,
but
they
never
came
.
The
act
of
opening
my
mail
app
itself
began
to
stress
me
out
,
even
when
I
wasn’t
expecting
anything
in
particular
.
My
heart
would
start
racing
every
time
I
refreshed
my
inbox
,
and
I
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
no
new
emails
popped
up
.
Even
though
I
felt
capable
and
qualified
,
most
of
the
rejections
I
faced
during
my
first
year
were
my
fault
.
My
resume
was
that
of
an
undecided
first
year
student
,
who
had
no
marketable
skills
and
no
experience
.
I
was
unorganized
,
lazily
informed
and
idealistic
.
I
didn’t
even
know
where
to
start
building
experience
in
fields
I
had
interest
in
.
At
that
time
,
I
envied
my
friends
in
FOCUS
programs
.
They
had
their
classes
figured
out
and
had
close
relationships
with
professors
who
could
give
them
advice
on
research
and
write
recommendation
letters
on
their
behalf
.
The
continuous
string
of
rejections
I
received
taught
me
that
I
had
no
idea
what
I
wanted
to
do
,
which
was
why
I
wasn’t
quite
prepared
to
do
anything
.
I
was
a
pre
med
potential
neuroscience
or
chemistry
major
in
my
first
few
months
here
,
and
I
applied
to
pertinent
positions
.
Once
I
didn’t
gain
traction
in
those
areas
,
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
I
didn’t
know
what
I
cared
about
,
I
tried
to
do
some
soul
searching
.
I
found
several
areas
that
I
did
care
about
social
justice
,
environmental
science
,
public
health
and
thought
of
subject
areas
where
they
intersected
.
After
scrolling
through
websites
and
directories
,
I
hastily
dropped
my
neuro
classes
for
the
next
semester
and
added
public
policy
and
environmental
science
classes
.
I
applied
to
research
opportunities
the
next
fall
,
and
although
I
had
been
unsuccessful
for
so
long
,
I
had
a
new
sense
of
confidence
.
As
a
result
of
my
many
initial
rejections
,
I
was
forced
to
scrutinize
what
I
was
interested
in
and
what
I
wanted
to
do
in
life
.
I
realized
that
I
only
applied
to
certain
things
for
prestige
and
because
I
felt
obligated
to
.
Without
rejection
,
I
would’ve
never
looked
introspectively
at
my
passions
.
With
my
newfound
confidence
,
I
looked
intensely
for
positions
that
felt
incredibly
right
and
perfect
for
what
I
cared
about
.
With
this
new
attitude
,
I
entered
sophomore
year
applying
to
an
enormous
wave
of
positions
and
opportunities
.
I
was
rejected
from
several
,
but
I
eventually
got
into
an
environmental
health
lab
that
was
perfect
for
my
interests
,
after
my
dozens
of
prior
attempts
.
Nowadays
,
I
continue
to
apply
to
things
,
and
I
continue
to
get
rejected
from
things
that
I
want
desperately
.
But
my
heart
no
longer
races
when
I
get
a
mail
notification
.
I
shrug
and
go
on
with
my
day
.
I’ve
also
learned
to
never
expect
anything
,
and
to
never
take
any
opportunity
for
granted
.
nbsp
;
I’ve
come
to
realize
that
this
is
a
component
of
life
that
will
never
disappear
,
and
only
become
more
dominant
and
pervasive
.
Whether
I
go
into
research
or
apply
to
graduate
schools
,
the
cycle
of
applications
will
determine
my
future
.
However
,
I
don’t
have
to
allow
it
to
determine
my
day
to
day
happiness
or
to
diminish
my
hope
.
Rejection
while
at
Duke
continuously
reminds
me
that
I
have
so
much
room
to
grow
.
It
teaches
me
that
I
am
among
highly
qualified
peers
,
and
that
I
will
always
be
challenged
by
other
students
at
this
school
.
Most
importantly
,
it
has
taught
me
to
build
my
self
worth
and
validation
on
my
own
,
instead
of
relying
on
achievements
and
quantifiers
of
success
.
Sometimes
I
have
to
acknowledge
that
I
am
indeed
unqualified
in
comparison
to
the
people
around
me
.
But
I
can
work
on
this
by
continuing
to
pursue
the
things
I
care
about
,
even
if
I
don’t
get
validation
that
it
is
meant
for
me
.
This
summer
marks
the
first
summer
where
I
have
substantial
plans
and
am
not
scrambling
last
minute
to
piece
together
something
meaningful
.
In
previous
summers
,
I
was
rejected
from
every
program
or
position
I
applied
to
and
even
fired
from
two
jobs
before
I
could
start
both
not
entirely
my
fault
.
Although
now
I
do
feel
like
less
of
a
failure
for
getting
accepted
into
something
,
I
realize
that
my
previous
rejections
didn’t
really
mean
much
in
the
long
run
.
I
still
care
about
the
same
things
that
I
always
did
,
and
being
turned
down
for
opportunities
hasn’t
diminished
my
passions
.
If
anything
,
it
has
clarified
them
.
So
,
I
look
forward
to
a
future
full
of
constant
rejections
that
will
continue
to
catalyze
my
growth
and
force
me
to
create
my
self
worth
on
my
own
.
Catalyst
is
Duke’s
social
and
pre
professional
community

We
strive
to
foster
Silicon
Valley’s
spirit
of
innovation
by
building
a
network
of
student
mentors
and
collaborators
who
see
technology
as
a
for

.
We
had
the
opportunity
to
meet
with
all
candidates
running
for
the
position
,
and
after
much
internal
discussion
,
we
have
chosen
to
endorse
Luke
Farrell
for
Young
Trustee
.
All
candidates
demonstrated
passion
and
qualifications
to
serve
the
University
throughout
their
unique
experiences
.
We
believe
Luke’s
experience
collaborating
with
different
student
groups
,
advising
President
Price
,
and
sitting
as
a
voting
board
member
equip
him
to
continue
advocating
for
students
in
the
boardroom
.
His
work
in
his
undergraduate
career
have
heavily
benefited
students
,
such
as
making
events
campus
wide
more
accessible
and
helping
reverse
Price’s
decision
to
cut
healthcare
funds
.
We
value
Archana’s
passion
for
creating
safe
learning
spaces
with
Duke
Conversations
,
Brian’s
vision
for
our
future
relationship
with
the
Durham
community
,
and
Trey’s
work
to
improve
hate
and
bias
response
.
Catalyst
is
excited
for
what
the
future
holds
regardless
of
which
candidates
are
elected
as
all
are
strongly
qualified
to
execute
their
bright
visions
for
our
student
body
.
Nevertheless
,
Luke
Farrell
is
the
candidate
who
will
best
champion
the
interests
of
Duke’s
rapidly
growing
tech
community
.
There’s
this
essay
on
graduating
from
college
that
I’ve
read
more
times
than
I
can
count
.
The
author
Marina
Keegan
writes
that
the
one
thing
she’ll
miss
the
most
about
college
is
the
opposite
of
loneliness
.
She
writes
It’s
just
this
feeling
that
there
are
people
,
an
abundance
of
people
,
who
are
in
this
together
.
Everyone
comes
to
college
looking
for
this
feeling
,
but
I’ve
found
that
the
opposite
of
loneliness
isn’t
guaranteed
at
Duke
.
I
started
thinking
about
this
after
a
conversation
I
had
with
two
other
Duke
freshmen
.
As
we
were
waiting
for
flights
home
at
RDU
,
they
told
me
about
their
disappointing
first
semesters
.
While
they
blamed
difficult
classes
and
bad
food
,
they
talked
the
most
about
social
life
the
artificiality
of
the
first
few
weeks
of
meeting
people
,
eating
dinner
alone
most
nights
,
feeling
as
though
everyone
else
had
their
social
life
figured
out
.
It
made
me
think
about
why
I
had
liked
my
first
semester
,
and
I
realized
it
was
mostly
luck
.
I
was
lucky
that
my
parents
could
afford
a
pre
orientation
program
and
that
I
was
placed
in
a
small
dorm
with
a
good
community
.
Even
with
these
advantages
,
I
didn’t
feel
truly
comfortable
at
Duke
until
more
than
halfway
through
the
first
semester
.
The
number
of
people
that
rush
sororities
and
SLGs
,
essentially
selective
friend
groups
,
shows
that
many
students
perceive
a
need
for
a
social
niche
.
Of
course
,
a
close
friend
group
isn’t
necessary
for
a
good
social
life
,
and
some
enjoy
having
good
friends
from
different
places
.
But
many
want
a
group
chat
that
they
feel
comfortable
texting
when
they
want
to
get
dinner
,
a
good
idea
of
what
they’re
doing
that
weekend
,
and
the
feeling
of
walking
into
a
room
full
of
people
they
know
.
Communities
are
convenient
.
It’s
the
people
that
you
run
into
often
because
of
a
living
situation
,
club
,
or
mutual
friends
that
you
end
up
befriending
.
Many
of
my
best
memories
at
Duke
have
come
from
wandering
into
the
dorm
common
room
at
the
right
moment
.
From
talking
to
other
Duke
students
,
I’ve
found
that
many
haven’t
found
the
communities
that
create
a
sense
of
social
place
at
Duke
,
especially
freshman
year
.
College
is
less
cliquey
than
high
school
.
There
isn’t
that
one
table
where
you
eat
lunch
every
day
or
the
sense
that
if
you’re
part
of
one
friend
group
,
you
can’t
be
part
of
another
.
This
social
freedom
can
be
a
good
thing
.
It
makes
it
easier
to
meet
new
people
and
prioritize
the
friends
that
you
truly
want
to
spend
time
with
.
But
it
also
means
that
many
people
are
lost
in
the
web
that
is
Duke
social
life
.
There’s
the
feeling
of
being
part
of
several
groups
but
not
belonging
to
any
,
of
knowing
many
people
but
only
feeling
close
to
a
few
.
While
college
results
in
close
proximity
to
so
many
interesting
people
,
this
often
just
creates
an
urban
loneliness
the
feeling
of
being
surrounded
by
many
people
who
are
on
trajectories
that
won’t
intersect
with
yours
.
I
still
remember
looking
around
East
Campus
on
the
Friday
night
of
O
week
and
feeling
as
though
all
the
people
laughing
and
on
their
way
to
parties
had
already
found
their
place
.
Loneliness
at
Duke
is
compounded
by
this
quiet
expectation
that
it’ll
be
easy
to
make
friends
in
college
,
that
the
close
relationships
that
took
years
to
develop
in
high
school
will
form
in
the
first
few
months
.
We’re
used
to
thinking
of
academics
and
extracurriculars
as
areas
of
life
that
require
effort
and
friendship
as
something
that
just
happens
naturally
.
But
friendship
is
only
natural
for
people
who
find
it
easy
to
make
those
leaps
from
situational
acquaintances
to
actual
friends
,
to
ask
the
person
from
their
class
to
get
lunch
afterwards
or
make
sure
that
they
continue
to
see
friends
even
when
their
schedules
don’t
naturally
align
.
While
there
are
ways
to
increase
the
quality
of
your
relationships
,
finding
the
opposite
of
loneliness
is
about
both
depth
and
breadth
.
It’s
important
to
have
friends
to
have
long
lunches
with
but
it’s
also
valuable
to
have
a
community
,
a
group
for
watching
basketball
games
and
doing
Secret
Santa
with
.
But
since
a
community
is
an
interconnected
group
of
people
,
it’s
impossible
for
one
person
to
create
a
community
.
Unlike
many
of
the
things
Duke
students
do
,
you
don’t
get
more
belonging
the
more
work
you
put
into
it
.
As
psychologist
Mary
Pipher
said
,
We
may
not
have
control
,
but
we
have
choices
.
While
one
individual
can’t
create
a
community
,
we
can
each
do
things
that
encourage
the
opposite
of
loneliness
at
Duke
.
We
can
make
sure
that
the
person
that
doesn’t
know
everyone
else
at
the
club
event
or
party
feels
included
,
seriously
consider
how
housing
and
selective
groups
affect
social
life
,
and
talk
about
loneliness
in
a
way
that
makes
people
feel
less
alone
.
Where
do
you
go
on
campus
when
you
want
to
disappear
?
Ask
almost
anyone
on
campus
what
they
like
about
Duke
and
somewhere
in
their
answer
you’re
bound
to
hear
something
about
Duke’s
sense
of
community
.
They
might
mention
the
friend
they
made
during
their
first
week
on
campus
or
how
incredibly
close
knit
their
first
year
dorm
was
;
the
community
they
found
despite
the
splintering
outcomes
of
the
annual
rush
scramble
;
the
club
sports
team
they
play
on
or
the
sense
of
community
they
get
sleeping
in
a
tent
in
the
dead
of
winter
,
the
answer
will
involve
a
common
sentiment
.
One
where
Duke
students
are
seemingly
tied
to
each
other
24
7
.
If
you
ask
me
what
I
like
the
most
about
Duke
,
you’ll
get
a
similar
reply
.
It’s
for
that
reason
that
I
must
preface
the
rest
of
this
article
by
saying
I
love
the
communities
I
have
found
on
campus
.
Each
and
every
one
of
them
provide
me
with
a
unique
part
of
campus
culture
that
I
wouldn’t
otherwise
get
.
But
,
over
the
last
few
weeks
I
have
found
myself
wanting
to
act
unitarily
to
create
a
bit
of
distance
between
me
and
everyone
else
.
The
challenge
,
however
,
is
Duke’s
architectural
designers
.
I
love
West
Union
,
the
Wellness
Center
and
the
little
cubby
study
holes
in
Bostock
just
as
much
as
the
next
Duke
student
.
They
do
,
however
,
make
one
thing
entirely
impossible
the
ability
to
vanish
on
the
highly
visible
campus
we
all
live
on
.
Waking
up
in
a
room
with
a
roommate
I
love
living
with
you
Spencer
,
I
promise
before
going
to
lecture
halls
flooded
with
ambivalent
Stats
101
students
,
a
newsroom
esque
job
,
the
always
packed
third
floor
or
lower
level
2
of
Perkins
and
returning
to
a
gratifyingly
packed
common
room
is
my
idea
of
the
college
experience
.
It
is
what
I
was
dreaming
of
in
high
school
when
I
applied
to
Duke
.
Now
that
I
am
here
though
,
I
realize
that
I
have
neglected
the
ability
to
disappear
ripping
much
needed
quiet
time
alone
from
the
grasp
of
an
atypically
busy
schedule
as
a
critical
factor
required
to
be
a
fully
functional
Duke
student
.
Ironically
,
some
of
my
favorite
hidden
spots
on
campus
leave
me
the
most
exposed
to
the
view
of
anyone
.
The
Ruby
,
the
CMA’s
small
conference
room
,
and
the
trees
behind
Bassett
were
once
my
places
of
refuge
,
places
I
would
go
to
looking
to
get
away
from
from
deadlines
and
GroupMe
messages
and
the
communities
I
love
.
Now
,
all
I
am
greeted
with
when
I
go
searching
for
invisibility
are
awkward
gazes
screaming
out
,
I
see
you
,
and
this
is
my
place
,
too
.
Those
gazes
,
rather
the
people
to
whom
the
gazes
belong
,
are
absolutely
correct
.
The
only
place
on
Duke’s
campus
that
is
truly
mine
is
half
of
the
dorm
room
I
live
in
.
With
that
being
said
,
it
has
become
debilitatingly
impossible
to
get
a
few
moments
of
peace
and
quiet
to
myself
on
campus
.
Some
of
that
responsibility
falls
on
my
shoulders
.
First
year
Ryan
was
determined
to
meet
everyone
and
exist
everywhere
,
and
ultimately
made
it
hard
for
Sophomore
Ryan
to
retreat
to
any
corner
of
campus
without
being
stopped
for
a
short
conversation
or
being
persuaded
into
rolling
some
social
activity
that
would
end
up
sucking
away
all
the
time
he
should
be
saving
for
himself
.
But
,
the
other
part
of
that
responsibility
I
blame
on
the
sense
of
transparency
I’m
sure
a
lot
of
us
feel
as
active
members
in
the
Duke
community
.
No
matter
the
size
or
importance
of
one's
spot
in
the
Duke
community
,
the
sense
that
we
are
being
observed
by
our
peers
is
inescapable
.
So
,
I
return
to
the
question
I
asked
at
the
beginning
of
this
column
,
where
do
you
go
on
campus
when
you
want
to
disappear
?
I
don’t
know
how
to
answer
this
question
and
I
am
truly
soliciting
responses
.
It
may
be
that
I
am
looking
for
invisibility
in
all
the
wrong
places
.
It
may
be
that
I
have
to
get
off
campus
to
truly
get
away
from
Duke’s
grasp
.
It
may
be
that
the
burden
of
being
a
Duke
student
won’t
be
lifted
until
I
walk
across
that
graduation
stage
in
two
years
.
Or
it
could
be
what
I
am
most
terrified
of
,
that
I
never
find
a
place
to
get
a
break
from
the
stresses
of
adult
life
.
I
may
never
have
the
answer
to
my
question
.
But
,
for
now
,
all
I
can
say
is
please
,
Duke
designers
no
more
glass
structures
.
Devil’s
Krafthouse
,
the
first
vendor
of
the
renovated
West
Union
,
opened
at
the
end
of
February
on
the
first
floor
of
West
Union
.
We
have
just
completed
the
annual
ritual
of
rush
.
Hundreds
of
students
spent
hours
on
end
meeting
with
members
of
fraternities
,
sororities
,
and
non
Greek
selective
living
groups
SLGs
with
the
hope
of
being
accepted
to
a
tight
knit
social
communities
.
For
some
,
bid
day
was
the
day
where
their
dreams
came
true
,
opening
the
door
to
the
exciting
years
ahead
of
new
friendships
,
events
,
and
a
strong
support
network
.
For
others
,
bid
day
represented
the
disappointing
end
of
what
appeared
to
be
blossoming
relationships
and
the
shattering
of
your
vision
for
the
Duke
experience
that
lay
ahead
.
I
admire
Lizzie
Bond’s
courage
in
writing
about
the
exclusivity
which
has
deeply
permeated
Duke’s
social
culture
.
I
was
particularly
struck
by
her
answer
to
what
increased
selectivity’
has
led
to
More
dejection
,
emotional
distress
and
feelings
of
unworthiness
among
those
hundreds
of
students
who
unsuccessfully
rush
these
fraternities
,
sororities
and
non
Greek
SLGs
.
Reading
this
statement
,
along
with
hearing
about
the
social
stress
many
people
I
know
are
currently
experiencing
,
I
realized
that
I
need
to
open
up
about
the
difficult
struggles
I
faced
because
of
rush
.
During
the
first
semester
of
my
first
year
,
I
met
a
lot
guys
from
a
particular
fraternity
,
and
spent
many
weekends
having
fun
at
their
parties
.
As
winter
break
came
around
,
I
knew
that
I
wanted
to
rush
this
group
,
but
also
decided
to
check
out
as
many
other
fraternities
and
SLGs
as
possible
to
ensure
I
found
the
best
fit
.
I
went
to
dozens
of
rush
events
,
but
I
couldn’t
help
myself
from
thinking
about
that
one
fraternity
.
I
really
enjoyed
meeting
the
guys
,
and
I
felt
like
I
could
be
myself
with
them
.
Seeing
how
well
I
clicked
with
the
group
,
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
you
gotta
have
at
least
a
95
percent
chance
of
getting
in
.
Sitting
in
my
room
on
bid
night
,
I
waited
for
a
piece
of
paper
saying
congratulations
,
but
it
never
came
.
I
hadn’t
really
considered
the
possibility
of
not
getting
a
bid
from
what
I
envisioned
as
my
future
home
.
But
,
there
I
was
,
dealing
with
an
awful
mix
of
confusion
,
insecurity
and
rejection
.
These
feelings
were
exacerbated
by
subsequently
being
denied
a
bid
to
my
favorite
SLG
.
Fortunately
,
I
made
some
incredible
friends
sophomore
year
,
participated
in
an
amazing
living
and
learning
community
LLC
,
and
got
more
involved
in
the
activities
I
loved
.
I
found
my
niche
at
Duke
and
charted
a
path
I’m
really
happy
with
.
But
,
looking
back
,
I
wonder
what
it
would
have
been
like
having
a
unified
social
community
and
the
events
,
conveniences
,
and
connections
that
come
with
it
.
My
goal
of
sharing
my
experience
isn’t
to
criticize
these
groups
,
nor
the
rush
process
.
Instead
,
I
want
every
first
year
and
upperclassman
to
be
able
to
find
the
community
they
desire
,
irrespective
of
whether
they
rushed
or
if
they
received
a
bid
.
Everyone
should
feel
like
they
have
a
group
for
sports
games
,
parties
,
and
events
in
Durham
.
Nobody
should
be
excluded
from
having
these
amazing
experiences
because
a
particular
group
didn’t
think
they
were
the
right
fit
for
it
.
In
light
of
this
,
I
believe
we
should
create
different
kinds
of
community
at
Duke
.
Our
campus
desperately
needs
all
inclusive
social
groups
,
where
anyone
can
come
to
meet
new
people
and
have
an
amazing
time
.
Imagine
if
you
never
had
to
plan
your
weekends
,
because
you
knew
you
could
participate
in
something
fun
.
Getaways
,
parties
,
break
trips
,
and
beach
week
would
become
more
accessible
to
everyone
.
Going
to
Skyzone
,
Frankie’s
Fun
Park
,
Eno
River
,
or
the
movies
would
be
as
simple
as
seeing
a
message
in
a
group
chat
and
showing
up
.
I
was
excited
to
find
that
this
vision
is
already
underway
.

founded
the
organization
with
the
goal
of
making
Duke
a
home
for
everyone
.
Every
Sunday
at
7
p
.
m
.
,
DSG
hosts
community
dinners
in
Skillet
that
are
open
to
every
student
.
When
I
spoke
with
DSG
Executive
Communications
Director
Ryan
Bergamini
about
the
initiative
,
he
said
,
It’s
on
all
of
us
to
make
our
campus
community
.
We
are
creating
a
space
for
anyone
who
wants
to
meet
new
people
.
When
I
asked
if
DSG
is
an
actual
group
,
he
responded
with
a
question
What
really
defines
an
'actual'
group
?
He
went
on
to
say
that
the
name
attracts
interested
individuals
,
but
the
overall
goal
is
simply
creating
a
low
stress
environment
to
make
friends
and
for
people
to
enjoy
themselves
.
These
projects
are
just
the
start
.
Whether
by
our
student
government
or
individual
initiative
,
we
should
create
opportunities
for
students
to
grab
meals
or
explore
Durham
with
new
sets
of
people
.
We
can
build
the
type
of
relationships
that
typify
selective
living
groups
without
being
selective
or
having
a
living
requirement
.
Instead
,
the
bonds
will
be
come
from
a
genuine
interest
in
meeting
new
people
.
I
aspire
to
the
day
when
people
have
as
many
accessible
social
events
on
the
weekends
as
they
do
hours
of
homework
.
Not
only
would
fulfilling
this
goal
contribute
to
the
experience
of
independent
students
,
but
it
would
facilitate
new
friendships
and
opportunities
for
everyone
on
campus
.
This
is
a
call
for
community
;
let’s
act
upon
it
to
make
our
campus
a
better
place
.
Duke
students
often
tent
for
their
love
of
basketball
or
desire
for
more
community
.

I
wake
with
a
jolt
to
the
sound
of
the
line
monitors’
bullhorns
it
seems
like
my
body
has
more
of
a
reaction
to
the
distinct
sound
of
these
sirens
now
than
it
does
to
the
sound
of
sirens
that
would
go
off
during
a
real
emergency
.
Duke
privilege
,
anyone
?
I
shake
my
friend
awake
,
and
the
two
of
us
stumble
in
the
dark
,
zombie
like
,
as
masses
of
other
tenters
make
their
way
to
the
check
in
area
.
When
I
visited
Duke
for
Blue
Devil
Days
,
my
tour
guide
described
the
whole
concept
of
tenting
to
the
crowd
of
p
froshes
I
found
myself
in
.
As
he
went
through
the
stages
of
black
,
blue
and
white
tenting
,
I
could
see
a
couple
emotions
cross
my
fellow
p
froshes’
faces
confusion
,
excitement
,
even
a
little
fear
.
I
had
definitely
felt
all
three
.
I
thought
to
myself
,
Flash
forward
a
couple
of
years
.
.
.
I’m
a
junior
now
,
and
I’ve
tented
for
every
year
that
I’ve
been
here
.
Despite
snowfall
and
rainfall
and
a
flu
season
so
bad
that
Krzyzewskiville
was
shut
down
for
two
weeks
,
year
after
year
,
so
many
of
us
still
come
back
to
campus
from
winter
break
eager
to
call
K
ville
home
.
Perhaps
tenting
is
like
childbirth
.
Bear
with
me
for
a
second
here
This
discrepancy
is
attributed
to
the
'halo
effect
,
'
the
joy
that
comes
from
the
endorphin
rush
after
a
woman
gives
birth
.
The
surge
in
endorphins
does
not
erase
the
pain
and
discomfort
of
labor
completely
,
but
the
happiness
supersedes
the
pain
.
I
won’t
belabor
this
analogy
,
pun
unin
ed
.
I’m
not
trying
to
say
that
tenting
is
the
most
painful
experience
of
a
Duke
student’s
life
,
because
that’s
far
from
the
truth
.
But
it
is
true
that
when
I
look
back
on
my
last
three
years
of
tenting
,
what
I
remember
is
sprinting
off
the
CCX
to
K
ville
with
my
first
year
tent
to
make
it
to
our
night
shift
after
losing
track
of
time
at
a
friend’s
birthday
party
on
Central
campus
.
I
remember
little
things
,
like
everyone
repetitively
sending
a
dancing
cat
GIF
into
our
group
chat
.
When
I
think
of
my
sophomore
tenting
season
,
I
remember
the
ottoman
that
we
used
to
hold
our
communal
tent
snacks
,
and
all
of
us
wearing
clout
goggles
at
the
game
and
standing
a
couple
feet
away
from
Ken
Jeong
.
I
remember
the
post
game
euphoria
and
burning
benches
and
trying
to
get
into
a
very
packed
game
day
Shooters
afterwards
I
currently
have
a
50
percent
success
rate
.
It
takes
me
a
while
before
I
get
to
the
memories
of
sleeping
in
40
degree
weather
,
but
even
then
,
I
think
of
40
degrees
as
not
that
cold
when
there
are
ten
people
packed
in
the
tent
,
staying
up
late
sharing
stories
or
playing
Resistance
.
Similarly
,
memories
of
being
woken
up
every
hour
are
likewise
associated
with
the
McDonald’s
runs
that
my
tent
would
make
in
the
grace
periods
post
tent
checks
.
Social
culture
at
Duke
is
often
criticized
as
being
exclusive
in
many
ways
,
and
I
don’t
disagree
.
Maybe
this
contributes
to
why
I’m
such
a
big
fan
of
tenting
,
because
as
ridiculous
and
Crazie
as
it
is
,
there’s
definitely
a
sense
of
community
that
comes
with
it
.
I
see
this
in
the
inflatable
pool
that
popped
up
in
K
ville
in
the
couple
of
days
we
had
of
warm
weather
last
week
,
in
all
of
the
Instagram
accounts
created
to
document
each
tent’s
experience
,
and
in
the
not
line
monitor
jackets
that
Ryan
Bergamini
has
been
selling
.
And
of
course
,
nothing
beats
the
feeling
of
community
in
Cameron
Indoor
Stadium
during
game
day
,
everyone
painted
blue
and
dancing
to
Everytime
We
Touch
.
Tonight
marks
the
first
night
of
P
Checks
.
Another
tenting
season
has
come
and
gone
,
and
soon
the
mass
of
tents
known
as
K
ville
will
be
nothing
more
than
a
large
pile
of
trampled
fabric
.
I
know
game
day
is
fast
approaching
when
I
see
tenters
proudly
wearing
their
plastic
Duke
vs

for

at

Duke's
Board
of
Trustees
meetings
are
typically
held
at
the
Washington
Duke
Inn
.
Joys
do
not
stay
,
but
take
wing
and
fly
away
.
The
Roman
poet
Martial
captured
that
uncomfortable
feeling
of
seeing
something
good
drift
from
us
and
wanting
to
somehow
hold
onto
it
.
How
do
you
make
change
that
lasts
when
you’re
not
around
to
keep
it
in
place
?
Institutionalize
it
.
And
how
can
Duke
students
institutionalize
an
undergraduate’s
perspectives
?
By
electing
an
undergraduate
to
the
Board
of
Trustees
.
The
Young
Trustee
has
been
with
us
for
a
long
time
.
Since
1972
,
the
Duke
undergraduate
student
body
has
elected
someone
to
a
three
year
term
one
year
as
an
observer
and
two
years
as
a
voting
member
.
It
seems
a
promise
of
enduring
,
overlapping
student
voices
providing
our
insights
at
the
highest
levels
of
university
power
.
The
Young
Trustee
clearly
gets
people
excited
.
A
who’s
who
of
more
than
a
dozen
student
groups
have
backed
their
favorite
candidate
.
The
Young
Trustee
gives
us
a
sadly
too
infrequent
moment
of
something
like
real
community
.
Students
help
each
other’s
campaigns
and
carve
out
time
to
meet
together
and
discuss
their
visions
for
what
Duke
has
been
and
should
be
.
Whether
a
focused
pre
professional
group
like
Catalyst
or
a
wider
affinity
group
such
as
the
International
Association
,
those
groups
who
do
mention
the
whole
field
talk
about
their
choice
as
the
best
of
four
good
choices
.
And
hopefully
,
our
thinking
goes
,
these
finalists
will
continue
their
advocacy
for
issues
important
to
us
in
their
three
years
on
the
Board
.
Feminist
publication
The
Muse
endorses
Archana
Ahlawat
as
the
strongest
advocate
for
women
,
while
the
Editorial
Board
backs
Trey
Walk
as
the
most
anti
establishment
candidate
.
Read
whatever
endorsement
you
please
.
You’ll
find
the
common
theme
as
they
have
done
at
Duke
,
so
will
they
keep
on
doing
after
Duke
.
Except
that
once
the
Young
Trustee
is
elected
they
have
to
stop
thinking
like
an
undergraduate
,
at
least
partially
.

.
We’re
voting
,
the
email
reads
,
for
a
fiduciary
of
the
university
,
not
an
advocate
or
representative
.
The
Young
Trustees
hold
three
of
37
seats
on
the
Board
eight
percent
of
the
vote
and
are
meant
to
consider
what
is
best
for
the
whole
university
,
not
a
particular
constituency
.
So
,
here
is
my
question
does
the
way
that
the
position
of
Young
Trustee
is
structured
militate
against
the
Young
Trustee’s
remaining
a
fair
and
accurate
student
voice
?
To
be
clear
,
I
am
criticizing
the
office
and
not
its
future
occupant
.
It’s
a
shame
that
the
office
rewards
years
of
work
for
this
community
with
a
partial
moratorium
on
that
same
work
.
We’re
supporting
finalists
on
the
expectation
that
they’ll
keep
doing
what
they
have
been
doing
,
but
once
elected
they
are
meant
to
focus
less
on
constituencies
and
more
on
the
university
as
a
whole
.
So
far
as
being
Young
Trustee
requires
whoever
is
elected
to
distance
themselves
from
the
constituencies
they
worked
with
as
an
undergraduate
,
the
office
seems
structurally
ill
equipped
to
provide
an
undergraduate
perspective
to
the
Board’s
deliberations
.
It’s
a
problem
noted
in
years
past
,
and
it’s
not
going
away
.
But
there
is
a
further
problem
still
.
The
Young
Trustee
is
not
a
student
.
The
Young
Trustee
is
one
of
Duke’s
alumni
.
Granted
,
the
Young
Trustee
is
a
recent
graduate
,
but
they
are
no
longer
that
undergraduate
voice
in
any
meaningful
sense
.
Each
year
,
about
25
percent
of
Duke’s
undergraduate
population
changes
.
One
class
leaves
,
another
comes
in
,
and
inside
of
four
years
Duke
becomes
a
wholly
different
place
than
it
was
at
the
outset
.
Think
of
everything
that’s
happened
for
you
in
the
past
week
.
In
the
past
year
.
Think
of
how
steadily
the
fabric
of
this
place
changes
.
Imagine
how
much
your
knowledge
of
Duke
would
change
,
how
disconnected
from
this
day
in
,
day
out
reality
you’d
feel
,
if
you
were
only
on
campus
four
times
a
year
.
Per
its
own
website
,
The
Board
of
Trustees
meets
four
times
each
year
.
A
Young
Trustee
,
in
their
three
years
on
the
board
,
has
to
come
to
campus
12
times
.
We’ll
all
have
done
that
in
the
next
two
weeks
.
A
Young
Trustee
has
to
adjudicate
Duke’s
present
lives
they
know
so
little
about
through
their
personal
,
limited
experience
of
Duke’s
past
.
Perhaps
the
Young
Trustee
can
come
back
to
campus
more
if
they
can
take
time
off
from
work
or
graduate
school
or
whatever
comes
next
but
time
and
distance
will
do
their
work
.
So
,
I
ask
can
the
Young
Trustee
remain
a
fair
and
accurate
voice
for
students
,
despite
the
role’s
focus
on
creating
distance
from
students
and
the
reality
that
the
office
is
occupied
by
a
former
student
growing
ever
further
from
Duke
?
It
seems
a
sad
state
of
affairs
.
What
have
we
got
?
We’ve
overestimated
the
extent
to
which
the
role
of
Young
Trustee
allows
its
occupant
to
continue
doing
the
work
that
gained
their
election
.
We
have
student
groups
coming
together
,
students
making
time
to
discuss
their
views
and
people
across
campus
in
dialogue
about
their
hopes
and
priorities
.
We
pound
pavement
,
start
websites
,
overhaul
our
social
media
,
put
up
flyers
.
All
we’ll
have
to
show
for
it
is
one
elected
official
who
can’t
do
that
much
for
us
.
Or
,
instead
of
placing
significant
hope
for
change
in
one
position
,
we
could
appreciate
the
fact
that
we
have
a
student
led
,
student
driven
mechanism
for
effecting
change
that
we
can
leave
dormant
until
the
next
Young
Trustee
election
,
or
put
to
some
good
use
in
the
meantime
.

Henry
David
Thoreau
wrote
that
Even
voting
for
the
right
is
doing
nothing
for
it
.
We
pour
so
much
effort
into
choosing
the
occupant
of
what’s
effectively
an
alumni
position
.
What
could
we
change
on
this
campus
if
we
poured
this
same
effort
,
these
same
three
weeks
of
near
constant
energy
,
into
any
one
of
the
causes
that
we
think
one
person
alone
should
be
able
to
handle
?
We’ve
shown
ourselves
quite
ready
to
come
together
,
pick
a
goal
,
and
do
our
all
to
reach
it
.
How
much
better
this
place
would
be
if
we
all
did
that
more
often
.
Duke
will
start
to
feel
like
home
slowly
at
first
.
Then
,
all
at
once
,
you
offhandedly
refer
to
going
back
home’
during
winter
break
of
your
first
year
,
to
which
your
mom
casts
you
a
look
of
confusion
and
disappointment
.
You
are
at
home
,
she
says
.
As
a
senior
,
I
ache
for
home
more
than
I
did
as
a
first
year
.
I’m
looking
at
jobs
in
cities
far
away
and
I’m
consumed
by
the
feeling
of
needing
to
be
back
in
the
familiar
territory
of
my
hometown
,
cushioned
by
the
safety
net
of
my
parents
,
sisters
and
friends
.
What’s
the
opposite
of
wanting
wide
open
spaces
?
Of
wanting
to
be
returned
to
what
is
comfortable
so
much
that
it
hurts
?
nbsp
;
Is
it
just
homesickness
?
I
left
my
home
in
Charlotte
,
North
Carolina
on
a
muggy
day
in
August
of
2015
.
18
year
old
me
wanted
adventure
.
I
craved
wide
open
spaces
big
enough
to
make
mistakes
,
ready
to
leave
behind
what
was
comfortable
in
favor
of
Duke’s
big
,
scary
campus
.
19
year
old
me
wanted
more
.
So
I
packed
my
bags
again
and
took
off
to
South
Africa
for
a
summer
on
a
DukeEngage
program
,
in
search
of
adventure
with
every
mile
I
put
between
me
and
home
7
,
978
miles
,
to
be
exact
.
I
wrote
in
my
journal
that
summer
about
finding
home
unexpectedly
in
the
winding
streets
of
my
neighborhood
of
Tamboerskloof
;
in
a
coffee
shop
;
in
a
new
job
.
Even
on
a
quest
to
go
as
far
as
I
had
ever
been
away
from
home
,
I
kept
searching
for
it
.
For
the
familiar
.
Was
it
that
I
found
a
new
home
,
or
just
that
I
wanted
to
taste
what
leaving
home
felt
like
?
Planting
my
flag
on
a
different
planet
,
just
for
a
little
while
,
to
see
what
the
view
is
like
from
over
there
?
I
arrived
back
in
North
Carolina
two
months
later
to
a
Welcome
Home
sign
resting
on
the
kitchen
table
,
but
without
clarity
over
if
home
can
be
two
places
at
once
.

has
enough
.
I
call
home
almost
daily
.
I
don’t
even
think
about
it
,
I
just
reach
for
my
phone
absentmindedly
and
press
the
dial
button
to
connect
to
the
landline
on
School
House
Lane
,
the
street
where
I
grew
up
and
my
parents
still
live
.
I’m
learning
that
calling
a
place
home
isn’t
the
same
as
calling
home
.
Even
when
all
the
paperwork
a
college
diploma
,
tax
returns
,
and
a
heavily
stamped
passport
clearly
indicates
that
I
no
longer
live
at
home
,
all
the
same
,
there
I
am
,
clutching
my
phone
and
hoping
that
someone
still
picks
up
on
the
same
landline
I’ve
called
my
whole
life
.
And
that’s
what
this
whole
thing
is
about
.
The
places
we
call
home
.
The
home
we
call
to
instinctively
.
As
a
head
orientation
counselor
,
it’s
been
my
job
to
make
this
campus
feel
like
home
for
incoming
first
years
from
their
very
first
week
.
As
we
feverishly
unpack
cars
in
100
degree
heat
,
I
shout
the
phrase
nbsp
;
Welcome
home
to
every
first
year
and
their
families
over
and
over
until
my
voice
is
hoarse

The
orientation
programming
centers
around
the
idea
that
Duke
will
become
home
for
every
first
year
student
as
long
as
they
immerse
themselves
in
clubs
and
organizations
and
use
the
resources
to
their
fullest
extent
.
To
do
this
successfully
,
though
,
we
ask
one
thing
forget
about
your
home
.
The
other
one
,
the
home
you
came
here
from
.
The
mentality
we
hear
as
college
students
is
that
home
isn’t
a
place
,
it’s
the
people
you
surround
yourself
with
.
That
home
can
be
folded
up
and
packed
up
into
a
few
suitcases
.
That
Duke
can
become
a
home
to
all
if
you
try
hard
enough
.
But
as
I
am
beginning
the
slow
descent
into
leaving
the
home
I’ve
made
here
and
trading
it
for
another
strange
place
,
I’m
realizing
that
home
isn’t
so
easy
to
take
with
you
.
Maybe
the
reason
we
are
quick
to
label
other
places
home
is
that
we
are
running
away
from
the
places
that
raised
us
the
asphalt
that
scraped
my
knees
as
I
learned
how
to
ride
a
bike
,
the
basketball
hoop
with
the
frayed
net
still
in
the
driveway
,
the
doorway
with
pencil
marks
measuring
my
height
every
year
until
I
stopped
growing
.
Four
years
at
Duke
has
shown
me
that
I
can
call
many
places
home
,
but
there’s
still
only
one
home
I
dial
to
when
I
need
a
reminder
of
what
raised
me
.
Duke
UNC
is
big
game
.
It’s
one
of
the
most
storied
rivalries
in
all
of
sports
.
It
should
also
be
one
of
the
few
days
at
Duke
where
everyone
on
campus
comes
together
to
celebrate
our
team
and
our
school
.
Yet
,
by
limiting
K
Ville
festivities
to
only
tenters
,
the
Duke
administration
and
the
line
monitor
staff
have
only
made
the
biggest
day
of
the
year
more
exclusive
.
The
centralized
tailgate
in
K
Ville
one
of
the
most
recognizable
parts
of
Duke’s
sports
culture
was
replaced
by
scattered
pockets
of
students
on
West
Campus
quads
,
in
dorms
and
selective
sections
,
at
off
campus
houses
,
and
even
at
Shooters
.
Combined
with
the
bad
weather
,
it
made
for
a
decidedly
underwhelming
build
up
to
one
of
the
biggest
games
of
the
season
.
There
was
none
of
the
hype
,
sense
of
community
,
or
overarching
school
spirit
that
could
be
felt
in
K
Ville
last
year
.
Instead
,
people
were
isolated
and
broken
up
,
doing
their
own
thing
instead
of
joining
together
with
the
rest
of
campus
to
tell
Carolina
to
go
to
hell
.
If
the
Duke
administration
is
serious
about
building
and
sustaining
a
school
wide
sense
of
community
on
campus
,
then
blocking
the
vast
majority
of
students
from
K
Ville
on
gameday
is
not
the
way
to
go
about
it
.
Not
everyone
can
tent
,
whether
for
personal
,
medical
or
financial
reasons
.
Not
everyone
team
,
playing
for
the
entire
Duke
community
.
It
binds
us
together
and
plays
a
big
role
in
what
it
means
to
go
here
.
Yet
without
the
opportunity
to
come
together
as
a
school
to
acknowledge
and
celebrate
that
,
those
ideals
are
going
to
grow
further
and
further
from
reality
.
The
main
motivation
for
the
policy
change
,
of
course
,
was
the
chaos
that
occurred
right
before
tip
off
last
year
students
in
walk
up
line
jostled
to
get
to
the
front
and
created
an
unsafe
situation
.
I
fully
support
the
elimination
of
walk
up
line
and
applaud
the
line
monitors
for
avoiding
a
repeat
of
last
year’s
unfortunate
situation
.
But
the
issue
is
gone
now
walk
up
line
is
dead
.
The
tailgate
itself
was
never
the
issue
.
Although
there
were
some
incidents
in
K
Ville
,
no
one
got
hurt
and
nothing
serious
happened
.
Not
only
that
,
but
those
problems
are
going
to
arise
no
matter
where
people
congregate
to
watch
the
game
.
Is
it
really
safer
to
have
those
same
events
happen
across
Durham
at
bars
,
houses
,
and
dorms
than
to
consolidate
the
Duke
population
in
a
controlled
location
where
campus
security
can
monitor
them
?
I
understand
where
the
line
monitors
are
coming
from
when
they
support
this
change
.
After
all
,
dealing
with
thousands
of
Duke
students
is
overwhelming
for
a
group
of
fellow
undergraduates
to
handle
which
is
why
they
shouldn’t
have
to
.
The
Duke
UNC
K
Ville
tailgate
needs
to
come
back
,
but
it
needs
to
come
back
with
some
changes
.
An
increased
presence
from
campus
security
would
do
a
lot
to
reduce
any
repeat
of
the
few
issues
from
last
year
and
would
put
the
responsibility
of
managing
the
event
in
the
hands
of
trained
professionals
.
Making
it
tenters
only
in
the
time
immediately
leading
up
to
entry
would
also
help
prevent
any
last
minute
jostling
or
confusion
like
last
year
.
It
is
possible
to
have
a
more
controlled
tailgate
while
still
keeping
it
open
to
all
,
and
Duke
needs
to
find
that
balance
.
In
a
recent
email
to
the
student
body
,
John
Vaughn
announced
that
Student
Health
would
no
longer
be
offering
students
the
drop
in
hours
available
under
the
recently
adopted
open
access
model
.
In
order
to
see
a
doctor
,
students
will
now
have
to
make
an
appointment
ahead
of
time
.
It
is
hard
to
argue
that
the
complaints
Vaughn
cites
,
particularly
the
extensive
wait
times
,
aren’t
a
real
problem
.
However
,
requiring
students
to
schedule
appointments
days
in
advance
will
make
it
harder
for
students
,
especially
low
income
students
,
to
receive
timely
medical
care
for
contagious
illnesses
.
This
is
particularly
concerning
given
the
arrival
of
flu
season
.
The
solution
to
this
problem
isn’t
limiting
access
to
drop
in
appointments
.
If
there
were
more
practitioners
available
,
students
wouldn’t
complain
about
several
hour
long
waits
.
In
2016
,
Duke
budgeted
approximately
30
million
on
the
construction
of
the
new
Student
Wellness
Center
.
According
to
the
American
Academy
of
Family
Physicians
,
the
total
cost
of
hiring
a
new
primary
care
doctor
is
typically
around
250
,
000
.
Instead
of
spending
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
on
campus
aesthetics
,
we
should
be
making
sure
that
every
student
can
see
a
doctor
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
.
Although
access
to
quality
health
services
doesn’t
look
as
nice
on
an
admissions
tour
as
a
shiny
glass
building
with
a
grand
piano
,
the
health
of
the
student
body
should
be
a
bigger
priority
for
both
the
administration
and
donors
.
Any
university
with
a
nearly
9
billion
endowment
,
new
91
million
dollar
housing
complex
,
and
on
tap
sparkling
water
can
do
better
.
Kari
Larsen
A
monochromatic
Instagram
feed
,
a
Pinterest
inspired
dorm
room
,
geometric
tattoos
so
aesthetic
.
When
we
think
of
the
word
aesthetic
,
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
visual
beauty
.
However
,
as
a
result
of
my
decision
to
better
understand
my
heritage
,
my
parents
,
and
the
country
I
grew
up
in
for
17
years
,
I
have
learned
that
our
instinct
to
attribute
aestheticism
to
physical
beauty
is
nothing
but
a
modern
artifact
.
It
is
the
second
week
of
the
semester
of
Spring
2019
.
I
sit
in
Professor
Wong’s
Chinese
philosophy
class
,
discussing
the
minutiae
of
people
to
do
the
right
thing
?
It
seems
that
all
around
me
people
worship
the
ugly
as
what
is
in
.
To
the
Crowell
resident
who
thought
it
would
be
funny
to
push
over
a
bike
to
impress
his
friend
,
can
your
action
be
called
beautiful
?
To
the
two
professors
who
threatened
the
Chinese
students
just
trying
to
connect
through
a
shared
language
,
where
was
your
forgiveness
and
humility
?
And
finally
,
to
you
,
Duke
student
I
challenge
you
to
choose
the
beautiful
.
In
the
name
of
upholding
freedom
of
expression
against
pro
Israel
lobbies
,
the
opinion
piece
by
the
Duke
Chronicle
editorial
board
,
AIPAC
and
the
Blockade
on
Critiquing
Israel
,
engages
in
a
series
of
offensive
and
inaccurate
accusations
.
To
start
with
,
there
is
no
blockade
on
critiquing
Israel
in
this
country
.
There
is
a
diversity
of
viewpoints
expressed
regularly
regarding
the
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict
and
Israel's
role
in
it
.
We
see
those
views
articulated
in
many
places
,
including
the
media
and
college
campuses
,
in
legislatures
,
civil
rights
organizations
and
faith
groups
and
within
the
larger
Jewish
community
itself
.
Claiming
falsely
that
the
fundamental
problem
is
conflation
of
anti
Zionism
with
anti
Semitism
,
the
Chronicle
attacks
Zionism
support
of
the
Jewish
State
in
a
way
that
shows
exactly
how
such
assaults
can
enter
the
area
of
anti
Semitism
.
Criticism
of
Israeli
policies
are
welcome
and
necessary
to
debate
within
democratic
societies
,
both
within
Israel
and
without
,
as
are
discussions
based
on
deep
concern
over
the
security
and
human
rights
issues
the
Israeli
Palestinian
conflict
raises
.
What
enters
the
area
of
anti
Semitism
and
must
be
called
out
as
such
is
when
Israel's
fundamental
legitimacy
as
a
Jewish
state
on
the
historic
home
of
the
Jewish
people
is
denied
.
Or
when
,
as
in
this
editorial
,
Israel
is
demonized
not
as
the
fulfillment
of
Jewish
liberation
for
Jews
of
all
races
and
ethnicities
,
but
as
a
settler
colonialist
state
with
no
right
to
have
come
into
being
or
to
continue
to
exist
.
Or
when
there
is
not
even
mention
of
the
role
of
Hamas
,
which
controls
Gaza
and
remains
committed
to
terrorism
against
civilians
and
the
destruction
of
Israel
.
What
must
be
called
out
is
when
a
piece
like
this
editorial
assumes
for
itself
the
right
to
say
that
Zionism
has
nothing
to
do
with
Judaism
.
That
ignores
or
wills
into
oblivion
two
thousand
years
of
daily
Jewish
prayers
for
the
return
to
Zion
and
the
actual
history
of
the
Jewish
movement
for
self
determination
.
Throughout
millennia
of
Jew
hatred
,
expressed
consistently
in
discrimination
,
murderous
attacks
,
and
sometimes
genocide
across
the
globe
,
Jews
of
every
race
,
orientation
and
ethnicity
longed
to
return
to
their
homeland
,
joining
the
small
number
of
Jews
who
had
lived
there
consistently
since
biblical
times
.
Instead
,
what
truly
seems
to
trouble
the
editorial
board
,
reflecting
their
bias
,
is
not
the
alleged
absence
of
criticism
,
but
the
fact
that
America
and
Americans
support
the
legitimate
right
of
Israel
to
exist
in
the
historic
home
of
the
Jewish
people
.
It
is
not
because
of
any
alleged
excessive
influence
of
AIPAC
,
which
engages
in
completely
legitimate
lobbying
and
education
about
Israel
,
that
America
and
Americans
support
Israel
.
It's
because
Israel
is
the
only
democracy
in
the
Middle
East
,
because
the
U
.
S
.
and
Israel
have
shared
democratic
values
,
because
Israel
has
been
a
reliable
ally
of
the
U
.
S
.
for
decades
,
and
because
Israel
has
sought
peace
with
the
Palestinians
for
years
,
in
the
face
of
Palestinian
rejectionism
and
support
for
the
destruction
of
the
Jewish
state
.
Is
either
Israel
or
the
United
States
always
true
to
their
best
articulation
of
those
values
?
No
.
It’s
a
work
in
progress
and
the
current
environment
around
the
globe
is
deeply
challenging
to
those
of
us
who
support
pluralistic
democracies
.
But
that
doesn’t
mean
that
Israel
,
any
more
than
the
U
.
S
.
,
has
no
right
to
exist
.
The
Chronicle
editorial
also
tries
to
create
a
false
dichotomy
between
support
of
civil
rights
in
America
and
support
for
Israel
.
In
fact
,
Israel
has
been
supported
by
many
of
the
great
civil
rights
activists
in
America
.
The
attempt
to
portray
those
who
support
Israel
as
part
of
a
pattern
of
anti
minority
attitudes
in
America
is
a
false
construct
and
demonstrably
so
.
Yet
on
many
campuses
support
for
Israel
has
become
a
litmus
test
for
denying
Jewish
students
and
groups
entry
into
civil
rights
coalitions
and
events
.
That
is
a
false
and
damaging
conflation
indeed
.
None
of
this
is
to
deny
the
suffering
of
the
Palestinians
in
Gaza
or
the
fact
that
two
peoples
have
legitimate
claims
to
a
small
piece
of
land
.
But
if
the
editorial
had
truly
been
interested
in
the
well
being
of
Israelis
and
Palestinians
,
it
could
have
offered
approaches
to
enhance
the
chances
for
a
two
state
solution
.
It
could
have
talked
not
only
about
what's
wrong
with
Israel
but
how
the
Palestinians
have
repeatedly
rejected
Israeli
offers
that
could
have
led
to
a
Palestinian
state
.
It
could
have
urged
Palestinians
to
control
terrorism
and
rejection
of
Israel
,
as
exhibited
by
Hamas
in
Gaza
on
a
regular
basis
.
And
it
could
have
urged
Israel
to
renounce
certain
actions
and
policies
and
take
steps
to
enhance
two
state
possibilities
.
As
an
organization
that
combats
anti
Semitism
,
the
Anti
Defamation
League
has
been
outspoken
in
attacking
the
surge
of
extreme
right
wing
hatred
of
Jews
,
most
clearly
manifest
at
Charlottesville
and
Pittsburgh
.
Such
anti
Semitism
is
blatant
and
violent
,
easy
to
identify
.
Anti
Semitism
from
the
left
is
much
harder
to
identify
,
partly
because
it
often
appears
in
the
guise
of
mere
criticism
of
Israel
and
defense
of
human
rights
.
But
charges
that
ominously
powerful
Jewish
and
pro
Israel
groups
label
any
criticism
of
Israel
as
anti
Semitism
are
not
true
and
play
into
virulent
anti
Semitic
tropes
.
We
welcome
the
debates
,
but
not
the
false
and
dangerous
accusation
that
Jewish
financial
control
over
the
U
.
S
.
Congress
is
the
cause
of
pro
Israel
American
policy
and
sentiment
,
or
the
stifling
of
free
expression
.
And
when
the
legitimacy
of
the
Jewish
state
is
denied
,
by
referencing
it
as
a
settler
colonialist
state
,
or
Israel
and
those
who
support
her
are
demonized
,
as
in
this
editorial
,
then
the
anti
Semitic
label
is
appropriate
.
We
have
full
confidence
that
the
American
people
and
the
Duke
University
campus
,
its
students
,
faculty
,
alumni
and
administration
,
while
granting
the
right
of
free
expression
,
will
reject
this
outlandish
and
hateful
editorial
as
not
representing
American
values
or
that
of
the
university
.
One
hundred
and
sixty
eight
years
ago
this
January
,
Leo
Tolstoy
wrote
what
is
possibly
the
greatest
diary
entry
of
all

It
read
Tolstoy
might
have
well
been
a
senior
at
Duke
University
,
because
these
days
my
journal
reads
almost
the
same
,
except
for
the
horse
part
.
Parties
I’ve
been
to
have
often
left
me
with
a
dramatic
story
to
tell
my
friends
about
the
person
I
made
eye
contact
with
across
a
crowded
room
and
fell
in
love
with
at
first
sight
or
imagined
that
nbsp
;
I
had
and
then
woke
up
the
next
day
feeling
like
I’ve
lost
my
head
.
For
as
fun
as
college
is
supposed
to
be
,
a
time
of
self
discovery
and
exciting
new
relationships
it
hasn’t
always
been
easy
.
I
haven’t
had
the
Blue
Devil
love
story
that
the
alumni
magazine
will
chronicle
a
few
years
from
now
,
the
one
where
we
met
the
second
day
of
O
week
or
had
our
first
date
at
the
Nasher
.
My
college
love
stories
require
a
little
more
imagination
and
a
slightly
different
map
of
landmarks
.
A
picnic
blanket
on
the
Chapel
quad
,
a
field
playing
frisbee
,
the
couch
where
I’ve
spent
a
lot
of
nights
in
the
company
of
friends
and
occasionally
more
than
friends
.
All
the
places
where
my
cheeks
have
burned
bright
red
and
I’ve
awkwardly
smiled
to
cover
it
up
.
All
the
benches
where
I’ve
sat
inches
away
from
someone
who
made
me
laugh
.
Every
dance
floor
where
I’ve
shed
my
cares
,
let
my
hair
down
,
and
moved
to
the
beat
of
the
music
until
the
stars
came
out
.
The
sum
of
these
are
not
nothing
.
It’s
our
imperative
as
college
students
to
get
wound
up
over
labels
,
obsessed
with
the
heightened
drama
of
.
I
can’t
tally
the
number
of
times
I’ve
listened
while
a
friend
has
spent
hours
debating
whether
or
not
to
text
a
potential
love
interest
first
,
or
wondering
if
both
parties
are
in
agreement
that
it
is
,
in
fact
,
a
date
.
Multiply
that
by
the
number
of
romantic
partners
that
the
average
college
student
has
and
it’s
hard
to
believe
that
we
have
time
to
talk
about
anything
else
.
So
,
how
do
you
decide
if
you’ve
fallen
in
love
,
or
if
you
only
imagine
that
you
have
?
I
read
once
about
a
sort
of
litmus
test
for
a
relationship
in
the
form
of
the
following
question
If
I
get
the
flu
,
are
you
bringing
me
soup
?
I
can
look
back
on
college
and
think
of
a
half
dozen
soup
bringing’
relationships
.
Times
when
I’ve
depended
on
another
person
for
encouragement
,
entertainment
,
advice
,
and
,
sometimes
,
soup
.
In
sickness
and
in
health
.
And
maybe
that’s
enough

Not
being
in
a
long
term
romantic
relationship
at
Duke
has
pushed
me
to
seek
out
treasured
friendships
,
ones
built
on
mutual
trust
and
love
and
openness
,
relationships
that
will
stay
with
me
far
beyond
college
.
These
might
be
the
truest
love
stories
of
them
all
.
Tolstoy
said
something
else
about
love
that
I
also
think
is
true
.
If
it
is
true
that
there
are
as
many
minds
are
there
are
heads
,
then
there
are
as
many
kinds
of
love
as
there
are
hearts
.
There
are
as
many
kinds
of
Blue
Devil
love
stories
as
there
are
students
at
Duke
love
stories
that
begin
in
a
tent
,
or
over
a
coffee
in
Vondy
,
or
at
a
jazz
concert
.
Love
stories
that
change
and
grow
,
and
are
serious
,
or
hilarious
,
or
only
last
for
as
long
as
the
song
is
playing
.
Love
stories
that
involve
a
little
bit
of
magic
,
too
.
When
I
began
Duke
,
the
following
words
could
have
described
me
uncertain
,
insecure
,
awkward
,
single
.
Four
years
later
many
of
those
things
have
changed
.
I
am
curious
,
confident
,
ambitious
,
happy
.
And
single
.
Four
years
from
now
it’s
possible
that
that
last
one
will
be
completely
different
,
that
the
biggest
love
story
is
one
that’s
ahead
.
Though
,
when
I
think
of
the
many
people
who
have
come
through
my
life
along
the
way
I’m
not
sure
that
it’s
a
word
I’d
want
to
trade
for
one
perfect
Blue
Devil
love
story
.
For
now
,
I
am
still
becoming
me
stuck
somewhere
between
the
right
now
and
the
not
yet
.
I’ve
got
mistakes
left
to
make
and
a
ten
page
bucket
list
of
things
to
do
before
I
settle
down
into
a
long
term
relationship
.
I’ve
got
horses
left
to
buy
which
I
don’t
need
at
all
.
The
proposed
light
rail
would
have
a
stop
nbsp
;
along
Lasalle
Street
and
nbsp
;
Erwin
Road
near
Duke
Hospital
.
Today
,
your
voice
can
make
a
lasting
,
positive
impact
on
the
relationship
between
Duke
and
Durham
.
First
,
fast
forward
10
years
.
You
return
to
Duke
with
friends
for
a
reunion
.
You’re
standing
on
a
platform
near
Duke
campus
at
sunset
,
with
a
lavender
sky
visible
atop
the
loblolly
pines
.
You
hop
on
a
train
.
Catch
a
ride
downtown
.
What
if
you
and
thousands
of
classmates
and
residents
of
Durham
could
say
,
We
helped
make
this
happen
.
We
let
our
voices
be
heard
at
the
perfect
time
!
?
That
perfect
time
is
NOW
.
As
board
members
of
the
Durham
People’s
Alliance
,
a
coalition
of
over
1
,
400
residents
,
we
urge
you
to
join
us
and
support
light
rail
.
This
project
,
coordinated
by
GoTriangle
,
will
connect
Duke
with
Durham
and
surrounding
areas
.
Regional
economic
growth
and
environmental
sustainability
need
alternatives
to
cars
and
buses
for
connecting
us
to
entertainment
,
educational
opportunities
,
jobs
,
and
affordable
housing
.
By
February
28
,
Duke
and
GoTriangle
need
a
cooperative
agreement
for
federal
funding
.
GoTriangle
has
redesigned
the
rail
to
create
an
underground
tunnel
and
keep
access
to
American
Tobacco
Campus
unobstructed
.
It
has
worked
with
Duke
Hospital
to
clear
access
to
emergency
entrances
on
Erwin
Road
.
Progress
IS
being
made
!
We’re
excited
about
light
rail
!
We’ve
shared
our
support
with
Duke
administrators
,
and
hope
you’ll
do
the
same
.
Please
tell
Duke
to
stay
on
board
and
stay
on
track
to
meet
the
deadline
for
federal
transportation
funding
.
If
Duke
negotiates
with
GoTriangle
,
we’re
confident
they’ll
get
to
YES
!
And
you’ll
be
able
to
look
back
at
your
years
at
Duke
and
say
,
my
voice
made
a
lasting
,
positive
impact
in
Durham
!

Last
year
I
wrote
a
column
concluding
that
critics
impetuously
characterize
Greek
life
as
homogenous
,
and
in
effect
,
dehumanize
its
members
.
Criticism
for
lack
of
diversity
is
constant
,
but
fails
to
move
beyond
unfair
generalizations
.
Unfortunately
the
overall
smear
campaign
on
Greek
life
has
persevered
,
so
I’m
back
to
defend
it
.
While
I
am
more
than
open
to
a
fair
debate
about
what
is
certainly
an
imperfect
system
,
I
think
that
it's
important
for
critics
to
assess
all
of
the
information
and
to
be
more
cognizant
of
inaccurate
and
divisive
rhetoric
.
Duke
is
a
university
that
prides
itself
on
tolerance
or
at
least
that’s
what
I
was
told
when
I
arrived
on
campus
.
If
you’ve
been
following
The
Chronicle’s
opinion
section
over
the
past
few
weeks
,
you
may
doubt
that
Duke
is
so
tolerant
.
A
fellow
columnist
of
mine
at
The
Chronicle
portrayed
an
example
of
prejudice
against
Greek
life
when
writing
,
We
resent
students
in
Greek
life
.
They
are
the
reason
that
we
are
consistently
unable
or
unwilling
to
build
the
least
semblance
of
community
in
our
own
situations
.
While
I
hope
that
this
quotation
was
at
least
somewhat
in
jest
,
I
would
like
to
attack
it
at
face
value
.
Although
some
independent
students
do
feel
isolated
,
lonely
,
and
excluded
from
social
activities
,
the
blame
should
not
fall
on
SLGs
and
Greek
organizations
.
As
is
the
case
for
other
groups
on
campus
,
it
is
not
the
responsibility
of
these
organizations
to
bear
the
entire
burden
of
fostering
social
connections
and
providing
entertainment
.
It
appears
that
many
believe
that
some
form
of
social
class
warfare
exists
on
campus
.
This
profoundly
divisive
and
unfounded
rhetoric
has
the
unfortunate
effect
of
creating
an
us
versus
them
mentality
,
which
is
just
the
opposite
of
what
our
student
body
needs
right
now
.
It’s
no
secret
that
buried
deeply
in
the
Duke
community
exists
a
holier
than
thou
attitude
that
leads
to
a
demonization
of
students
in
Greek
life
.
In
that
case
,
is
exclusion
on
campus
really
rooted
in
Greek
life
?
Rather
than
play
a
blame
game
,
it
is
important
that
we
all
strive
to
make
Duke’s
social
scene
more
inclusive
.
Yet
,
the
proposed
solution
by
some
is
eliminating
SLGs
and
Greek
life
altogether
.
By
calling
to
abolish
Greek
life
,
critics
are
effectively
telling
hundreds
of
students
that
their
way
of
life
is
unacceptable
.
As
seen
at
schools
like
Georgetown
University
,
the
presence
of
exclusive
social
organizations
will
not
go
away
if
they
are
banned
from
campus
.
Rather
,
they
will
likely
isolate
themselves
further
from
university
affairs
as
they
continue
to
exist
in
a
way
that
is
unaffiliated
with
the
school
.
As
a
result
of
these
groups
moving
off
the
campus
,
a
university
has
less
oversight
of
their
activities
,
which
increases
safety
risks
and
jeopardizes
efforts
to
improve
diversity
.
Many
Greek
life
critics
also
seem
to
forget
about
the
natural
process
of
selectivity
and
the
liberty
of
people
to
associate
.
The
purpose
of
SLGs
are
to
foster
camaraderie
and
facilitate
the
process
for
those
with
similar
personalities
and
interests
to
form
a
community
.
nbsp
;
Even
without
the
letters
,
it
is
likely
that
they
would
form
friend
groups
that
reflect
these
similarities
.
More
importantly
,
selectivity
is
a
reality
of
life
and
dictates
everything
from
career
outcomes
to
personal
relationships
.
Without
selectivity
,
Duke
would
not
have
its
prestige
,
the
men’s
basketball
team
would
be
a
train
wreck
,
and
it
would
difficult
to
find
a
community
.
Although
selectivity
understandably
causes
some
to
feel
a
sense
of
rejection
,
no
one
is
entitled
to
a
bid
just
like
no
one
is
entitled
to
admission
or
a
roster
spot
.
Many
people
are
rightfully
concerned
about
how
students
with
low
socioeconomic
status
can
feel
unwelcome
in
Greek
life
given
the
considerable
financial
commitment
and
abundance
of
privileged
students
.
In
my
fraternity
,
brothers
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
dues
are
allowed
to
anonymously
be
a
non
paying
member
and
still
have
the
same
access
to
activities
and
events
.
While
dues
are
necessary
for
our
social
,
philanthropic
and
brotherhood
events
,
this
is
not
what
we
pride
ourselves
on
as
an
organization
and
would
never
exclude
someone
because
of
their
inability
to
pay
exorbitant
amounts
of
money
for
a
social
life
.
Furthermore
,
scholarship
programs
can
help
students
meet
this
financial
commitment
.
Although
I
can
only
speak
directly
from
my
own
experience
with
AEPi
,
I'm
sure
that
most
,
if
not
all
,
fraternities
and
sororities
on
campus
have
similar
mechanisms
.
Human
beings
constantly
seek
community
and
a
sense
of
belonging
.
Greek
life
is
ultimately
a
product
of
this
,
and
destroying
it
will
not
prevent
people
from
choosing
whom
they
want
to
associate
with
.
Instead
of
eradicating
a
social
system
that
works
for
a
large
portion
of
Duke
students
,
we
should
look
for
ways
to
provide
students
with
a
greater
variety
and
number
of
options
in
terms
of
social
and
selective
living
organizations
.
In
addition
,
students
that
genuinely
nbsp
;
desire
to
be
independent
should
be
provided
with
more
effective
programming
and
social
activities
that
strengthen
peer
relationships
and
promote
community
building
.
The
solution
to
bridging
Duke’s
social
divide
is
not
to
reform
housing
and
destroy
communities
.
It’s
nonsensical
to
displace
hundreds
of
students
who
have
established
identity
,
stability
,
and
a
sense
of
community
that
provides
comfort
and
pride
.
Rather
,
we
should
try
to
help
the
rest
of
the
student
body
,
that
currently
feels
displaced
,
to
attain
a
similar
situation

Greek
life
and
other
forms
of
selective
living
are
by
no
means
perfect
.
As
recent
events
have
demonstrated
,
hazing
is
certainly
an
issue
that
plagues
Greek
organizations
.
Actions
that
demoralize
,
degrade
and
attack
the
dignity
of
others
should
not
be
condoned
or
sanctioned
on
a
college
campus
.
Instances
of
sexual
assault
are
an
intensely
serious
and
disturbing
issue
as
well
.
Although
present
,
this
issue
is
unfortunately
not
unique
to
Greek
life
,
and
is
something
that
societies
across
the
world
are
struggling
with
.
Thus
,
we
should
not
encourage
a
prejudice
against
Greek
organizations
,
especially
when
an
overwhelmingly
majority
of
its
members
are
vehemently
opposed
to
,
and
are
trying
their
hardest
to
combat
,
these
egregious
acts
.
In
fact
,
IFC
mandates
that
fraternities
inform
guests
about
three
or
more
sober
brothers
at
every
party
who
are
there
to
monitor
and
manage
risk
.
Fraternities
are
also
required
to
have
have
proactive
educational
training
from
the
Women’s
Center
and
DuWell
.
Furthermore
,
each
individual
has
a
unique
character
,
and
thus
,
it
is
unfair
to
taint
their
reputation
due
to
the
unfortunate
actions
of
one
of
their
peers
.
As
the
leader
of
AEPi
,
I
share
many
of
these
concerns
myself
,
AEPi
President
Aaron
Slutkin
said
to
me
.
The
problem
with
the
dialogue
regarding
Greek
life
is
that
IFC
,
an
incredibly
diverse
organization
with
diverse
groups
,
is
painted
with
one
brush
.
I
would
invite
people
to
get
know
every
organization
before
making
one
size
fits
all
judgements
.
Students
in
Greek
life
are
still
students
who
want
to
engage
with
everything
Duke
has
to
offer
and
succeed
academically
,
professionally
and
socially
.
They
have
found
a
sense
of
belonging
.
And
quite
frankly
,
they
are
not
interested
in
exclusion
for
the
sake
of
exclusion
,
but
rather
to
build
a
community
where
they
can
thrive
.
Despite
its
flaws
,
Greek
life
and
selective
living
works
as
a
whole
.
Rather
than
condemning
it
,
Duke
should
get
creative
and
loosely
base
the
rest
of
its
social
scene
off
the
model
.
I
speak
for
the
vast
majority
of
my
fellow
Greeks
in
saying
that
I
would
like
nothing
more
than
to
see
the
rest
of
my
classmates
achieve
the
same
sense
of
community
that
AEPi
has
provided
me
.
I’m
writing
to
express
my
concern
that
Duke
has
not
yet
signed
a
cooperative
agreement
with
GoTriangle
and
is
putting
the
light
rail
transit
project
at
risk
.
In
addition
,
I’d
like
to
address
the
complaints
of
some
local
opponents
,
who
question
the
cost
and
the
benefits
of
this
project
for
our
community
.
The
North
Carolina
Department
of
Transportation
has
a
5
billion
annual
budget
,
yet
no
one
questions
our
ongoing
commitment
to
building
roads
,
fostering
dependence
on
cars
,
and
creating
more
air
pollution
from
vehicle
emissions
.
Air
pollution
is
a
major
cause
of
heart
and
lung
diseases
,
including
cancer
,
asthma
and
bronchitis
.
Some
of
the
populations
most
at
risk
for
health
problems
caused
by
air
pollution
are
infants
and
children
,
adults
over
65
,
and
people
living
in
poverty
,
without
access
to
health
care
.
Investing
in
our
transit
infrastructure
reduces
the
burden
of
disease
in
our
community
and
improves
access
to
health
care
.
Isn’t
that
what
Duke
and
Duke
Health
want
for
the
place
they
call
home
?
The
UN
special
report
on
global
warming
indicated
we
can
mitigate
climate
change
by
reducing
energy
demand
,
in
part
by
getting
people
out
of
cars
and
onto
buses
and
trains
.
Light
rail
supports
the
compact
growth
and
economic
development
strategies
of
Durham
and
Orange
counties
that
preserve
rural
buffers
and
reduce
emissions
.
Coupling
this
with
transit
oriented
development
will
allow
more
people
to
travel
shorter
distances
,
using
more
efficient
modes
of
transit
.
The
increase
in
extreme
,
deadly
weather
events
has
shown
us
what
climate
change
can
do
.
We
have
an
opportunity
to
fight
climate
change
and
make
a
huge
difference
at
the
local
level
.
I
encourage
Duke
to
continue
their
tradition
of
investing
in
Durham
by
signing
the
cooperative
agreement
and
keeping
this
project
on
track
.
The
Chronicle's
Editorial
Board
recently
published
an
editorial
in
response
to
recent
current
events
involving
Democratic
congresswoman
Ilhan
Omar
and
her
insensitive
tweets
about
Israel
.
While
the
article
must
inevitably
take
a
partisan
position
in
reviewing
this
matter
,
and
defending
the
congresswoman
is
no
crime
in
itself
,
I
was
shocked
,
disappointed
and
offended
by
the
article's
blatant
purveyance
of
anti
Semitism
.
One
can
recognize
the
validity
of
one
of
the
overlying
points
of
this
piece
that
anti
Zionism
need
not
,
and
often
should
not
,
be
synonymous
with
anti
Semitism
.
However
,
in
condemning
Israel
and
vastly
oversimplifying
possibly
the
most
complex
geopolitical
conflict
in
the
history
of
the
world
,
The
Editorial
Board
demonstrates
its
use
of
anti
Zionism
as
a
veil
for
underlying
sentiments
of
anti
Semitism
.
The
Editorial
Board's
inclusion
of
statistics
solely
pertaining
to
Palestinian
suffering
not
only
fails
to
consider
the
complexities
of
the
conflict
by
completely
ignoring
the
other
side
,
but
it
is
also
a
prime
example
of
irresponsible
journalism
in
an
age
where
fake
news
has
become
a
common
refrain
from
both
sides
.
Nowhere
in
the
article
is
there
any
mention
of
the
1
,
119
rockets
and
mortars
launched
into
Israeli
civilian
areas
this
past
year
,
the
13
tunnels
discovered
in
2018
that
had
been
dug
by
Hamas
under
Israel’s
borders
in
hopes
of
capturing
and
holding
Israeli
soldiers
for
ransom
,
Hamas'
propensity
to
launch
rockets
from
hospitals
and
schools
where
they
use
their
own
Palestinian
people
as
human
shields
,
etc
.
However
,
many
people
are
used
to
one
sided
reporting
surrounding
this
conflict
,
so
while
irresponsible
,
it
alone
is
not
enough
to
warrant
claims
of
anti
Semitism
.
The
characterization
of
Israeli
policies
toward
Palestinians
as
settler
colonialist
is
inflammatory
and
historically
problematic
in
its
own
right
.
On
the
other
hand
,
invoking
characterizations
of
Israeli
policy
as
murderous
and
genocidal
,
along
with
the
article’s
blatant
implication
that
Israel
is
somehow
responsible
for
contributing
to
racism
and
murder
of
black
people
in
America
,
is
beyond
offensive
.
It
is
anti
Semitic
propaganda
that
is
unworthy
of
this
university
and
its
wonderfully
diverse
student
body
.
It
has
also
come
to
my
attention
that
there
is
not
a
single
Jewish
member
of
the
Editorial
Board
.
This
point
is
perhaps
the
most
problematic
part
about
the
piece’s
publication
.
Put
simply
,
it
is
totally
illegitimate
for
a
group
of
non
Jewish
individuals
to
define
anti
Semitism
for
the
rest
of
us
.
It
is
shameful
and
offensive
that
the
board
believes
it
has
the
right
to
decide
what
does
and
does
not
constitute
anti
Semitism
.
I
hope
everyone
,
regardless
of
religion
or
ideology
,
can
recognize
why
it
is
entirely
inappropriate
and
unacceptable
for
a
group
that
has
never
been
subjected
to
anti
Semitism
to
dictate
the
terms
of
Jewish
suffering
.
It
is
unfortunate
,
but
when
people
are
so
misinformed
or
uninformed
altogether
this
is
the
outcome
.
I
have
had
the
opportunity
to
visit
Israel
several
times
over
the
course
of
my
life
.
While
I
was
there
,
I
spoke
often
with
soldiers
who
were
preparing
to
enter
the
military
for
mandatory
service
while
many
of
their
18
year
old
counterparts
in
America
were
preparing
to
head
off
to
college
.
I
have
also
had
the
opportunity
to
stand
in
the
gas
chambers
at
Dachau
where
countless
Jews
were
murdered
just
for
being
different
;
just
for
being
Jewish
.
These
experiences
underscore
how
,
while
the
future
of
Israel
is
and
has
always
been
a
deeply
divisive
issue
,
emotion
and
politics
should
never
be
enough
to
justify
discrimination
.
Unfortunately
,
the
shooting
at
the
Pittsburgh
Tree
of
Life
synagogue
this
past
fall
is
just
one
of
many
recent
reminders
that
anti
Semitism
is
alive
and
well
in
both
America
and
the
world
.
Therefore
,
we
must
do
our
part
to
combat
this
baseless
hatred
here
at
Duke
.
Our
university
and
its
Jewish
community
deserve
better
.
The
halls
of
private
schools
aren’t
remotely
hallowed
.
After
walking
them
for
13
years
,
I
should
know
.
In
fact
,
they
were
far
from
it
they
gave
structure
to
the
confusion
and
hopelessness
that
categorized
my
experience
in
what
,
by
its
own
claim
,
is
an
elite
preparatory
school
.
While
I
still
appreciate
the
fact
that
I
had
some
academic
opportunities
that
many
aren’t
afforded
,
I
look
back
on
them
as
being
relatively
small
compared
to
the
immense
,
suffocating
pressures
implicit
within
the
broader
society
of
which
my
school
was
a
member
.
My
school
was
a
place
of
extreme
conformity
visibly
enforced
by
rules
such
as
a
uniform
probably
why
I
will
never
wear
khakis
again
and
by
the
fear
culture
that
we
placed
on
anyone
remotely
different
than
us
.
I
,
for
one
,
was
constantly
terrified
nbsp
;
because
I
didn’t
exactly
fit
the
mold
of
other
boys
at
my
school
.
t
The
fact
that
I
loved
art
,
reading
and
music
,
and
didn’t
particularly
care
if
the
Jets
were
0
16
in
a
given
year
seemed
to
me
as
being
not
personal
assets
,
but
massive
liabilities
that
would
bring
about
surefire
castigation
or
ostracization
if
anyone
else
found
out
.
But
the
currents
of
conformity
ran
deeper
than
just
people
being
particularly
nasty
to
assumed
outsiders
it
included
a
pervasive
code
of
behavior
that
,
from
my
perspective
,
undermined
any
claim
to
meritocracy
or
any
value
in
achievement
.
Most
of
us
,
myself
included
,
indulged
ourselves
in
creating
images
of
incredible
excess
,
of
bragging
about
how
much
money
we
could
spend
on
our
parents’
credit
cards
,
without
ever
remotely
putting
on
a
façade
of
working
or
wanting
to
contribute
to
society
in
any
way
.
I
bought
into
that
culture
halfheartedly
and
hypocritically
I
spent
thousands
of
dollars
on
clothes
after
I
was
called
a
peasant
for
turning
down
the
wrong
street
walking
home
.
Yet
I
always
felt
that
what
I
was
doing
was
just
wrong
.
It
was
social
meanings
we
attached
to
success
,
however
,
that
most
acutely
distressed
me
.
They
stemmed
from
two
ideas
.
First
was
the
notion
that
the
world
was
a
zero
sum
game
and
that
one
only
did
well
by
life
with
no
real
idea
what
that
is
.
Duke
,
while
it
may
be
far
more
diverse
and
normal’
than
where
I
came
from
,
has
taught
me
that
my
vague
notion
of
normalcy
still
may
not
exist
.

that
spread
like
wildfire
across
social
media
,
it
was
for
many
of
our
generation
a
first
brush
with
activism
and
advocacy
.
Though
the
film
has
since
been
criticized
for
oversimplification
of
the
complex
issues
,
promotion
of
slacktivism
,
and
even
some
misinformation
,
its
accessible
form
also
undoubtedly
led
to
an
exponential
increase
in
general
awareness
of
the
issue
,
and
even
awareness
of
activism
itself
.
However
,
there’s
a
difference
between
making
activism
accessible
and
simply
allowing
people
to
avoid
uncomfortable
action
.
Buying
an
I
love
boobies
bracelet
doesn’t
do
much
to
cure
breast
cancer
.
And
beyond
uncomfortable
action
,
it’s
first
and
foremost
about
action
.
Of
the
495
,
969
that
The
Keep
A
Breast
Foundation
raised
in
2008
,
only
6
,
723
went
to
breast
cancer
awards
and
grants
.
Yet
,
it’s
easy
to
slip
into
these
forms
of
slacktivism
;
they’re
safe
and
yet
you
often
still
receive
the
glory
of
being
woke
.
Junior
Tyler
Lian
,
current
vice
president
of
the
Asian
Students
Association
,
said
to
me
,
there’s
this
conflation
of
wokeness
where
people
label
themselves
as
activists
and
then
forget
that
to
be
an
activist
,
you
actually
have
to
act
and
organize
.
Today
,
I’m
thinking
of
the
members
of
Duke’s
Afro
American
society
who
occupied
the
Allen
building
50
years
ago
in
demand
of
increased
support
and
protection
for
black
students
,
who
faced
tear
gas
from
police
.
I’m
thinking
of
the
students
who
,
in
2016
,
similarly
occupied
the
Allen
building
to
protest
Tallman
Trask
III
,
and
were
threatened
with
disciplinary
action
.
I’m
also
thinking
of
the
students
who
,
more
recently
,
took
the
stage
in
front
of
hundreds
of
alumni
to
demand
administrative
action
from
President
Price
.
As
the
corporate
world
says
,
Big
risk
,
big
reward
.
.
.
and
in
institutions
like
Duke
,
sometimes
we
are
forced
to
take
these
risks
just
to
get
basic
acknowledgement
.
When
they’re
not
taking
place
on
our
campus
though
,
protests
can
often
feel
removed
from
our
daily
lives
we
all
acknowledge
that
Duke
is
a
bubble
.
Maybe
that’s
why
I’ve
had
multiple
conversations
with
students
here
where
they
rationalize
political
apathy
with
the
amount
of
schoolwork
they
have
.
This
doesn’t
sit
quite
right
with
me
;
the
whole
idea
seems
counterintuitive
.
When
I
ask
people
why
they
want
to
be
,
the
universal
sentiment
is
always
Because
I
want
to
help
people
.
So
,
we
study
for
these
exams
and
write
these
papers
so
that
eventually
we
can
graduate
and
adopt
those
professional
roles
.
But
if
our
mission
is
ultimately
to
help
people
,
why
not
start
now
?
Lindsay
Ayling
,
a
graduate
student
at
UNC
Chapel
Hill
who
has
played
an
active
role
in
the
movement
to
remove
Silent
Sam
,
addressed
this
idea
in
the
context
of
the
history
department
at
UNC
when
she
spoke
with
me
.
A
lot
of
historians
study
social
issues
,
like
racism
or
sexism
or
fascism
,
she
said
.
And
I
don’t
know
how
you
can
study
those
issues
without
also
realizing
the
incredibly
high
stakes
and
feel
a
call
to
oppose
violent
ideologies
in
your
own
time
.
I
admire
the
labor
and
bravery
of
activists
,
protestors
,
and
organizers
greatly
.
I
also
acknowledge
that
the
activism
space
can
be
intimidating
.
I
haven’t
been
as
involved
with
student
activism
on
campus
as
I
want
to
be
,
but
something
I’m
learning
now
as
I
get
more
involved
is
that
it
shouldn’t
be
so
intimidating
.
We
can
all
think
of
tons
of
reasons
why
we’d
feel
uncomfortable
with
protests
and
activism
in
general
.
I
know
I’m
definitely
not
eager
to
put
myself
in
a
position
where
I’m
given
trespass
notices
or
arrested
or
have
even
more
severe
actions
taken
against
me
.
But
when
it
comes
down
to
it
,
those
who
attend
protests
don’t
do
so
because
they’re
not
also
afraid
of
the
repercussions
.
.
.
they
do
so
because
their
anger
and
proximity
to
the
issue
outweigh
their
fear
.
These
people
who
do
show
up
often
tend
to
be
people
of
color
or
first
generation
,
low
income
students
,
who
often
have
so
much
more
at
stake
.
When
people
don’t
get
involved
with
activism
in
its
varying
forms
there’s
more
to
it
than
just
protests
,
it’s
not
simply
because
activism
itself
is
uncomfortable
it’s
the
act
of
confronting
your
own
privilege
and
your
own
complicity
that
is
the
true
source
of
discomfort
.
This
also
implies
that
if
you
are
physically
able
to
participate
in
these
demonstrations
,
it
is
all
the
more
reason
for
you
to
actually
do
so
.
Ayling
spoke
to
this
privilege
It
is
much
more
of
a
risk
for
non
white
people
to
counter
protest
so
I
would
never
judge
somebody
who
wouldn’t
come
to
a
counter
demonstration
.

As
a
result
,
those
who
are
capable
ought
to
step
up
.
In
the
case
of
efforts
to
remove
Silent
Sam
,
it
was
people
who
did
not
have
as
large
of
a
reason
to
fear
white
nationalists
at
demonstrations
as
their
black
peers
.
Ayling
said
,
white
academics
have
a
duty
to
oppose
white
supremacy
on
the
streets
if
they
can
.
We’re
nearing
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
first
Allen
building
sit
in
,
and
I’m
already
beginning
to
see
flyers
for
commemoration
events
.
This
university
tends
to
celebrate
activism
from
a
distance
,
making
it
more
palatable
to
the
institution
that
fights
it
when
it
is
actually
taking
place
.
Just
two
weekends
ago
,
I
was
struck
by
the
irony
that
the
same
people
so
excited
to
see
speakers
invited
for
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
.
Day
also
call
protests
today
futile
and
disruptive
.
Protests
were
never
made
for
institutions
that
prioritize
law
and
order
.
It's
impossible
for
protest
to
be
popular
in
these
spaces
.
Yet
,
this
university’s
history
was
shaped
by
protest
itself
,
and
we
are
far
from
being
finished
.
The
proposed
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
would
have
stops
near
Duke
University
Medical
Center
and
on
Ninth
Street
.
Duke
has
days
to
decide
whether
to
move
forward
with
light
rail
.
Without
Duke
,
Durham
will
not
have
an
efficient
transit
system
to
help
Duke
students
,
employees
and
all
residents
share
in
Durham’s
prosperity
.
If
Duke
does
nothing
,
more
cars
will
make
more
traffic
jams
.
Buses
will
keep
trying
to
squeeze
through
congested
roads
to
and
from
our
downtown
station
.
People
will
wait
at
parking
lots
hoping
to
get
to
work
on
time
.
Who
loses
,
if
we
do
nothing
?

employee
who
can
barely
afford
to
keep
a

and

More
than
20

On

residents

will
need
to
drive
more
.
What
can
Duke
do
?
Support
light
rail
as
the
backbone
of
an
efficient
transit
system
.
People
can
hop
on
light
rail
,
instead
of
sitting
in
traffic
jams
.
A
Duke
employee
can
catch
a
cross
town
bus
at
any
light
rail
station
,
instead
of
waiting
at
a
parking
lot
.
Duke
is
already
investing
in
affordable
housing
.
Transit
is
the
other
investment
that
will
improve
economic
opportunities
for
all
of
us
.
Affordable
housing
in
development
around
every
transit
station
allows
Durham
residents
of
all
incomes
to
live
just
a
short
walk
to
transit
.
Now’s
the
time
to
talk
with
Duke
leaders
.
We
need
to
invest
in
light
rail
,
buses
,
and
affordable
housing
.
Then
all
of
us
can
live
and
prosper
in
Durham
.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
dialogue
at
Duke
University
.
There
exist
only
monologues
in
parallel
.
Consider
the
response
to
the
Editorial
Board’s
piece
on
AIPAC
.
The
Board
stepped
on
one
of
the
more
obvious
rakes
in
the
commentariat’s
backyard
addressing
a
geopolitical
gordian
knot
in
800
to
1
,
000
words
and
assuming
you’ve
contextualized
everything
there
is
to
contextualize
is
hardly
prudent
.
At
risk
of
my
own
overgeneralization
,
the
Board’s
refrain
was
settler
colonialism
a
term
they
never
bothered
to
define
.
This
can
mean
one
of
two
things
.
Hopefully
,
it
is
a
response
to
opinions
such
as
that
of
Danny
Danon
,
Israel’s
representative
at
the
UN
vote
on
Resolution
2334
2016
against
settlements
,
that
denying
Israel’s
claim
to
territory
beyond
its
own
borders
is
denying
Israel’s
right
to
exist
.
How
can
denying
Palestinian
land
to
Israel
infringe
on
Israel’s
right
to
exist
,
unless
it
is
assumed
that
there
is
no
Palestinian
land
but
only
Israeli
land
that
there
is
no
Palestinian
right
to
exist
?
However
,
the
Board
was
not
clear
enough
.
They
compared
Israeli
settler
colonialism
to
American
settler
colonialism
an
implication
being
that
someone’s
land
was
taken
and
the
current
occupants
have
no
claim
to
that
land
.
Throw
Zionist
in
the
mix
,
as
the
Board
did
,
and
members
of
a
people
whose
cultural
memory
includes
centuries
of
pogroms
,
and
the
Holocaust
,
had
ample
cause
to
believe
the
worst
.
So
far
as
the
piece
seemed
to
stray
into
anti
Semitism
,
that
far
did
five
separate
responses
criticize
it
.
This
exchange
was
many
things
.
It
was
also
the
closest
we
as
a
community
have
come
to
actual
dialogue
in
a
very
long
time
.
Consider
the
theme
in
some
responses
.
The
line
separating
valid
criticism
and
anti
Semitism
,
writes
Doron
Ezickson
of
the
Anti
Defamation
League
,
nbsp
;
is
crossed
just
in
case
Israel’s
fundamental
legitimacy
as
a
Jewish
state
on
the
historic
home
of
the
Jewish
people
is
denied
.
We
were
so
close
to
dialogue
.
The
Editorial
Board
should
have
responded
and
cleaned
up
its
definitional
quagmire
.
Then
we
could
have
further
concretized
the
line
between
principled
criticism
and
prejudice
.
We
could
have
worked
from
mutual
understanding
to
constructive
progress
.
But
this
did
not
happen
.
This
did
not
become
a
dialogue
.
This
remained
monologues
in
parallel
.
When
I
say
that
we
waste
scandals
,
I
mean
that
we
fail
to
make
a
bad
thing
as
little
bad
as
we
can
.
We
fail
to
redeem
the
one
thing
we
could
a
better
understanding
of
who
we
are
,
and
who
we
want
to
be
,
as
a
community
.
It
is
not
enough
to
know
who
we
are
not
.
We
must
know
who
we
are
.
It
is
not
enough
to
know
what
we
reject
.
We
must
know
what
we
dream
of
.
This
time
,
we
came
very
close
to
redeeming
that
one
good
thing
.
We
recognized
what
was
problematic
.
We
defined
the
issue
to
discuss
.
But
this
is
the
exception
,
not
the
rule
.
We
are
content
to
recognize
the
problem
and
consider
our
work
to
be
over
.
In
the
wake
of
each
new
hate
and
bias
incident
,
which
further
marginalize
the
already
marginalized
members
of
our
community
,
we
call
for
a
hate
and
bias
policy
.
I
cannot
number
the
columns
I
have
read
that
are
700
words
proclaiming
a
problem
,
100
words
demanding
a
solution
,
and
no
exploration
of
what
that
solution
looks
like
.
How
does
that
help
the
victims
,
exactly
?
Consider
the
letter
and
petition
printed
on
Monday
in
support
of
the
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
.
A
smattering
of
student
groups
and
a
laundry
list
of
faculty
pressed
President
Price
to
do
X
for
reason
Y
.
But
how
many
of
these
have
actually
met
with
the
President
?
Or
met
with
local
stakeholders
in
this
process
?
Or
made
a
good
faith
effort
to
establish
dialogue
instead
of
shouting
their
moral
position
into
the
ether
and
expecting
someone
else
to
realize
it
?
We
can’t
even
have
a
proper
discussion
on
housing
reform
.
Hardly
scandalous
,
yet
hard
to
talk
about
.
We
shouldn’t
be
surprised
that
change
does
not
happen
when
our
discourse
never
passes
the
one
side
shouting
,
It’s
broken
,
and
the
other
shouting
back
,
It
isn’t
.

When
a
strong
community
has
a
disagreement
,
they
come
together
and
work
through
it
.
We
say
our
piece
and
leave
.
We
the
Undersigned
decide
Our
Position
,
give
our
chests
an
emphatic
thump
,
throw
our
demands
onto
some
webpage
or
other
,
and
wait
for
the
person
we
address
to
bend
.
Rarely
do
we
make
a
continued
mutual
engagement
of
constructive
challenges
and
responses
.
Is
this
the
Duke
Difference
?
We
scrounge
up
the
ever
ballooning
cost
of
tuition
to
let
someone
else
do
our
thinking
for
us
?
We
are
really
so
able
to
confuse
one
unanswered
statement
with
a
meaningful
contribution
to
an
ongoing
discussion
?
We
should
not
confuse
the
performance
of
outrage
with
the
construction
of
something
better
.
While
that
is
not
what
happened
this
last
week
,
it
is
what
happens
most
other
weeks
.
If
we
want
to
build
a
stronger
community
,
we
begin
by
building
a
stronger
discourse
.
Do
not
be
content
with
what
I
am
against
.
Find
out
what
I
am
for
.
If
you
disagree
with
someone
,
challenge
them
.
Understand
why
you
disagree
.
Stretch
your
conversations
to
something
of
greater
moment
than
how
hard
that
midterm
was
.
Let
iron
sharpen
iron
and
avail
yourself
of
all
that
Duke
diversity
you
came
here
to
experience
.
Will
we
have
to
engage
with
people
whom
we
find
distasteful
?
Yes
.
Either
we
bring
them
to
better
views
or
leave
them
to
ferment
in
their
resentment
and
then
,
they
shall
do
worse
than
words
and
words
will
not
stop
them
.
Should
the
burden
of
this
engagement
rest
on
those
already
marginalized
?
Absolutely
not
.
It
is
time
for
Duke’s
allies
to
see
some
action
.
If
it
is
a
problem
in
this
community
,
is
is
absolutely
your
problem
.
This
piece
began
with
a
discussion
of
a
problem
in
the
Holy
Land
.
It
ends
with
a
cautionary
tale
from
the
Scripture
which
all
claimants
to
the
Holy
Land
share
.
The
Tower
of
Babel
,
where
one
people
are
rent
into
many
by
their
inability
to
understand
one
another
,
is
a
story
about
many
things
.
One
of
these
is
how
language
can
divide
.
Unless
we
understand
each
other
,
unless
we
communicate
and
resolve
our
disagreements
,
unless
we
take
responsibility
for
the
reality
of
discourse
instead
of
the
pretense
of
dialogue
,
we
will
never
be
all
that
we
can
.
We
move
forward
together
or
not
at
all
.
When
next
there
is
a
problem
,
let’s
actually
talk
about
it
.
Students
head
over
to
Perkins
,
ready
for
a
long
night
of
studying
.
I
feel
immensely
guilty
when
I’m
not
being
productive
.
Even
when
I’m
choosing
to
do
something
fun
,
or
putting
my
work
down
because
I
know
I
need
a
break
,
I
can’t
seem
to
shake
the
feeling
that
I’m
wasting
my
life
away
.
This
is
not
a
unique
sentiment
at
Duke
.
Everyone
here
is
obsessed
with
productivity
.
When
we’re
overwhelmed
,
we
add
another
item
to
our
to
do
lists
.
The
feeling
that
you’re
never
doing
enough
is
utterly
unavoidable
.
Whenever
I
manage
to
look
beyond
my
responsibilities
here
at
Duke
,
I’m
reminded
constantly
of
their
burdens
by
a
distant
nagging
in
the
back
of
my
head
,
the
voice
of
my
anxiety
battering
me
for
my
unproductivity
.
This
is
a
voice
we
all
have
,
and
we’ve
trained
ourselves
to
obey
it
because
it
has
allowed
us
to
reap
superficial
rewards
.
Good
grades
,
leadership
positions
and
job
offers
usually
manifest
when
we
convince
ourselves
that
we
should
always
be
doing
more
.
These
rewards
are
appealing
,
sure
.
But
we
can
have
all
of
these
things
and
remain
unfulfilled
.
Many
of
us
do
.
In
our
heads
,
productivity
means
completing
menial
assignments
,
scheduling
meetings
and
putting
in
hours
of
studying
in
Perkins
.
We
struggle
to
convert
our
lives
into
products
that
we
can
hand
in
or
show
off
for
a
shred
of
recognition
.
But
in
doing
so
,
we
waste
most
of
our
time
and
emotional
energy
trying
to
wrap
ourselves
into
these
pretty
packages
.
Then
,
we
sell
ourselves
for
much
less
than
we
are
worth
,
feeding
into
systems
more
consumed
with
goods
and
services
than
with
our
humanity
.
This
cycle
is
almost
impossible
to
escape
because
we
have
been
raised
into
a
market
culture
.
Our
society
defines
success
narrowly
,
in
terms
of
what
you
can
produce
and
what
you
can
gain
in
return
specifically
,
fame
and
fortune
.
These
appear
to
be
the
only
forms
of
currency
worth
seeking
.
But
how
valuable
are
they
really
?
Today
,
we
conceive
of
success
as
the
result
of
intelligence
and
hard
work
,
especially
in
high
paying
fields
.
But
hundreds
of
years
ago
,
success
had
nothing
to
do
with
how
smart
or
dedicated
you
were
.
It
was
determined
by
your
ancestry
and
property
inheritance
.
Before
that
,
being
successful
meant
you
were
a
capable
hunter
and
protector
.
For
women
,
success
has
had
dozens
of
rigid
definitions
,
many
of
which
were
related
to
their
perceived
ability
to
bear
children
.
It’s
fair
to
say
that
most
of
these
qualities
hold
minimal
weight
in
today’s
society
.
But
in
the
same
way
,
what
success
looks
like
today
is
unlikely
to
resemble
what
success
looks
like
hundreds
of
years
from
now
.
The
tasks
you’re
slaving
over
may
be
completely
inconsequential
to
future
generations
.
Point
being
our
definition
of
success
is
arbitrary
,
as
are
the
divisions
between
what
is
productive
and
what
is
not
.
Those
parameters
are
controlled
by
society
.
They
are
not
inherent
.
Let’s
get
one
thing
straight
You
are
not
a
product
.
Your
life
is
not
the
sum
of
the
bullet
points
on
your
resume
.
You
were
not
built
to
conform
to
society’s
constructs
.
These
frameworks
in
which
we
live
are
ephemeral
.
They
only
hold
as
much
meaning
as
you
give
them
.
But
you
your
happiness
,
your
wellbeing
,
your
fulfillment
those
are
fundamentally
valuable
.
Those
are
the
things
that
matter
.
I’m
not
saying
you
should
drop
out
of
school
and
try
to
run
away
from
the
reality
we’re
embedded
in
.
Attending
this
university
is
a
privilege
.
But
the
real
privilege
isn’t
in
the
jobs
we
might
secure
after
graduation
it’s
the
opportunity
to
make
ourselves
into
whoever
we
want
to
be
.
There
are
bigger
things
to
learn
here
than
how
to
make
it
to
Wall
Street
.
Even
though
society’s
arbitrary
definitions
of
success
and
productivity
seem
to
control
our
every
move
now
,
they
don’t
have
to
.
We
can
lead
lives
that
are
meaningful
by
our
own
standards
instead
of
someone
else’s
.

As
much
as
I
worry
about
working
harder
,
all
I
ultimately
want
is
to
be
happy
and
to
help
other
people
be
happy
.
I
don’t
care
how
I
get
there
.
I’d
rather
wake
up
on
my
70th
birthday
with
a
feeling
of
fulfillment
than
with
a
three
page
CV
.
West
Campus
dorms
are
divided
between
independent
houses
and
sections
for
fraternities
,
sororities
and
selective
living
groups
.
Duke
housing
should
be
more
selective
.
I
know
that’s
a
hot
take
,
but
it’s
also
the
truth
.
I
don’t
mean
more
,
mind
you
the
last
thing
I
want
is
more
people
turned
away
from
groups
they
want
to
be
in
.
I
mean
more
,
as
in
more
people
selecting
groups
to
live
with
and
more
groups
selecting
people
to
live
with
.
There
is
a
housing
crisis
at
Duke
,
and
I
am
not
just
referring
to
the
current
shortages
.
The
dorm
living
experience
for
a
large
portion
of
Duke
students
is
nothing
short
of
isolating
,
and
I
think
many
independent
students
would
agree
.
By
making
the
housing
decision
a
mutual
process
in
which
a
student
chooses
a
group
and
the
group
chooses
them
back
,
selective
living
creates
a
built
in
community
from
the
outset
.
I
appreciate
that
I
can
walk
down
the
hall
of
my
fraternity
section
and
open
the
door
to
any
room
just
to
have
a
quick
chat
with
the
people
inside
.
Meanwhile
,
my
independent
friend
who
lives
on
West
Campus
would
be
hard
pressed
to
name
a
single
person
on
his
hall
,
let
alone
the
last
time
he
talked
to
one
of
them
.
My
friends
in
SLGs
and
other
fraternities
have
no
such
problem
,
and
the
same
goes
for
my
friends
from
first
year
who
took
advantage
of
blocking
with
their
East
Campus
dorm
.
The
process
of
making
housing
selection
an
active
decision
on
behalf
of
the
student
creates
the
community
oriented
mindset
that
is
so
valuable
in
making
a
close
knit
dorm
a
possibility
.
However
,
this
is
not
a
problem
that
can
be
solved
by
a
Duke
mandate
or
some
housing
policy
change
.
It
as
much
a
Duke
cultural
issue
as
it
is
an
administrative
one
.
A
big
part
of
the
Duke
student
population
is
competitive
and
achievement
oriented
in
other
words
,
many
Duke
students
have
tied
selective
living
into
a
signal
of
social
status
or
a
way
to
validate
their
self
worth
.
Sites
like
GreekRank
and
the
way
that
rush
has
gamified
the
process
of
finding
selective
living
only
serve
to
reinforce
this
notion
.
Too
many
people
at
Duke
refuse
to
consider
joining
groups
they
consider
inferior
for
some
reason
or
another
,
and
the
result
is
people
that
would
thrive
in
a
selective
living
environment
end
up
not
joining
any
.
Not
only
that
,
but
the
negative
perceptions
of
selective
living
have
soured
many
people
on
even
seeking
it
out
in
the
first
place
they
see
selectivity
as
exclusivity
instead
of
a
way
to
form
community
.
As
Reiss
Becker
pointed
out
in
his
most
recent
column
,
community
cannot
contain
everyone
without
losing
meaning
.
Selective
living
is
a
way
of
formalizing
the
community
forming
dynamics
that
occur
naturally
in
most
circumstances
,
but
are
increasingly
failing
to
work
at
Duke
.
This
is
not
a
Duke
specific
issue
there
is
less
and
less
community
oriented
behavior
across
America
as
it
becomes
easier
to
stay
at
home
than
go
out
and
interact
with
others
see
Robert
D
.
Putnam’s
Bowling
Alone
for
an
analysis
of
this
issue
.
If
we
want
to
reverse
that
trend
at
Duke
,
I
believe
selective
living
is
the
way
to
go
about
it
.
I
don’t
mean
that
Duke
should
charter
20
more
fraternities
or
double
the
rush
classes
for
organizations
.
Instead
,
I
think
a
few
changes
to
the
current
housing
structure
are
in
order
.
First
off
,
the
current
program
that
allows
blocking
by
first
year
dorm
is
brilliant
,
and
a
great
way
for
people
that
don’t
want
to
go
through
the
current
rush
process
to
stick
with
a
community
they
found
during
their
first
year
.
Second
,
I
think
Duke
should
work
with
certain
selective
groups
that
want
it
or
with
students
to
create
new
groups
in
order
to
create
an
effective
alternative
rush
system
that
is
more
focused
on
inclusivity
and
finding
the
right
group
for
each
student
than
the
current
exclusion
oriented
rush
system
with
cuts
and
rounds
.
Like
I
mentioned
above
,
I
see
the
selective
living
as
most
valuable
when
it
is
a
mutual
process
where
groups
and
students
find
each
other
to
maximize
the
community
.
It
is
also
difficult
and
somewhat
hypocritical
for
me
to
offer
my
thoughts
on
this
topic
,
since
I
am
a
member
of
a
relatively
exclusive
group
on
campus
.
As
a
member
of
a
fraternity
,
I
attended
rush
meetings
with
the
cuts
and
rounds
that
I
just
denounced
.
I
do
think
the
traditional
rush
process
has
some
value
it
is
,
as
I
said
above
,
simply
a
formalization
of
how
most
people
form
friendships
,
writ
large
to
include
a
whole
group
.
However
,
it
certainly
needs
restructuring
to
be
more
inclusive
and
to
ensure
that
every
student
that
wants
to
partake
in
selective
housing
can
end
up
in
a
group
that
fits
them
well
.
It
is
,
unfortunately
,
easy
to
say
that
and
incredibly
difficult
to
enact
such
a
policy
,
both
logistically
and
culturally
at
Duke
.
That
said
,
I
think
we
as
a
community
should
begin
to
reevaluate
how
we
think
view
selective
living
.
First
,
we
need
to
realize
that
it
a
good
thing
for
a
lot
of
students
;
second
,
that
it
ought
to
be
a
mutual
process
that
serves
both
the
group
and
the
student
;
and
third
,
that
if
we
don’t
do
something
,
the
decline
in
community
at
Duke
will
continue
unhindered
.
On
Oct
.
2
,
Kanye
West
tweeted
a
photo
of
sautéed
insects
captioned
,
My
dad
and
I
are
going
to
eat
this
plate
of
bugs
to
celebrate
him
beating
cancer
.
No
more
fear
.
The
picture
was
utterly
horrifying
.
No
,
nbsp
;
it’s
not
the
bugs
that
were
disgusting
.
It
was
the
plastic
to
go
box
holding
them
.
Plastics
undeniably
pose
a
profound
danger
to
our
environment
and
ourselves
.
A
conglomeration
of
hundreds
of
compounds
,
plastics
are
known
to
contain
molecules
that
interrupt
our
hormones
and
cause
cancer
,
in
addition
to
housing
numerous
unstudied
substances
.
Thankfully
,
more
and
more
organizations
are
trying
to
reduce
our
dependence
on
plastic
,
including
our
own
campus
.
In
July
,
Duke
University
slapped
a
campus
wide
ban
on
disposable
plastics
,
opting
for
containers
made
of
compostable
,
plant
based
material
.
And
in
September
,
Duke
Student
Government
went
further
,
approving
a
25
cent
responsible
diner
fee
on
disposable
containers
given
out
on
campus
,
aimed
at
encouraging
students
to
use
a
reusable
to
go
box
instead
.
By
the
start
of
the
school
year
,
vendors
were
using
to
go
boxes
made
of
sugarcane
fiber
.
We
got
disposable
utensils
labeled
Compostable
,
made
from
a
corn
based
plastic
called
polylactic
acid
,
or
PLA
.
We
are
on
track
to
receive
our
reusable
to
go
boxes
next
semester
.
It
seems
like
great
news
for
the
environment
all
around
,
right
?
Not
so
fast
.
The
manufacturer’s
description
of
the
PLA
fork
used
on
campus
reveals
that
it
is
compostable
in
commercial
compost
,
but
unfortunately
not
in
your
home
compost
.
This
warning
can
be
found
on
other
PLA
objects
at
Duke
.
Even
the
sugarcane
boxes
must
be
commercially
composted
in
order
to
turn
into
soil
.
Commercial
composting
involves
mixing
the
plant
based
containers
and
utensils
with
carbon
,
water
,
oxygen
,
and
nitrogen
.
Bacteria
also
play
an
important
role
,
munching
down
these
plastics
but
only
if
the
temperature
is
high
enough
often
as
high
as
160
degrees
.
This
special
environment
of
heat
,
gases
,
and
microbes
is
impossible
to
find
at
landfills
.
Turns
out
,
Duke’s
eco
friendly
products
are
actually
eco
friendly
only
if
they
find
their
way
to
a
home
with
some
very
specific
furniture
.
Unfortunately
,
the
waste
bins
around
Duke
only
take
our
trash
to
two
facilities
landfill
and
recycling
.
Neither
of
these
are
equipped
to
compost
our
new
eco
friendly
garbage
.
Disappointing
,
yes
,
but
at
least
we
can
fall
back
on
Duke’s
new
25
cent
tax
on
to
go
boxes
,
right
?
The
fee
should
deter
people
from
using
disposable
products
in
the
first
place
,
right
?
Sadly
,
this
too
is
a
bit
more
complicated
than
it
seems
.
The
reusable
to
go
container
may
not
be
as
environmentally
friendly
as
intended
.
A
Danish
study
found
that
reusable
cotton
bags
would
need
to
be
used
7
,
100
times
the
carbon
footprint
of
single
use
plastic
bag
!
Making
a
single
use
plastic
bag
requires
far
less
energy
and
produces
far
lower
carbon
dioxide
emissions
.
So
while
Duke’s
reusable
container
option
may
at
first
seem
like
an
obviously
better
alternative
to
single
use
containers
,
it’s
not
necessarily
so
.
Moreover
,
the
new
fee
is
what
economists
call
a
regressive
tax
it’s
hardest
on
the
people
who
have
the
least
money
.
On
a
campus
where
51
percent
of
the
student
population
is
on
financial
aid
,
that’s
a
big
problem
.
As
students
,
we
will
now
pay
to
eat
with
utensils
that
will
fail
just
as
miserably
as
what
we
were
using
before
annoying
for
everyone
,
but
a
major
burden
for
those
whose
families
are
cash
strapped
.
And
indefensible
when
an
actual
potential
solution
is
staring
us
in
the
face
.

Even
Kanye
tweeted
about
the
damage
plastics
can
do
before
mysteriously
deleting
his
Twitter
account
several
days
later
.
We
know
the
dangers
as
well
.
But
we
have
to
make
sure
that
what
we
choose
solutions
that
work
,
rather
than
theatrical
gestures
that
will
solve
nothing
while
financially
burdening
the
less
well
to
do
.
I
am
not
the
first
to
perceive
something
fundamentally
incomplete
about
how
Duke
is
approaching
eco
friendliness
.
And
unless
we
do
better
,
I
won’t
be
the
last
,
either
.
President
Price
,
for
seven
months
now
,
our
residential
housekeepers
have
been
unnecessarily
working
on
weekends
.
After
the
policy
change
,
housekeeping
staff
have
changed
to
an
alternating
schedule
of
working
seven
days
in
a
row
every
other
week
.
Also
a
result
of
the
schedule
change
,
only
half
of
their
teams
now
come
in
Thursday
through
Sunday
,
so
on
these
days
housekeepers
are
expected
to
perform
double
the
workload
for
the
same
pay
.
In
a
meeting
that
Duke
Students
and
Workers
Alliance
had
with
Housing
and
Residential
Life
,
administration
claimed
that
this
change
was
for
the
safety
of
students
.
However
,
based
on
the
results
of
our
petition
signed
by
over
1
,
000
people
last
fall
,
and
conversations
with
over
40
housekeepers
,
students
and
housekeepers
alike
say
there
was
no
problem
before
and
there
has
been
no
noticeable
change
in
building
cleanliness
after
the
policy
change
.
Not
only
is
this
policy
ineffective
,
but
it
is
also
hurting
our
housekeeping
staff
.
They
lose
time
with
their
families
,
cannot
attend
religious
services
,
are
unable
to
work
second
jobs
,
and
have
to
pay
for
childcare
on
the
weekends
.
This
exploitation
seems
unimaginable
.
Wake
up
,
Duke
.
The
Duke
Community
Standard
claims
that
we
are
dedicated
to
principles
of
respect
and
fairness
,
yet
these
policy
changes
are
a
blatant
disregard
of
these
very
principles
.
Put
yourself
in
the
shoes
of
our
housekeepers
.
Does
this
system
seem
respectful
or
fair
?
I
have
talked
to
countless
housekeepers
,
and
can
assure
you
that
it
is
not
.
Our
housekeepers
are
not
just
resources
.
They
provide
dignified
work
.
President
Price
,
I
encourage
you
to
re
evaluate
this
policy
.
In
your
inaugural
address
,
you
said
,
Our
new
century
calls
for
a
university
.
.
.
that
confronts
its
own
problems
as
readily
as
it
does
others
.
.
.
and
that
shows
its
most
generous
and
supportive
self
to
its
own
neighborhood
.
To
stay
true
to
this
goal
,
please
help
take
care
of
the
people
who
take
care
of
us
.
Open
Letter
to
Duke
Alumni
and
the
Durham
Community
Have
you
ever
noticed
how
billion
dollar
infrastructure
projects
often
live
or
die
according
to
the
ego
of
one
white
male
?
I
have
.
This
phenomenon
is
not
about
race
.
It's
about
how
power
prevents
its
holders
from
hearing
,
how
elitism
isolates
the
intellect
.
In
the
case
of
Dr
.
Vincent
Price
v
.
The
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
Transit
project
we
hope
for
better
things
.
We
hope
the
humility
of
humanity
will
prevail
.
Dr
.
Price
literally
wrote
the
book
on
public
opinion
.
nbsp
;
He
titled
it
nbsp
;
Public
Opinion
.
nbsp
;
In
nbsp
;
Public
Opinion
,
Price
explores
other
important
dialectics
between
social
stability
and
social
change
,
between
thought
and
action
,
nbsp
;
between
elite
and
mass
that
find
their
expression
,
if
not
their
resolution
,
in
the
concept
of
public
opinion
.
The
struggle
of
this
midnight
hour
is
yet
the
latest
chapter
in
the
long
history
of
Duke
Durham
relations
the
dialectic
nbsp
;
between
elite
and
mass
.
It
would
be
tragic
for
Dr
.
Price
earn
the
legacy
of
single
handedly
undoing
the
decade
of
work
that
the
late
Dr
.
Phail
Wynn
poured
his
life
into
the
difficult
and
unfinished
work
of
repairing
more
than
a
century
of
exploitation
inherent
in
Duke
Durham
relations
.
It
would
be
unthinkable
for
Dr
.
Price
to
underestimate
the
critical
capacity
of
Duke's
employees
and
alumni
to
contrast
Duke's
willingness
to
leverage
Grant
Hill's
well
earned
respect
to
raise
billions
for
Duke
Forward
against
Duke's
unwillingness
to
make
a
crucial
sacrifice
for
Durham's
working
class
to
have
improved
access
to
jobs
,
housing
and
healthcare
for
the
next
century
.
And
although
Dr
.
Price
is
not
deeply
invested
in
the
long
legacy
of
tenuous
Duke
Durham
relations
,
may
we
all
hope
and
pray
that
he
will
not
carelessly
undermine
his
reputation
as
a
pioneer
in
public
opinion
research
by
ignoring
the
well
documented
will
of
Durham's
myriad
civic
organizations
and
the
working
class
lives
they
represent
.
May
history
be
kind
to
you
,
Dr
.
Price
.
Sign
off
on
what
the
people
of
Durham
are
asking
you
to
do
.
The
power
of
the
pen
is
in
your
hands
.
Mi
Gente
,
Duke
University’s
Latinx
student
association
,
is
proud
to
announce
the
endorsement
of
Trey
Walk
for
Young
Trustee
!
Mi
Gente’s
council
had
the
pleasure
of
listening
to
all
four
Young
Trustee
candidates
and
after
some
deliberation
,
we
are
confident
in
Trey
being
a
good
candidate
for
Young
Trustee
and
properly
represent
Duke’s
student
body
on
the
Board
of
Trustees
.
We
were
very
impressed
by
Trey’s
platform
,
which
is
emblematic
of
the
issues
that
need
to
be
addressed
in
our
Duke
community
.
Through
his
various
involvements
,
Trey
has
demonstrated
a
strong
commitment
to
both
understanding
and
working
with
undergraduates
across
various
spaces
to
influence
change
within
the
Duke
Community
.
He
has
continuously
showed
his
determination
and
dedication
,
recently
through
his
activism
with
People’s
State
of
the
University
.
With
his
help
,
PSOTU
has
brought
demands
to
be
met
to
Duke’s
administration
.
Specifically
,
Trey
has
been
instrumental
in
establishing
the
conversation
with
administration
about
issues
such
as
the
potential
cuts
to
financial
aid
and
health
care
for
students
,
implementing
banning
the
box
through
elevating
student
voices
.
As
one
of
the
members
of
the
President’s
working
group
,
Trey
has
gained
the
skills
necessary
to
discuss
important
issues
with
administration
.
Trey
is
also
involved
in
Black
Men’s
Union
,
the
search
committee
for
the
new
Vice
President
of
Student
Affairs
,
and
is
a
mentor
for
first
generation
college
students
,
all
of
which
have
contributed
to
his
ability
to
excel
in
representing
our
community
as
Young
Trustee
.
Ultimately
,
Mi
Gente
believes
that
Trey’s
commitment
to
Duke’s
student
body
and
inclusivity
as
well
as
his
commitment
for
accountability
and
equity
on
campus
will
translate
well
to
a
role
on
the
Board
of
Trustees
.
We
fully
support
his
candidacy
and
we
encourage
you
to
vote
for
Trey
Walk
.
Signed
Duke
International
Association
IA
is
pleased
to
formally
endorse
Trey
Walk
as
Young
Trustee
.
After
hearing
from
all
four
outstanding
candidates
on
February
4
,
IA
believes
that
Trey’s
diverse
experience
in
the
Duke
and
Durham
community
,
his
efforts
to
connect
with
people
from
different
backgrounds
and
cultures
,
and
his
recognition
of
challenges
that
lie
ahead
of
Duke
enable
him
to
best
serve
the
role
of
a
Young
Trustee
.
Trey
has
been
dedicated
to
listening
and
learning
from
other
students
,
seeing
Duke
at
its
best
and
seeing
where
Duke
gets
it
wrong
.
He
is
a
leader
in
People’s
State
of
the
University
and
has
collaborated
with
other
student
activists
on
pressing
social
justice
issues
including
healthcare
coverage
,
and
hate
and
bias
policy
.
His
capability
of
representing
all
voices
of
Duke
and
challenging
the
university
to
act
on
its
highest
instincts
is
further
highlighted
by
his
involvement
in
Black
Men’s
Union
,
President
Price’s
Working
Group
on
Community
and
Dialogue
,
and
the
1G
Pre
Orientation
Program
for
first
gen
,
low
income
students
.
Studying
history
and
human
rights
,
Trey
has
also
been
engaged
in
the
service
of
Durham
community
at
large
.
He
was
on
the
Board
of
Directors
at
the
Community
Empowerment
Fund
,
and
he
worked
with
the
Marian
Cheek
Jackson
Center
to
preserve
historically
African
American
neighborhoods
in
Chapel
Hill
.
Trey’s
experience
demonstrates
that
he
is
willing
to
better
Duke
for
not
only
its
students
,
staff
,
and
faculty
,
but
also
the
neighbors
essential
to
its
success
.
IA
appreciates
all
candidates
for
sharing
with
us
their
understanding
of
the
challenges
facing
international
students
at
Duke
.
IA
is
impressed
with
the
skillsets
,
visions
and
values
that
all
candidates
bring
forward
,
including
Archana
Ahlawat’s
passion
in
empowering
women
through
diversity
and
inclusion
initiatives
,
Luke
Farrell’s
experience
in
administrative
communication
and
advocacy
projects
,
and
Brian
Buhr’s
grasp
of
Duke’s
power
and
responsibility
on
a
national
and
global
scale
.
A
few
years
ago
,
a
group
of
students
at
my
high
school
started
a
blog
inspired
by
Humans
of
New
York
,
where
they
compiled
photos
and
stories
of
students
and
teachers
.
I
was
happy
about
this
because
I
love
reading
Humans
of
New
York
stories
,
stories
ranging
from
trying
to
fulfill
the
American
dream
to
having
a
mother
that’s
an
activist
to
writing
a
play
about
an
ex
girlfriend
.
However
,
when
I
looked
at
the
blog
for
my
high
school
,
there
weren’t
the
compelling
stories
and
insights
that
I
expected
.
There
were
just
pictures
of
people
I
knew
with
vague
generalizations
such
as
,
I
love
sports
at
this
high
school
and
how
competitive
it
is
and
I’ve
had
some
really
influential
teachers
.
I
don’t
think
that
the
people
at
my
high
school
were
inherently
less
interesting
than
the
people
profiled
in
Humans
of
New
York
.
The
difference
between
these
two
blogs
was
a
difference
of
who
asked
the
better
questions
.
I
know
this
because
I’ve
spent
most
of
my
life
trying
to
ask
the
right
questions
.
When
I
was
younger
,
I
would
make
my
friends
play
the
Random
Question
game
where
I’d
sit
them
in
a
circle
and
ask
them
any
question
I
could
think
of
.
In
high
school
,
I
interviewed
people
for
my
local
newspaper
and
I
now
interview
people
for
Hear
at
Duke
.
For
me
,
the
most
interesting
and
complex
challenge
is
getting
to
know
one
person
well
.
But
in
any
other
challenge
we
face
,
asking
good
questions
plays
an
important
role
.
Here
are
three
things
I’ve
learned
about
how
to
ask
better
questions
.
Questions
are
underrated
.
It’s
rare
for
someone
to
quote
or
remember
a
question
.
But
it
is
only
through
questions
that
we
get
the
statements
that
people
will
quote
and
remember
.
To
me
,
the
process
of
growing
and
learning
a
person
is
simply
the
art
of
crafting
better
questions
,
and
I
hope
that
this
helps
you
do
so
.

As
you
no
doubt
realize
,
yesterday
at
Duke
was
a
day
mostly
dedicated
to
preparing
for
and
then
watching
the
Duke
v
.
s
.
UNC
men’s
basketball
game
.
I
have
the
dubious
distinction
of
being
one
of
the
very
few
undergraduates
at
Duke
who
has
never
attended
an
athletic
event
,
nor
watched
a
full
game
on
television
.
Basketball
is
unavoidable
here
,
but
I
certainly
do
try
.
My
seventh
grade
gym
teacher
once
asked
me
if
my
dad
at
least
watches
sports
on
TV
,
to
which
I
responded
no
,
we
don’t
have
cable
.
My
lack
of
interest
in
sports
has
been
a
running
theme
in
my
life
since
I
was
a
kid
.
I
grew
up
in
a
small
town
just
south
of
Chapel
Hill
,
so
this
rivalry
has
always
been
in
my
peripheral
vision
.
Now
I
live
off
campus
,
don’t
own
a
TV
,
and
my
interest
in
basketball
has
further
waned
.
I
know
.
I’m
sorry
.
I
understand
this
is
important
to
you
.
I
explain
that
no
,
you
have
to
camp
out
for
a
month
at
Duke
to
get
tickets
to
the
game
and
Ms
.
Frances
pays
good
money
for
her
rent
.
We
talk
about
how
some
of
the
tickets
cost
over
3
,
000
.
I
offer
that
I
think
it’s
wrong
for
student
athletes
not
to
get
paid
when
the
university
makes
so
much
money
off
their
labor
.
It’s
college
basketball
,
Ms
.
Frances
,
one
sixth
grader
informs
me
.
It’s
not
that
serious
.
A
few
days
ago
another
friend
from
growing
up
,
a
huge
UNC
fan
and
current
UNC
student
,
texted
me
to
ask
how
I’m
going
to
sneak
him
into
Cameron
.
I
remind
him
that
I
haven’t
actually
been
to
a
game
myself
,
to
which
he
responds
,
Frances
what
!
?
!
You’re
killing
me
.
But
I
understand
.
We
were
not
raised
to
camp
out
.
We
were
not

Just
a
few
weeks
ago
,
world
leaders
,
activists
and
wealthy
entrepreneurs
gathered
in
Davos
,
Switzerland
for
the
annual
meeting
of
the
World
Economic
Forum
.
Against
the
backdrop
of
an
extravagant
ski
resort
nestled
in
the
mountains
of
arguably
the
wealthiest
country
on
earth
,
the
forum
opened
with
the
goal
of
foster
ing
systems
of
leadership
and
global
stewardship
.
.
.
to
build
the
future
in
a
constructive
,
collaborative
way
.
The
enduring
headline
from
the
three
day
event
has
come
not
from
any
of
the
powerful
or
glamourous
attendees
,
but
from
a
speech
by
the
Dutch
historian
Rutger
Bregman
which
challenged
the
wealthy
to
examine
their
own
complicity
in
growing
economic
inequality
.
Bregman
began
by
observing
that
,
though
climate
change
was
a
central
theme
of
the
forum
,
the
majority
of
attendees
flew
to
Switzerland
on
private
jets
.
He
went
further
,
arguing
that
the
key
to
alleviating
inequality
is
to
address
tax
avoidance
by
the
wealthy
a
suggestion
that
has
garnered
Bregman
viral
fame
and
has
reignited
debates
about
the
limits
of
neoliberal
capitalism
.
At
the
same
time
,
this
week
,
the
opinion
page
of
the
Chronicle
has
played
host
to
a
forum
on
inequality
of
its
own
,
beginning
with
a
column
by
Duke
sophomore
Ali
Thursland
,
provocatively
titled
,
The
social
toll
of
being
financially
underprivileged
at
Duke
.
In
identifying
herself
as
being
financially
underprivileged
,
’
the
author
sought
to
call
attention
to
the
particular
economic
burden
of
participating
in
the
social
scene
at
an
elite
private
university
.
The
author
cited
living
group
dues
,
cover
charges
,
alcohol
and
other
expenses
as
examples
of
the
costs
associated
with
Duke’s
cost
prohibitive
social
culture
.
Moreover
,
Thursland
asked
that
wealthier
students
try
to
broaden
their
own
awareness
of
these
costs
when
interacting
with
students
who
identify
as
low
income
.
While
not
a
seemingly
radical
assertion
on
its
face
,
the
column
has
since
sparked
a
variety
of
responses
in
the
form
of
letters
and
yet
other
columns
.
One
author
took
issue
with
the
initial
column’s
Let
them
eat
cake
focus
on
the
affordability
of
Duke’s
social
culture
,
arguing
that
low
income
students
face
more
significant
challenges
than
simply
affording
Hawaiian
themed
darty
get
ups
and
Juul
pods
.
Other
voices
called
for
validation
and
support
within
the
low
income
student
community
rather
than
arguments
over
petty
differences
,
while
another
repeated
the
oft
cited
neoliberal
refrain
that
low
income
students
are
simply
failing
to
work
hard
enough
and
budget
appropriately
.
These
pieces
for
the
most
part
all
cite
the
same
statistics
.
The
median
household
income
at
Duke
tops
out
at
almost
200
,
000
.
20
percent
of
students
here
come
from
families
that
make
630
,
000
or
more
.
What
is
most
important
to
note
about
wealth
stratification
at
Duke
is
how
differently
each
of
these
authors
interpret
these
statistics
.
For
students
whose
wealth
is
not
reflective
of
the
moneyed
majority
on
this
campus
who
belong
to
the
proverbial
one
percent
,
there
is
certainly
a
sense
of
relative
deprivation
.
In
validating
those
experiences
though
,
we
cannot
forget
their
relativity
.
A
student
considered
low
income
at
Duke
someone
whose
family
income
is
around
80
,
000
a
year
and
would
be
eligible
for
almost
full
financial
aid
coverage
would
be
categorized
as
existing
solidly
within
the
American
middle
class
outside
the
Gothic
Wonderland
.
Much
like
how
,
as
Bregman
pointed
out
,
the
lavish
chalets
and
glistening
conference
centers
that
populate
Davos
obscure
the
realities
of
inequality
,
our
campus
environment
has
entirely
skewed
our
understanding
of
wealth
.
Not
having
a
car
on
campus
,
having
to
maintain
a
work
study
job
and
not
being
able
to
afford
a
Canada
Goose
puffer
are
seen
as
symbols
of
being
low
income
at
Duke
.
Solidly
upper
class
students
love
to
gripe
about
how
poor
they
are
,
having
spent
their
entire
allowance
on
shots
at
Shooters
or
steaks
at
the
Washington
Duke
.
Meanwhile
,
outside
of
Duke
,
without
the
economic
and
social
protections
of
an
elite
university
environment
,
many
Durham
residents
have
to
deal
with
issues
more
genuinely
tied
to
poverty
homelessness
,
skyrocketing
rent
,
minimum
wage
jobs
,
etc
.
We
have
not
made
space
on
campus
to
have
conversations
about
inequality
beyond
being
reminded
every
so
often
that
it
exists
in
the
form
of
persistent
social
problems
that
we
all
should
try
to
solve
in
the
manner
of
Knowledge
in
the
Service
of
Society
.
Instead
,
from
the
millions
of
dollars
that
gild
campus
facilities
to
the
ever
increasing
price
of
tuition
,
the
standard
of
wealth
experienced
by
the
majority
of
students
on
this
campus
is
accepted
and
celebrated
.
If
these
stories
from
Davos
and
Duke
have
taught
us
anything
,
it
is
that
we
are
greatly
in
need
of
an
acknowledgement
of
the
relationship
between
wealth
and
inequality
as
well
as
,
perhaps
,
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
relativity
of
our
on
campus
realities
.
As
second
semester
rolls
in
full
force
,
networking
events
and
cover
letter
writing
workshops
abound
.
Swarms
of
students
contend
for
a
wide
variety
of
summer
internships
,
caught
in
a
mad
dash
for
work
experiences
to
pad
their
CVs
and
resumes
.
My
own
email
inbox
is
drowning
with
reminders
of
application
deadlines
and
tips
from
the
Career
Center
.
In
spite
of
it
all
,
I
find
myself
oddly
distant
from
this
frenzy
of
polished
cover
letters
and
sweat
stained
suits
.
Amid
this
networking
blur
,
I’ve
instead
come
to
realize
just
how
suffocating
pre
professionalism
is
at
Duke
.
In
my
first
article
,
I
reflected
upon
the
modern
Renaissance
student
in
an
attempt
to
address
my
academic
indecision
.
While
I
touched
upon
the
issue
of
pre
professionalism
,
I
fell
short
of
genuinely
criticizing
this
aspect
of
campus
culture
.
But
as
Duke
explodes
with
internship
opportunities
and
job
recruitment
,
I
can’t
ignore
the
pervasive
problems
connected
to
this
obsession
.
A
culture
of
pre
professionalism
undoubtedly
rages
across
campus
,
spreading
its
tendrils
to
flocks
of
impressionable
,
emerging
adults
.
And
I
get
it
we
need
to
be
thoughtful
and
logical
about
our
futures
.
Higher
education
is
largely
predicated
upon
the
idea
of
workforce
readiness
.
We
declare
a
major
,
stumble
through
four
expensive
years
of
education
,
equip
ourselves
with
the
ethos
and
experience
to
present
to
future
employers
and
get
a
job
all
to
survive
the
brutal
monotony
of
the
real
world
.
Because
of
this
procedural
,
linear
progression
,
college
students
have
likewise
adopted
more
practical
realities
.
Long
gone
are
the
childhood
whimsies
filled
with
fun
and
imaginative
professions
of
astronauts
,
wizards
,
detectives
and
entertainers
.
And
at
Duke
,
it
seems
as
though
vocational
diversity
has
lost
its
appeal
.
Besieged
by
mobs
of
pre
med
students
and
future
consultants
,
the
idea
of
life
itself
beyond
Duke
has
taken
such
a
narrow
definition
,
encapsulated
in
a
single
question
The
epidemic
of
pre
professionalism
at
Duke
spills
into
the
classroom
,
influencing
students’
academic
tracks
.
But
perhaps
more
concerning
than
course
selection
are
the
incessant
complaints
against
mandatory
liberal
arts
requirements
.
I
see
people
blistering
with
frustration
that
they
have
to
sit
through
upwards
of
three
entire
semesters
of
a
foreign
language
.
I
watch
as
people
roll
their
eyes
at
the
sheer
preposterousness
of
being
Pratt
or
being
pre
med
and
having
to
take
those
humanities
classes
.
I
listen
as
people
moan
and
groan
about
how
stupid
and
pointless
the
Areas
of
Knowledge
and
Modes
of
Inquiry
are
.
These
grumblings
aren’t
imagined
I
hear
it
in
the
common
room
;
I
hear
it
in
West
Union
and
Marketplace
;
I
hear
it
on
the
C1
.
I
understand
that
the
current
system
has
its
flaws
.
And
I
recognize
that
everyone
has
their
own
passions
and
interests
.
But
I
find
it
hard
to
be
sympathetic
to
people
so
close
minded
that
they
can’t
even
scrounge
up
basic
appreciation
of
other
fields
of
inquiry
.
However
,
my
purpose
is
not
to
criticize
students
for
their
academic
interests
or
future
career
plans
.
My
purpose
is
to
provoke
thoughtful
conversations
on
the
collective
wisdom
Duke
has
to
offer
.
There
is
every
opportunity
here
to
personalize
the
learning
experience
and
push
the
boundaries
of
knowledge
.
Duke
is
unique
in
that
it
doubles
as
both
a
liberal
arts
institution
and
a
cutting
edge
research
university
.
Covering
a
wide
umbrella
of
interests
and
interdisciplinary
focuses
,
I’m
proud
to
call
Duke
my
intellectual
home
.
And
yet
,
somehow
,
I
feel
like
I’m
sequestered
in
the
future
occupational
minority
here
.
I’m
neither
pre
med
nor
plan
on
going
into
consulting
.
I
had
thought
I
escaped
the
smothering
grip
of
pre
professionalism
when
I
came
to
Duke
,
only
to
find
myself
gasping
for
breath
as
I
attempt
to
stay
afloat
on
a
campus
swimming
with
job
recruiters
and
professional
internship
opportunities
.
Suffice
it
to
say
,
Duke
is
going
through
an
identity
crisis
.
While
giving
every
appearance
of
being
a
liberal
arts
school
,
the
preponderance
of
the
student
body
shows
a
clear
inclination
toward
pre
professionalism
.
This
incongruity
between
the
university’s
academic
mission
and
the
realities
of
the
student
culture
cannot
persist
without
collapse
.
For
a
campus
to
exist
in
such
ideological
extremes
is
already
precarious
,
and
as
disheartening
as
it
is
to
admit
,
it
seems
as
though
some
students
are
irrevocably
fixated
on
the
diploma
and
not
discovery
.
What
ensues
is
an
academic
assembly
line
that
churns
out
identical
Duke
grads
.
But
to
simply
float
through
four
empty
years
at
Duke
,
not
pursuing
what
you
are
passionate
about
,
I
think
is
outright
sacrilegious
.
I
believe
that
students
should
come
to
Duke
eager
to
ignite
their
academic
and
personal
explorations
and
actually
be
able
to
implement
them
.
This
doesn’t
mean
throwing
yourself
in
the
vocational
status
quo
,
but
taking
a
step
back
and
considering
the
value
of
a
Duke
education
as
a
whole
.
You
chose
Duke
.
Maybe
because
of
the
name
,
the
prestige
or
even
the
gothic
architecture
.
And
perhaps
you
chose
Duke
because
of
its
outstanding
alumni
network
.
But
whatever
the
reason
is
,
I
hope
you
realize
that
your
education
means
more
than
a
degree
or
a
professional
network
.
Duke
is
often
referred
to
as
a
bubble
,
where
students
live
comfortably
in
a
world
far
removed
from
the
stark
reality
of
the
greater
Durham
community
.
But
we
are
also
removed
politically
.
Like
many
top
tier
institutions
,
Duke
attracts
a
liberal
demographic
that
isn’t
representative
of
the
national
landscape
.
In
other
words
,
we
are
in
a
liberal
bubble
.
Even
though
I
am
nearing
the
end
of
my
third
year
at
Duke
,
only
a
handful
of
times
have
I
been
forced
to
acknowledge
my
political
bias
.
One
of
those
times
was
earlier
this
semester
,
when
I
overheard
two
graduate
students
in
Sanford
discussing
Trump’s
foreign
policy
.
One
was
vehemently
exalting
the
president’s
foreign
policy
strategy
,
outlining
the
benefits
in
great
detail
.
I
felt
myself
growing
frustrated
as
my
liberal
bias
kicked
in
.
How
could
he
commend
Trump’s
decision
to
pull
out
of
Afghanistan
or
his
peace
deal
with
North
Korea
?
But
as
I
tried
to
think
of
counterarguments
to
his
points
,
I
blanked
.
I
was
unable
to
articulate
why
I
was
against
Trump’s
policies
.
Why
couldn’t
I
soundly
defend
my
own
beliefs
or
take
down
the
ones
I
so
passionately
opposed
?
The
reason
is
that
I
rarely
find
myself
in
a
position
where
I
have
to
back
up
my
political
opinions
.
I’ve
always
been
surrounded
by
like
minded
people
.
I
grew
up
in
a
liberal
household
,
where
my
dad
would
spend
his
evenings
watching
Bill
Maher
,
Stephen
Colbert
and
Rachel
Maddow
.
Those
are
the
voices
I
grew
up
with
,
and
when
I
came
to
Duke
,
those
voices
were
amplified
.
In
the
past
year
,
I
have
attended
talks
by
progressive
speakers
like
DNC
Chairman
Tom
Perez
,
Senator
Bernie
Sanders
and
NBC
Political
Director
Chuck
Todd
.
My
peers
are
left
leaning
as
well
most
of
my
friends
cried
with
me
when
Donald
Trump
was
elected
president
,
and
they
were
also
by
my
side
to
lament
the
nomination
of
Brett
Kavanaugh
to
the
Supreme
Court
.
For
many
,
especially
those
who
feel
marginalized
by
certain
right
wing
policies
,
these
emotions
are
valid
and
be
vocalized
.
For
others
like
myself
,
it
can
be
difficult
to
pinpoint
why
we
feel
an
instinctive
and
almost
emotional
attachment
to
our
political
beliefs
.
Jonathan
Haidt
presents
a
compelling
theory
in
The
Righteous
Mind
Why
Good
People
Are
Divided
by
Politics
and
Religion
the
idea
of
the
elephant
and
the
rider
.
Our
emotional
side
is
the
elephant
and
our
rational
side
is
the
rider
.
Sitting
atop
the
elephant
with
reins
in
hand
,
the
rider
appears
to
call
the
shots
.
But
the
six
ton
elephant
is
ultimately
the
decision
maker
.
When
the
two
disagree
,
the
rider
cannot
overpower
the
elephant
.
This
is
all
to
say
that
we
choose
sides
based
on
our
emotions
and
then
use
our
head
to
rationalize
our
choices
.
The
purpose
of
higher
education
is
to
challenge
the
elephant
.
I
came
to
university
to
engage
in
debate
,
to
ask
hard
questions
and
to
uncover
deeper
truths
.
While
I
have
been
challenged
in
subjects
like
ethics
and
history
,
I
feel
that
I
lack
exposure
to
the
other
side
of
the
political
aisle
.
Perhaps
it’s
because
professors
at
most
elite
liberal
arts
schools
are
relatively
homogeneous
in
political
affiliation
,
and
academic
institutions
that
create
liberal
bubbles
foster
a
culture
that
implicitly
excludes
conservative
voices
from
discussion
.
This
has
serious
repercussions
.
John
Stuart
Mill
warned
that
the
peculiar
evil
of
silencing
the
expression
of
an
opinion
is
,
that
it
is
robbing
the
human
race
;
posterity
as
well
as
the
existing
generation
;
those
who
dissent
from
the
opinion
,
still
more
than
those
who
hold
it
.
If
the
opinion
is
right
,
they
are
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
exchanging
error
for
truth
if
wrong
,
they
lose
,
what
is
almost
as
great
a
benefit
,
the
clearer
perception
and
livelier
impression
of
truth
,
produced
by
its
collision
with
error
.
Students
should
seek
out
the
opinions
of
intelligent
people
with
whom
they
disagree
,
for
intellectual
growth
comes
from
challenging
your
own
ideas
to
bolster
your
argument
.
A
Ted
Talk
by
Williams
College
graduate
Zachary
Wood
called
Why
we
should
listen
to
views
we
find
offensive
?
expands
on
the
idea
that
we
get
stronger
,
not
weaker
,
by
engaging
with
the
other
side
.
That’s
why
Wood
,
an
African
American
student
,
invited
John
Derbyshire
and
Charles
Murray
two
authors
who
have
written
about
and
supported
white
supremacist
theories
to
speak
at
his
school
,
knowing
that
he
would
be
giving
them
a
platform
for
ideas
that
he
abhorred
.
The
objective
is
to
gain
understanding
by
engaging
with
the
very
ideas
that
make
us
uncomfortable
.
To
uphold
the
commitment
to
education
and
inclusion
at
Duke
,
and
for
the
political
health
of
our
nation
,
it
is
crucial
that
everyone’s
views
are
challenged
liberals
,
conservatives
,
and
everyone
in
between
.
As
Duke
students
,
we
should
attempt
to
escape
our
echo
chamber
by
seeking
out
environments
that
encourage
us
to
defend
our
viewpoints
.
One
attempt
I’ve
made
recently
was
downloading
an
app
called
Read
Across
the
Aisle
,
which
tracks
your
media
political
bias
.
Whenever
you
read
the
news
,
the
app
shows
the
political
orientation
of
each
source
and
reminds
you
to
check
out
news
from
another
angle
if
it
detects
that
you've
been
reading
from
one
side
of
the
aisle
for
too
long
.
It
turns
out
that
there
are
other
great
news
outlets
besides
NPR
and
the
New
York
Times
.
Ignoring
opinions
you
don’t
agree
with
doesn't
make
them
disappear
.
To
progress
in
the
face
of
adversity
and
to
reach
consensus
in
an
increasingly
polarized
nation
,
we
must
commit
to
acquiring
a
deeper
understanding
of
humanity
.
Ralph
Northam
,
the
current
Democratic
governor
of
Virginia
,
is
currently
facing
demands
for
his
resignation
in
response
to
a
racist
photograph
from
his
medical
school
years
that
was
included
on
his
yearbook
page
.
In
his
page
from
the
Eastern
Virginia
Medical
School’s
1984
yearbook
,
reporters
have
identified
a
photograph
that
depicts
a
young
man
in
blackface
and
another
dressed
in
Ku
Klux
Klan
robes
.
Northam
immediately
issued
an
apology
,
admitting
that
he
was
one
of
the
individuals
in
the
yearbook
before
recanting
his
statement
.
Despite
his
statement
on
Friday
,
Northam
now
denies
that
either
of
the
individuals
in
the
yearbook
is
him
,
but
does
admit
that
he
apparently
did
once
darken
his
face
for
a
Michael
Jackson
impersonation
contest
in
1984
.
The
incident
has
resulted
in
nationwide
calls
for
his
resignation
from
the
likes
of
fellow
Democrats
such
as
Joe
Biden
and
Alexandria
Ocasio
Cortez
,
which
Northam
has
responded
to
swiftly
by
saying
that
he
would
continue
to
serve
the
state
of
Virginia
despite
his
past
actions
.
As
a
moderate
Democrat
in
a
state
that
is
characterized
by
a
deep
partisan
divisions
,
Governor
Northam
has
generally
supported
liberal
causes
,
from
backing
reproductive
rights
to
advocating
for
more
stringent
gun
control
policies
.
Regardless
of
party
lines
and
his
voting
record
,
Northam’s
actions
are
yet
another
instance
in
the
long
legacy
of
racism
in
the
United
States
.
Coincidentally
,
Duke
alum
Justin
Fairfax
would
become
Northam’s
successor
if
he
ultimately
does
step
down
from
the
governorship
.
Fairfax
made
headlines
last
month
when
he
was
the
lone
state
official
to
sit
out
during
Virginia’s
annual
tribute
to
Robert
E
.
Lee
.
nbsp
;
He
later
commented
that
it
was
disrespectful
to
partake
in
the
ceremony
given
Lee’s
connection
to
the
Confederacy
and
the
legacy
of
institutional
racism
in
the
United
States
post
slavery
.
Unfortunately
,
scandals
of
this
nature
will
undoubtedly
happen
again
whether
it
be
a
public
official
or
a
celebrity
of
some
sort
.
If
we
look
back
at
any
yearbook
,
we
are
bound
to
find
fault
with
a
photo
done
in
poor
taste
or
something
outright
abhorrent
.
A
page
from
the
1956
Chanticleer
,
for
instance
,
contains
a
photograph
of
merry
white
Duke
students
dressed
in
yellow
face
at
an
Oriental
themed
frat
party
nearly
fifty
years
before
2013’s
Asia
Prime
incident
.
As
a
society
we
are
left
to
grapple
with
the
aftermath
of
numerous
scandals
involving
race
and
personal
ethics
which
call
into
question
the
merits
of
call
out
culture
.
We
must
ask
ourselves
how
much
time
is
necessary
before
one
ought
to
step
back
from
the
spotlight
,
and
what
exactly
must
be
done
by
the
transgressor
to
ensure
that
the
harm
caused
is
repaired
.
Northam
was
an
adult
man
in
medical
school
when
he
decided
to
dress
up
and
appear
in
the
photo
,
which
he
originally
said
he
was
in
.
Although
a
commonly
accepted
comedic
practice
from
the
1850s
to
the
1950s
,
blackface
has
since
come
to
widely
be
seen
as
a
cultural
practice
that
is
outright
racist
.
If
Northam's
misdeeds
were
revealed
while
he
was
practicing
medicine
,
it
might
be
tempting
to
say
that
he
should
simply
be
ousted
from
his
position
,
but
that
may
not
be
the
best
course
of
action
when
trying
to
address
a
history
that
is
as
storied
and
controversial
as
the
United
States
.
It
is
reassuring
that
the
American
people
from
all
walks
of
life
have
issued
calls
for
Northam’s
resignation
.
One
need
only
go
back
several
decades
to
find
individuals
who
committed
egregious
crimes
and
were
let
off
the
hook
,
either
by
a
lack
of
accountability
of
our
political
institutions
or
due
to
the
human
tendency
to
immortalize
the
dead
and
focus
on
the
positive
aspects
of
a
public
figure's
life
.
President
John
F
.
Kennedy
sexually
harassed
numerous
women
while
Senator
Ted
Kennedy
was
driving
the
car
in
an
accident
that
resulted
in
his
secretary
dead
in
a
lake
both
Kennedy
brothers
received
relative
wrist
slaps
for
their
offenses
.
Prominent
white
men
getting
away
with
killing
,
sexual
assault
and
racism
are
not
anomalies
in
our
current
political
system
;
they
make
up
the
legacy
that
the
United
States
has
struggled
to
address
for
centuries
.
If
Ralph
Northam
is
in
the
business
of
making
amends
in
response
to
past
racism
,
he
should
step
down
and
let
Fairfax
occupy
the
Executive
Mansion
in
Richmond
.
First
and
foremost
,
elected
officials
are
supposed
to
represent
their
constituents
in
good
faith
to
the
best
of
their
ability
.
If
at
any
point
,
they
lose
the
confidence
of
the
people
they
serve
,
they
have
a
responsibility
to
do
what
is
right
to
abdicate
authority
.
I’ll
start
with
a
thought
experiment
.
The
recent
Chronicle
editorial
board
piece
that
addressed
the
Ilhan
Omar
controversy
included
the
following
line
The
tweet
drew
some
deserved
criticism
for
her
admittedly
ill
conceived
wording
,
and
Omar
subsequently
offered
an
apology
.
Let’s
substitute
Omar
and
her
situation
with
Ralph
Northam
and
his
blackface
controversy
.
The
sentence
becomes
,
The
photograph
drew
some
deserved
criticism
for
his
admittedly
ill
conceived
costume
,
and
Northam
subsequently
offered
an
apology
.
If
this
was
a
line
in
a
Chronicle
Editorial
Board
article
,
I
imagine
we’d
justifiably
be
up
in
arms
at
the
trivialization
of
his
actions
.
Jewish
students
have
a
right
to
feel
upset
about
the
Editorial
Board’s
wording
.
After
all
,
bigotry
should
be
evaluated
by
the
way
it
makes
people
feel
,
not
the
intention
of
the
perpetrator
.
I
don’t
speak
for
Jews
at
Duke
,
and
I
certainly
don’t
speak
for
Judaism
as
a
whole
.
Judaism
is
a
notoriously
diverse
religion
,
with
populations
hailing
from
Israel
,
India
,
China
,
Ethiopia
,
Iran
and
Argentina
,
among
others
.
With
a
diversity
of
roots
comes
a
diversity
of
opinions
.
Naturally
,
there
is
a
broad
spectrum
of
Jewish
perspectives
on
religious
issues
,
politics
and
,
of
course
,
Israel
.
Far
too
often
critics
of
Israel
and
or
anti
Semites
weaponize
the
diversity
of
opinion
in
Jewish
circles
to
cherry
pick
Jewish
voices
to
their
advantage
.
The
editorial
board
comes
dangerously
close
to
doing
so
by
giving
a
nod
to
the
radical
activism
of
groups
like
Jewish
Voice
for
Peace
,
a
group
that
exists
on
the
margins
of
mainstream
Jewish
thought
and
has
been
repeatedly
criticized
by
the
Anti
Defamation
League
,
the
premier
anti
Semitism
watchdog
,
for
perpetuating
anti
Jewish
stereotypes
.
Another
example
of
this
phenomenon
is
a
recent
tweet
from
Linda
Sarsour
,
a
founder
of
the
Women’s
March
,
who
directs
her
followers
not
to
support
the
oldest
Jewish
newspaper
in
America
.
Journalist
Yair
Rosenberg
rightly
points
out
that
the
tweet
delineates
good
Jews
from
bad
Jews
.
Tokenizing
the
marginal
views
of
minority
groups
,
whether
they
are
on
the
left
or
the
right
,
should
be
condemned
.
Look
no
further
than
last
year’s
Duke
College
Republicans’
American
Muslim
Identity
Patriot
or
Insurgent
event
,
which
was
rightly
criticized
for
unfairly
representing
mainstream
American
Islam
and
propagating
fringe
views
.
Duke
students
and
Americans
as
a
whole
need
to
start
thinking
about
anti
Semitism
in
a
different
way
.
I’ve
found
that
people
,
especially
on
Duke’s
campus
,
are
quicker
to
criticize
claims
of
anti
Semitism
than
they
are
to
try
to
empathize
with
them
.
Rather
than
immediately
charging
offended
Jews
with
intellectual
dishonesty
or
intentional
conflation
of
anti
Semitism
and
anti
Zionism
,
try
to
understand
why
they
feel
offended
.
As
a
society
,
we
shouldn’t
tell
minorities
how
they
are
allowed
to
feel
,
especially
when
they
are
victims
of
bigotry
.
We
should
condemn
those
who
dismiss
the
feelings
of
minorities
offhand
.
I’d
be
remiss
if
I
didn’t
mention
that
this
phenomenon
is
often
felt
by
Palestinians
.
Critics
are
quick
to
attack
the
Palestinian
narrative
and
trivialize
their
grievances
.
Ultimately
,
though
,
the
same
expectation
applies
to
Jews
.
Sympathy
is
the
product
of
a
rigorous
interrogation
of
our
innate
biases
,
and
we
should
always
strive
to
achieve
the
most
complete
understanding
of
our
peers’
experiences
.
Israel
is
the
ultimate
elephant
in
the
room
of
anti
Semitism
.
Many
,
including
the
Editorial
Board
,
take
issue
with
what
they
perceive
as
an
intentional
charge
of
anti
Semitism
to
deflect
from
real
issues
.
This
charge
is
unfair
.
Anti
Semitism
should
be
evaluated
on
the
basis
of
how
it
makes
Jews
feel
.
It
is
not
unreasonable
to
feel
offended
when
a
Congresswoman
claims
politicians
support
Israel
because
they
are
paid
off
even
though
,
as
Max
Cherman
and
Ezra
Loeb
noted
,
75
percent
of
Americans
support
Israel
.
When
six
million
Jews
were
killed
due
to
perceptions
that
they
were
too
powerful
or
had
unacceptable
political
views
,
Jews
are
right
to
feel
threatened
by
objectionable
rhetoric
.
Israel
dialogue
is
tricky
,
and
I
concede
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
find
the
threshold
where
criticism
turns
anti
Semitic
,
but
it’s
important
to
remember
that
there
a
threshold
.
A
few
tips
for
talking
critically
about
Israel
are
to
avoid
sweeping
generalizations
about
Israelis
,
apply
the
same
standard
to
Israel
that
one
would
to
any
other
country
,
and
be
specific
about
the
policies
with
which
one
disagrees
.
Failing
to
abide
by
these
three
principles
often
results
in
anti
Semitic
rhetoric
.
Regarding
AIPAC
,
Batya
Ungar
Sargon
put
it
best
Of
course
,
it’s
fair
to
criticize
AIPAC
.
But
Omar
did
not
criticize
AIPAC
.
She
it
,
in
a
way
that
is
false
,
and
that
got
the
story
of
AIPAC’s
influence
wrong
in
a
way
that
played
right
into
anti
Semitic
tropes
.
In
talking
about
the
Israel
lobby
,
it’s
imperative
that
a
critic
be
accurate
to
its
actual
source
of
power
.
As
noted
earlier
,
a
tremendously
high
percentage
of
America
supports
Israel
.
The
reason
political
candidates
tout
their
pro
Israel
credentials
proudly
isn’t
that
they
are
paid
to
do
so
,
but
because
Americans
overwhelmingly
believe
in
a
strong
relationship
between
America
and
Israel
.
Ungar
Sargon
then
references
Evan
Gottesman
who
points
out
how
Arab
countries
spent
more
money
lobbying
than
the
pro
Israel
lobby
,
but
no
politician
brags
about
their
support
for
the
Gulf
states
.
It
is
fine
if
one
wishes
to
criticize
AIPAC
for
its
mission
,
but
they
should
be
aware
of
how
their
language
is
interpreted
by
others
.
Duke
students
should
spend
less
time
objecting
to
claims
of
anti
Semitism
and
spend
more
time
asking
their
Jewish
friends
about
their
experiences
being
asked
where
their
horns
are
,
looking
down
at
a
desk
only
to
find
a
swastika
,
or
sadly
,
being
violently
attacked
for
being
Jewish
.
In
2019
,
when
almost
40
percent
of
European
Jews
have
considered
emigrating
in
the
last
five
years
due
to
anti
Semitism
,
Jews
are
consistently
evicted
from
progressive
movements
and
popular
leaders
on
the
left
and
right
are
openly
espousing
anti
Semitism
,
trust
your
Jewish
friends
when
they
tell
you
they
are
uncomfortable
.
Only
by
creating
a
common
language
in
responding
to
bigotry
can
we
hope
to
stop
it
.
We
are
writing
in
response
to
an
inflammatory
,
fallacious
,
and
anti
Semitic
opinion
piece
published
by
the
Duke
Chronicle
Editorial
Board
.
As
part
of
the
Jewish
community
,
we
belong
to
a
group
that
spans
all
corners
of
the
world
and
encompasses
all
skin
colors
,
nationalities
,
and
sexual
orientations
.
While
Jews
have
lived
continuously
in
the
Land
of
Israel
for
two
millennia
,
global
anti
Semitism
and
massacres
necessitated
that
the
Jewish
people
exercise
their
right
to
self
determination
and
become
an
equal
amongst
the
community
of
nations
.
Legitimate
criticism
of
the
Jewish
state’s
policies
has
,
and
always
will
be
,
acceptable
one
must
look
no
further
than
internal
Israeli
politics
to
see
this
.
However
,
the
delegitimization
,
mischaracterization
,
and
dehumanization
of
the
Jewish
state
and
its
citizens
with
reckless
disregard
for
facts
separates
the
Jewish
people
from
all
others
.
The
mischaracterization
of
any
group
to
smear
the
existence
of
their
political
entity
is
unacceptable
,
and
Jews
are
no
exception
.
The
opinion
piece
by
the
Editorial
Board
is
extremely
troubling
and
crosses
a
red
line
.
The
Editorial
Board
attempts
to
draw
a
distinction
between
anti
Semitism
and
anti
Zionism
.
As
a
board
without
a
single
Jewish
member
,
the
Editorial
Board
has
no
right
to
define
anti
Semitism
.
While
criticism
of
Israel
is
not
inherently
anti
Semitic
,
the
Editorial
Board
,
nevertheless
,
engages
in
hurtful
anti
Semitic
tropes
.
By
labeling
Israel
a
settler
colonialist
project
,
the
Editorial
Board
denies
the
right
for
a
Jewish
State
to
exist
and
crosses
the
line
into
anti
Semitism
.
The
label
of
settler
colonialism
disregards
Jewish
history
,
including
the
fact
that
Jews
have
had
a
continuous
presence
in
the
Land
of
Israel
and
the
Middle
East
for
two
thousand
years
.
Currently
,
61
percent
of
Israeli
Jews
are
Mizrahi
Jews
of
Middle
Eastern
rather
than
European
origin
.
Further
,
nineteenth
and
twentieth
century
Jewish
immigration
to
the
Land
of
Israel
occurred
under
duress
and
was
not
an
attempt
to
colonize
a
foreign
land
.
The
Editorial
Board
further
characterizes
Israel
as
engaging
in
genocidal
policies
,
a
false
and
misleading
statement
.
We
lament
the
death
of
any
civilian
.
It
is
also
true
,
however
,
that
most
fatalities
in
recent
flare
ups
were
individuals
actively
threatening
the
lives
of
Israelis
and
later
claimed
by
terrorist
organizations
as
members
.
The
Editorial
Board
fails
to
note
that
,
while
Israel
goes
to
great
lengths
to
avoid
civilian
death
,
Israel’s
enemies
actively
target
civilians
.
By
ignoring
the
intentions
of
countless
groups
in
the
region
to
wipe
Israel
off
the
face
of
the
Earth
and
by
falsely
accusing
Israel
of
genocide
,
the
Editorial
Board
warps
an
extremely
complex
political
situation
to
seem
simple
and
one
sided
.
AIPAC
is
not
a
political
action
committee
as
the
Editorial
Board
writes
,
but
rather
a
public
affairs
committee
.
The
American
Israel
Public
Affairs
Committee
is
powerful
because
74
percent
of
Americans
stand
with
Israel
.
American
citizens
are
speaking
out
on
an
issue
that
matters
to
them
.
This
is
the
ultimate
expression
of
American
democracy
.
AIPAC
does
not
fund
or
donate
to
any
politicians
,
nor
does
it
work
for
a
foreign
government
,
as
an
article
cited
by
the
Editorial
Board
claims
.
Additionally
,
recent
legislation
has
not
attempted
to
criminalize
boycotting
Israel
.
A
look
at
the
actual
law
shows
that
this
is
another
false
claim
.
The
notion
that
AIPAC’s
role
in
politics
is
outsized
and
damaging
further
engages
in
anti
Semitic
tropes
.
The
trope
of
Jewish
power
has
been
used
for
millennia
to
punch
upwards
against
Jewish
bankers
,
store
owners
,
and
racial
infiltrators
,
and
has
led
to
some
of
history’s
worst
instances
of
oppression
.
We
would
like
to
talk
with
the
author
about
the
hurt
caused
by
their
words
and
fallacious
statements
and
begin
to
build
a
better
understanding
for
each
other’s
perspectives
and
the
nature
of
21st
century
anti
Semitism
.
Wednesday
marks
50
years
since
dozens
of
Black
students
took
over
the
Allen
Building
on
Feb
.
13
,
1969
and
issued
demands
for
administrative
action
.
Duke's
racial
history
did
not
start
or
stop
with
the
Allen
Building
Takeover
.
The
events
that
led
up
to
the
Takeover
were
marked
with
activism
,
and
the
half
century
since
has
seen
students
continuing
to
push
for
progress
.
This
past
weekend
,
many
of
the
Allen
Building
Takeover
participants
returned
to
campus
to
commemorate
the
event
.
A
reunion
was
held
and
panels
discussed
the
Takeover
and
student
activism
since
then
.
As
the
University
commemorates
the
students'
actions
50
years
ago
and
examines
the
struggles
for
racial
and
labor
equality
since
then
,
we
invite
members
of
the
Duke
community
to
submit
letters
to
the
editor
this
week
about
the
Takeover
and
the
legacy
those
student
activists
left
behind
from
a
half
century
ago
.
Letters
should
be
less
than
325
words
in
length
and
can
be
submitted
by
email
to
chronicleletters
duke
.
edu
.

On
February
8
,
1968
,
three
18
year
old
students
from
South
Carolina
State
University
,
a
HBCU
in
Orangeburg
,
SC
,
were
killed
by
state
highway
patrolmen
,
who
opened
fire
on
a
crowd
of
unarmed
college
students
.
Two
years
later
,
similar
shooting
deaths
occurred
at
Jackson
State
University
,
another
HBCU
in
Mississippi
,
and
most
famously
at
Kent
State
University
,
where
four
white
students
were
killed
by
National
Guards
.
This
violence
was
reflective
of
the
tumult
of
the
era
,
where
students
across
the
nation
not
only
made
demands
for
change
in
the
nation
,
but
at
the
very
institutions
that
were
charged
with
preparing
them
for
the
future
;
a
future
that
many
of
these
institutions
were
unprepared
for
the
future
that
those
students
demanded
.
Duke
was
such
an
institution
.
Like
every
protest
,
the
Allen
Building
Takeover
was
not
unique
there
were
student
strikes
at
San
Francisco
State
University
and
an
armed
student
takeover
at
Cornell
University
that
occurred
only
two
months
after
the
Allen
Building
Takeover
,
mirroring
the
outbreak
of
sit
ins
that
went
viral
in
the
Spring
of
1960
after
four
Black
students
from
North
Carolina
A
amp
;
T
,
another
HBCU
,
famously
began
a
movement
by
sitting
down
at
a
segregated
lunch
counter
at
a
Greensboro
Woolworth’s
department
store
.
The
Allen
Building
Takeover
was
singular
,
though
,
because
of
what
it
meant
for
the
future
of
Duke
and
the
city
of
Durham
.
With
the
integrating
of
Duke
in
1963
Mary
Mitchell
Harris
,
Gene
Kendall
,
Wilhelmina
Reuben
Cooke
,
Cassandra
Smith
Rush
,
Nathaniel
B
.
White
,
Jr
.
,
forever
known
as
the
First
Five
and
campuses
across
the
nation
,
the
political
passions
and
activism
that
were
gestating
at
Historically
Black
Colleges
and
Universities
began
to
flower
.
That
flowering
at
Duke
took
shape
in
the
Spring
of
1968
,
immediately
after
the
shooting
death
of
Martin
Luther
King
,
Jr
.
,
with
the
Silent
Vigil
,
remembered
as
the
largest
student
protest
in
the
history
of
the
university
.
Among
those
student
demands
,
were
increased
wages
and
the
right
to
collective
bargaining
among
Duke’s
non
academic
workers
many
of
whom
were
Black
Durhamites
,
who
never
had
the
opportunity
to
attend
an
institution
like
Duke
.
That
flowering
was
in
full
bloom
on
February
13
,
1969
when
dozens
of
Black
students
occupied
the
Allen
Building
,
supported
outside
by
White
allies
who
could
bear
witness
to
their
demands
for
a
public
unprepared
for
the
rage
that
had
been
bubbling
within
a
generation
that
was
no
longer
going
to
be
denied
access
to
their
dreams
.
The
first
of
the
demands
by
those
students
who
occupied
the
Allen
Building
was
for
the
formations
of
a
fully
accredited
Department
of
Afro
American
Studies
.
I
write
today
as
the
James
B
.
Duke
Professor
and
Chair
of
the
nationally
and
internationally
renowned
Department
of
African
amp
;
African
American
Studies
,
in
large
part
,
because
of
the
vision
and
bravery
of
those
students
50
years
ago
.
It
speaks
volumes
that
the
Allen
Building
Takeover
has
resonated
for
virtually
every
generation
of
student
activist
at
Duke
over
the
last
five
decades
that
a
full
50
years
later
,
it
is
a
beacon
of
possibility
for
a
generation
of
Asian
and
Asian
American
students
making
their
claim
on
,
not
just
diversity
at
Duke
,
but
real
inclusion
.
Duke
is
not
what
it
once
was
,
but
it
certainly
is
not
where
in
needs
to
be
.
We
can
thank
those
brave
souls
of
50
years
ago
for
always
making
that
clear
to
us
.
When
I
was
a
kid
,
I
was
always
excited
by
the
chance
to
visit
Duke’s
campus
.
The
reason
?
The
prospect
of
riding
the
PRT
.
For
those
who
may
not
be
familiar
,
the
PRT
an
acronym
for
Personal
Rapid
Transit
was
a
tram
system
that
ran
about
a
quarter
mile
between
Duke
South
,
Duke
North
and
a
parking
garage
across
the
street
from
the
hospitals
.
The
vehicles
floated
on
a
bed
of
compressed
air
and
moved
via
linear
induction
system
that
propelled
them
along
guideways
.
It
was
a
futuristic
achievement
that
was
technologically
sophisticated
for
its
time
.
More
importantly
,
it
was
built
out
of
a
sense
of
aspiration
to
use
a
transportation
project
to
create
a
better
,
more
connected
Duke
.
The
reason
for
the
PRT
was
to
solve
the
problem
of
making
one
hospital
out
of
two
physical
plants
,
’
The
Chronicle
wrote
in
1979
to
announce
its
opening
.
By
the
mid
90s
,
the
system
carried
3
,
000
patients
and
passengers
daily
in
and
around
Duke
Hospital
,
according
to
an
article
in
the
Herald
Sun
.
For
a
variety
of
reasons
including
hospital
expansion
and
aging
infrastructure
,
the
system
was
decommissioned
in
2009
.
In
some
ways
,
it
was
a
victim
of
its
own
success
.
The
hospital’s
operations
were
now
so
intertwined
between
campuses
that
it
was
less
necessary
.
This
year
is
the
40th
anniversary
of
the
inauguration
of
the
PRT
.
But
it
is
also
the
year
Duke
must
make
some
important
decisions
regarding
the
future
of
another
transit
system
the
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
Transit
project
.
Unfortunately
,
Duke’s
refusal
to
sign
a
cooperative
agreement
in
support
of
the
project
in
time
for
an
important
Feb
.
28
deadline
is
putting
the
project’s
entire
fate
in
peril
.
During
ongoing
negotiations
,
Duke
has
raised
numerous
issues
with
the
proposal
,
and
community
leaders
have
responded
thoughtfully
.
Although
it
is
fair
for
the
University
to
express
concerns
about
the
project
as
a
major
stakeholder
,
the
administration’s
11th
hour
litany
of
complaints
is
frustrating
.
It’s
hard
not
to
see
this
as
an
effort
to
disrupt
the
project
or
as
a
negotiating
tactic
to
secure
more
taxpayer
funded
concessions
.
At
the
very
least
,
it
would
have
been
more
prudent
for
Duke’s
relationship
with
our
community
to
raise
these
concerns
earlier
.
Whatever
their
motivation
,
the
concerns
raised
which
include
traffic
interruptions
,
vibration
and
electromagnetic
interference
are
primarily
technical
in
nature
.
Solutions
exist
and
are
already
working
in
other
communities
around
the
world
.
Years
ago
,
when
designing
and
building
the
PRT
,
Duke’s
team
did
not
shy
away
from
such
technical
challenges
.
The
system
was
heralded
in
a
NASA
publication
for
its
use
of
a
buffering
technology
developed
by
engineers
to
assist
with
moon
landings
.
It
employed
complex
microprocessors
to
provide
automation
and
interface
with
a
central
control
room
.
And
its
builders
even
included
a
drawbridge
to
allow
coal
train
cars
to
access
Duke’s
steam
plant
.
The
aspirational
vision
for
an
interconnected
healthcare
system
was
achieved
because
of
these
innovations
.
What
is
so
important
about
the
light
rail
system
even
though
it
will
come
at
a
major
cost
is
that
it
will
serve
to
guide
our
region’s
growth
in
productive
ways
over
the
next
decades
.
It
is
part
of
as
a
community
,
one
that
Durham
voters
overwhelmingly
approved
in
a
2011
tax
referendum
.
To
be
sure
,
light
rail
is
not
a
cure
all
for
the
challenges
the
Durham
community
faces
,
but
it
is
an
important
tool
to
drive
dense
,
diverse
and
liveable
growth
in
the
city
we
love
.
And
it
is
part
of
a
vision
Duke
should
lead
rather
than
derail
.
Someday
soon
,
kids
,
employees
and
families
from
the
community
could
be
arriving
on
campus
in
a
train
.
That’s
the
vision
a
more
interconnected
Duke
and
Durham
.
Upon
meeting
with
all
Young
Trustee
candidates
individually
,
Blue
Devils
United
is
excited
to
endorse
candidate
Trey
Walk
for
the
role
of
Young
Trustee
.
We
believe
that
Trey
has
had
a
strong
track
record
of
creating
positive
change
in
the
Duke
community
,
and
demonstrates
an
unparalleled
understanding
of
the
systemic
roots
of
Duke’s
institutional
shortcomings
particularly
regarding
LGBTQ
affairs
.
We
believe
that
his
lived
experiences
and
knack
for
building
relationships
through
listening
will
serve
to
better
inform
his
decisions
,
as
well
as
that
of
other
members
,
on
the
board
.
During
Blue
Devils
United’s
deliberations
,
Trey
garnered
the
vote
of
all
general
body
and
exec
members
present
.
This
was
informed
by
the
overwhelming
sentiment
that
Trey’s
extensive
experiences
in
grassroots
advocacy
for
underrepresented
members
of
the
local
community
will
translate
into
a
well
informed
and
refreshing
perspective
for
the
Duke
board
.
We
hope
that
Trey
will
persist
in
his
efforts
to
use
human
experience
,
information
and
goal
setting
to
educate
and
steer
the
board
towards
making
equitable
decisions
.
We
wish
him
,
and
all
the
other
candidates
,
best
of
luck
in
the
upcoming
elections
!

Executive
Board
Duke
students
will
move
into
Krzyzewskiville
Saturday
for
the
start
of
black
tenting
.
I
don’t
just
tent
for
the
Carolina
game
.
Yes
,
the
game
is
usually
the
highlight
of
the
tenting
season
,
but
I
wouldn’t
tent
if
I
didn’t
enjoy
spending
time
bonding
with
11
of
my
friends
.
But
I
am
also
a
die
hard
fan
,
and
as
a
Duke
student
,
I
really
enjoy
cheering
for
all
of
my
fellow
Blue
Devils
.
But
we
want
to
be
the
center
of
attention
,
and
often
our
self
centeredness
comes
at
the
expense
of
our
peers
.
Being
a
part
of
the
greatest
fanbase
in
the
world
is
definitely
an
added
bonus
to
being
a
Duke
fan
,
but
when
we’re
just
going
to
games
for
the
pictures
and
so
we
can
end
up
on
TV
something
is
not
quite
right
.
The
center
of
attention
at
games
is
the
team
we
wouldn’t
be
able
to
be
crazy
if
we
didn’t
have
the
guys
out
on
the
court
.
We
are
at
games
because
of
the
team
,
and
we
have
to
support
them
.
As
students
,
we
can’t
just
be
fair
weather
fans
.
We
can’t
heckle
our
talented
team
by
shouting
,
asshole
!
at
them
when
they
miss
a
shot
because
they’re
stressed
out
.
I
know
you
might’ve
just
tented
because
you
wanted
to
get
a
picture
of
yourself
in
front
of
the
burning
benches
,
but
we
as
tenters
aren’t
the
only
ones
who’ve
put
in
a
lot
of
work
to
get
to
this
point
.
Our
team
has
devoted
their
entire
lives
to
this
game
,
so
if
we’re
going
to
pretend
to
be
fans
,
we
should
know
that
they
deserve
more
support
than
just
re
posting
A
Single
Shade
of
Blue
and
then
focusing
more
on
Obama’s
presence
at
the
game
than
the
game
itself
.
At
least
a
quarter
of
the
student
body
wanted
to
tent
,
and
a
lot
of
deserving
students
didn’t
get
a
chance
to
go
to
the
game
.

Did

Did
you
cheer
on
our
team

Students
took
over
the
Allen
Building
in
1969
to
demand
racial
equality
on
campus
,
one
of
many
organized
student
efforts
to
influence
administrators
.
Thank
you
for
soliciting
our
memories
on
the
50th
anniversary
of
the
Allen
Building
takeover
.
One
of
this
past
week’s
events
nearly
brought
me
to
tears
.
I
viewed
the
library
exhibit
and
attended
a
discussion
at
the
Mary
Lou
Williams
Center
,
where
I
again
saw
the
list
of
demands
by
the
African
American
students
.
One
was
to
increase
the
population
of
black
students
at
Duke
to
29
percent
by
1973
.
This
demand
was
so
powerful
to
me
because
I
matriculated
to
Duke
in
you
guessed
it
1973
.
That
demand
,
read
today
,
almost
felt
like
they
asked
for
me
by
name
.
My
fellow
African
American
freshmen
and
I
heard
a
lot
about
the
takeover
only
four
years
earlier
,
and
we
knew
that
our
large
class
80
was
a
result
of
Duke
heeding
the
call
to
increase
our
numbers
.
In
1973
,
there
were
only
four
black
women
in
Southgate
among
the
175
co
ed
residents
.
To
make
sure
we
were
represented
in
the
dorm
meetings
,
I
ran
for
office
,
and
became
Freshmen
Rep
,
then
Vice
President
,
then
President
.
Senior
year
,
I
became
an
RA
.
Our
voices
were
definitely
heard
in
Southgate
.
The
Modern
Black
Mass
Choir
,
Dance
Black
,
Durham
churches
,
and
Duke’s
African
American
employees
literally
gave
us
a
sense
of
home
and
identity
.
Black
fraternities
and
sororities
began
in
1973
74
,
when
so
many
first
generation
students
knew
nothing
of
Greek
life
.
Bobby
Durrah
became
our
first
black
Blue
Devil
.
Other
memories
weren’t
so
great
an
F
in
Intro
to
New
Testament
from
a
visiting
professor
after
I’d
taught
Sunday
School
since
age
14
,
Duke’s
dismissal
of
many
friends
for
academic
performance
,
and
woefully
few
black
faculty
.
However
,
my
best
memories
were
centered
around
my
family
all
the
black
undergrads
,
grad
students
and
especially
alumni
,
who
were
always
there
for
us
.
We
survived
Duke
together
,
and
today
we
are
more
than
friends
and
classmates
.
We’re
literally
brothers
and
sisters
,
with
bonds
so
deep
they
can
never
be
broken
.
I'd
also
like
to
direct
your
attention
,
in
this
50th
year
Allen
Building
anniversary
,
to
two
Duke
publications
that
were
very
important
to
the
African
American
community
at
the
time
they
appeared
.
I
was
fortunate
to
have
two
of
my
poems
published
in
these
publications
.
First
,
the
1974
Chanticleer
Vol
.
62
contained
what
we
believed
at
the
time
was
the
first
inclusion
of
African
American
students
in
the
yearbook
,
where
10
pages
of
photos
of
black
students
and
the
black
community
,
along
with
my
poem
,
In
Contradiction
of
America
Is
My
Home
were
included
,
surrounded
by
black
background
pages
pp
.
102
112
.
We
were
elated
at
the
time
that
the
student
editors
and
staff
of
the
Chanticleer
recognized
our
presence
on
campus
in
the
1974
yearbook
.
Second
,
I
was
also
honored
to
represent
us
in
the
Fall
1974
literary
publication
,
The
Archive
Vol
.
87
,
nbsp
;
number
1
,
where
my
poem
,
Bubble
Gum
Machine
was
published
.
To
have
been
a
freshman
and
have
my
words
permanently
included
in
the
history
of
Duke
still
remains
among
the
highlights
of
my
time
at
Duke
University
,
and
is
part
of
the
history
of
African
American
students
who
have
attended
our
great
university
.
Perhaps
this
shows
how
far
we
had
come
after
the
courageous
stand
taken
by
our
alumni
brothers
and
sisters
during
the
Allen
Building
takeover
.
Dear
President
Price
We
,
the
undersigned
Duke
organizations
,
faculty
,
staff
and
alumni
,
appreciate
that
Duke
University
has
worked
with
GoTriangle
to
discuss
its
concerns
regarding
the
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
transit
project
DOLRT
.
The
vitality
of
the
Triangle
region
depends
on
an
excellent
public
transit
system
,
and
this
light
rail
is
a
crucial
component
.
The
benefits
for
Durham
residents
are
numerous
,
including
1
affordable
housing
,
2
increased
access
to
jobs
,
care
,
and
education
,
3
environmental
benefits
,
and
4
return
on
investment
.
As
an
institution
dedicated
to
increasing
opportunity
for
all
,
it
is
the
University’s
moral
responsibility
to
uplift
our
region
by
supporting
the
successful
development
of
the
light
rail
.
President
Price
,
will
you
contribute
the
necessary
land
to
the
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
and
sign
the
cooperative
agreement
with
GoTriangle
by
the
end
of
February
?
In
the
next
25
years
,
the
Triangle
region
will
grow
by
1
million
people
.
To
meet
that
growth
while
simultaneously
preserving
quality
of
life
,
the
Triangle
will
need
to
invest
in
transit
systems
that
reduce
traffic
congestion
.
A
light
rail
must
be
part
of
that
solution
if
we
are
to
match
the
practices
of
other
growing
metropolitan
areas
.
Accessible
transit
is
also
essential
for
affordable
housing
.
Seven
out
of
every
10
homes
owned
by
the
Durham
Housing
Authority
DHA
are
within
a
mile
of
a
proposed
light
rail
station
.
The
light
rail’s
high
degree
of
accessibility
allows
the
DHA
to
receive
more
funding
for
affordable
housing
from
federal
programs
that
value
interconnected
transit
.
Duke
must
be
a
part
of
increasing
housing
options
for
low
and
moderate
income
residents
if
it
values
the
overall
well
being
of
the
Triangle
area
.
Second
,
the
light
rail
will
increase
access
to
workplaces
,
health
care
facilities
and
education
.
The
light
rail
is
designed
to
pass
through
three
of
the
top
10
employers
in
the
state
.
Local
communities
,
including
the
tens
of
thousands
of
Durham
residents
who
do
not
own
cars
and
have
been
geographically
isolated
from
job
opportunities
,
will
now
have
much
needed
access
to
employment
.
The
light
rail
would
also
connect
the
UNC
and
Duke
healthcare
systems
,
thereby
enhancing
the
region’s
ability
to
provide
excellent
patient
care
to
the
maximum
number
of
people
.
As
one
of
the
nation’s
premiere
leaders
in
healthcare
,
Duke
University
has
the
opportunity
and
obligation
to
stand
at
the
forefront
of
a
project
that
can
dramatically
improve
health
services
.
Third
,
the
light
rail
will
allow
the
region
to
save
80
billion
BTUs
of
energy
every
year
that
it
operates
.
This
technology
will
improve
air
quality
and
further
the
region’s
commitment
to
finding
low
carbon
transportation
solutions
.
Duke
prides
itself
on
its
environmental
leadership
,
both
on
campus
and
in
the
community
,
and
the
University’s
support
of
the
light
rail
serves
as
a
tangible
step
in
solidifying
that
legacy
.
Finally
,
multiple
studies
have
highlighted
the
profound
economic
impacts
of
the
light
rail
.
The
light
rail
will
support
nearly
30
,
000
new
jobs
in
Durham
and
Orange
Counties
alone
.
It
will
also
bring
175
million
in
new
annual
tax
revenues
to
the
cities
,
counties
,
and
state
.
The
University
is
in
the
position
to
be
a
part
of
that
growth
,
which
will
support
generations
of
residents
and
businesses
to
come
.
We
recognize
that
as
a
Level
1
trauma
center
,
Duke
Health
must
consider
the
implications
that
construction
may
have
on
patient
care
and
emergency
access
.
GoTriangle
has
a
list
of
20
medical
centers
across
the
country
with
rail
systems
in
close
proximity
that
can
serve
as
examples
of
how
solutions
can
be
found
through
cooperation
.
GoTriangle
has
also
made
good
faith
efforts
to
carefully
address
Duke’s
concerns
by
adjusting
routes
,
altering
construction
activities
,
fundraising
millions
of
dollars
for
changes
,
and
offering
to
hire
design
consultants
that
specialize
in
health
systems
.
To
reduce
any
noise
disruptions
to
patients
,
GoTriangle
has
agreed
to
meet
the
most
stringent
vibration
thresholds
presented
by
Duke
Medical
Center
.
All
of
these
changes
have
been
performed
at
Duke’s
request
as
a
means
of
greatly
minimizing
hospital
disturbances
and
maintaining
Duke
Health’s
high
level
of
care
.
Now
,
it
is
Duke’s
turn
to
be
a
good
neighbor
and
support
the
light
rail
.
The
purpose
of
the
cooperative
agreement
between
GoTriangle
and
Duke
is
to
commit
to
working
together
to
address
any
remaining
issues
.
The
UNC
Healthcare
System
,
another
excellent
provider
of
health
services
,
has
already
signed
its
own
cooperative
agreement
with
the
intention
of
collaborating
further
with
GoTriangle
to
resolve
any
remaining
concerns
about
patient
care
.
This
means
that
no
single
plan
of
design
has
to
be
finalized
by
the
end
of
February
.
However
,
if
Duke
does
not
agree
to
donate
its
land
by
the
end
of
February
,
the
light
rail
will
not
be
able
to
meet
deadlines
for
crucial
federal
funding
.
Without
Duke’s
support
,
all
of
the
affordable
housing
benefits
,
economic
development
and
low
carbon
solutions
that
the
light
rail
offers
will
disappear
.
The
20
years
of
effort
that
city
officials
,
transit
authorities
,
and
community
members
have
invested
in
the
project
will
go
to
waste
.
The
University
has
a
chance
to
prove
its
dedication
to
the
vitality
of
our
region
and
to
demonstrate
its
genuine
willingness
for
collaboration
.
President
Price
,
for
the
many
compelling
reasons
outlined
herein
,
we
call
on
you
to
donate
the
necessary
land
to
the
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
and
to
sign
the
cooperative
agreement
with
GoTriangle
by
the
end
of
February
.
Sincerely
,
It’s
a
tale
as
old
as
time
you
enter
a
movie
theater
with
the
intention
of
escaping
reality
at
least
for
the
duration
of
the
film
.
The
lights
dim
,
the
darkness
swaddles
you
in
a
cozy
trance
and
you
briefly
trade
your
own
world
for
an
exciting
and
emotional
glimpse
into
someone
else’s
.
Your
fingers
,
which
are
greasy
from
the
warm
,
buttery
drip
of
that
famous
movie
theater
popcorn
,
plunge
into
the
medium
sized
bag
between
your
knees
,
blindly
grope
for
another
handful
of
Hollywood’s
sweet
ambrosia
and
move
mechanically
to
your
lips
in
an
endless
cycle
.
Then
,
just
as
the
plot
reaches
its
climax
,
as
all
the
answers
you
have
so
desperately
been
yearning
for
are
about
to
spill
into
your
eager
lap
,
the
movie
is
drowned
out
by
the
startling
and
familiar
sound
of
the
21st
Century
a
cell
phone
.
This
epidemic
,
guaranteed
to
disturb
almost
every
movie
going
experience
,
is
so
ubiquitous
that
most
theaters
have
taken
to
shaming
their
customers
into
not
being
That
Guy
through
warning
commercials
that
often
precede
the
film
.
While
these
commercials
tend
to
be
humorous
and
light
hearted
,
they
ultimately
strive
to
prevent
the
eye
rolls
,
glares
,
furrowed
brows
and
extreme
frustration
that
is
inevitably
exuded
by
disrupted
movie
goers
.
A
similar
frustration
in
which
the
masses
come
together
to
exert
a
dramatic
eye
roll
,
a
deafening
sigh
,
or
small
but
profound
smirks
of
mockery
is
notoriously
fostered
in
the
classroom
,
and
manifests
in
response
to
more
avid
participants
.
Beginning
as
young
as
elementary
school
,
students
are
taught
to
speak
,
engage
and
share
their
ideas
with
their
fellow
pupils
.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
question
,
teachers
will
sing
;
all
ideas
are
good
ideas
.
With
these
mantras
in
mind
,
many
students
quickly
learn
to
raise
their
hands
,
while
others
slump
lower
in
their
chairs
,
living
in
constant
fear
of
being
called
on
.
I
have
always
been
one
of
the
more
enthusiastic
classroom
participants
,
and
I
often
find
myself
jumping
to
answer
questions
my
right
arm
shooting
quickly
into
the
air
even
before
I
fully
digest
what’s
being
asked
.
After
all
,
a
great
way
to
retain
information
and
assess
your
understanding
of
a
concept
is
to
see
how
well
you
can
engage
with
it
.
However
,
as
the
years
have
melted
by
and
I’ve
graduated
from
vaguely
titled
science
classes
in
elementary
school
to
more
complex
and
demanding
Duke
courses
,
I’ve
noticed
an
increasing
stigma
towards
over
participators
.
It
is
as
though
there
is
an
invisible
,
yet
unmistakable
line
on
the
ground
,
separating
those
who
make
a
single
insightful
comment
each
class
from
the
people
who
repeatedly
raise
their
hand
,
frequently
vocalizing
their
beliefs
,
verbally
working
out
the
material
and
asking
an
abundance
of
questions
.
Don’t
get
me
wrong
,
I
definitely
associate
with
the
latter
,
and
through
membership
of
this
talkative
group
,
I’ve
become
familiar
with
a
startling
phenomenon
a
pervasive
,
please
stop
volunteering
to
speak
,
Don’t
be
That
Guy
sentiment
.
A
couple
weeks
ago
,
as
my
class
concluded
and
students
began
to
pack
up
their
belongings
and
leave
the
room
,
my
professor
shouted
Wait
a
second
.
You
guys
are
going
to
have
to
tell
me
how
I
can
get
you
to
participate
.
This
class
only
works
if
you
participate
.
Silence
broken
up
by
a
few
awkward
or
guilty
?
chuckles
filled
the
room
,
until
one
person
responded
,
You
could
give
us
food
.
We
all
laughed
,
greatly
amused
at
the
idea
that
a
Duke
Professor
,
who
we
are
be
that
guy
.
’
When
I
read
Ali
Thursland's
column
on
being
financially
underprivileged
at
Duke
,
I
related
to
a
lot
of
her
struggles
.
I
am
a
low
income
,
first
generation
student
and
a
member
of
a
Greek
organization
.
How
many
birthday
dinners
have
I
missed
because
I
can’t
afford
a
meal
out
?
How
many
times
have
I
lied
about
where
my
clothes
are
from
?
How
many
times
have
I
skipped
a
mixer
or
party
because
I
have
nothing
to
wear
?
But
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
have
also
lied
about
why
I
would
drive
home
12
hours
instead
of
flying
,
or
about
where
my
brother
,
sister
and
parents
went
to
college
.
I
have
had
to
uncomfortably
explain
why
I
stayed
at
Duke
for
Thanksgiving
,
why
I
have
two
jobs
,
and
why
I
didn’t
go
abroad
.
All
of
these
struggles
are
real
.
When
I
read
Angelica
Pangan’s
piece
in
response
to
Ali’s
article
,
I
felt
like
my
struggles
were
invalidated
.
This
is
something
I
have
felt
frequently
I
don’t
belong
in
Greek
life
because
I
am
low
income
,
but
I
am
also
not
accepted
by
other
low
income
or
first
generation
students
because
I
like
to
go
to
frat
parties
,
Shooters
,
etc
.
To
me
,
Angelica’s
letter
served
to
reinforce
the
idea
that
social
life
at
Duke
is
only
for
the
wealthy
majority
;
that
,
because
I
am
poor
,
I
should
abstain
from
these
activities
.
But
when
only
12
percent
of
students
at
Duke
receive
Pell
grants
,
why
are
we
attacking
each
other’s
experiences
instead
of
providing
a
community
of
support
for
each
other
?
At
Duke
,
I
am
overwhelmingly
used
to
my
wealthier
peers
not
understanding
my
financial
struggles
,
but
I
am
deeply
saddened
when
they
are
invalidated
by
my
less
wealthy
peers
.
When
I
came
to
Duke
,
I
wanted
to
be
like
everyone
else
,
but
I
quickly
realized
I
wasn’t
.
I
wanted
to
join
a
sorority
in
the
spring
,
but
I
knew
I
needed
to
hide
who
I
really
was
to
do
that
,
and
I
did
.
I
was
constantly
lying
about
being
low
income
and
first
generation
and
it
took
a
toll
.
After
my
first
year
,
I
felt
like
I
didn’t
belong
here
,
and
I
was
tired
of
lying
.
But
to
say
that
these
aren’t
real
or
fundamental
ramifications
of
being
low
income
at
Duke
is
hurtful
and
wrong
.
I
waited
until
my
sophomore
year
to
be
honest
with
my
friends
about
my
financial
and
family
situation
nbsp
;
and
am
incredibly
lucky
to
have
a
group
of
friends
who
have
been
so
supportive
of
me
.
Because
of
them
,
I
have
been
able
to
go
on
spring
break
and
fall
break
trips
,
I
can
be
honest
about
not
being
able
to
afford
a
meal
or
night
out
,
and
they
have
always
been
incredibly
generous
to
me
.
This
has
made
my
Duke
experience
unforgettable
and
I
am
forever
grateful
to
them
.
Because
of
my
friends
,
I
can
more
easily
go
out
and
do
things
with
them
,
but
the
social
ramifications
of
being
poor
are
still
present
in
every
part
of
my
life
.
I
still
stress
about
affording
my
textbooks
,
toiletries
,
gas
and
tickets
home
.
I
worry
every
time
I
have
to
call
an
Uber
or
buy
a
meal
without
food
points
.
I
dread
spending
any
money
on
alcohol
,
themed
outfits
or
formal
dresses
.
And
although
some
of
these
struggles
may
seem
small
,
unnecessary
or
impulsive
,
they
have
had
a
massive
impact
on
my
Duke
experience
.
Don’t
reduce
my
struggles
because
of
my
choice
not
to
be
submissive
in
the
social
hierarchies
at
Duke
.
I
will
not
let
who
I
am
limit
where
I
am
and
am
not
accepted
on
campus
,
and
I
won’t
be
shamed
for
it
,
either
.
There
are
endless
social
ramifications
of
being
low
income
at
Duke
,
and
they
all
are
valid
.
Finally
,
we
are
not
financially
underprivileged
.
We
are
low
income
and
should
not
be
ashamed
to
use
that
term
.

As
chair
of
the
Durham
Chapel
Hill
Carrboro
Metropolitan
Planning
Organization
,
which
coordinates
transportation
planning
in
the
western
Triangle
,
I
have
the
privilege
of
working
with
leaders
of
Durham
and
other
local
governments
to
plan
the
region’s
transportation
investments
.
The
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
Transit
Project
is
one
of
those
investments
.
It
is
a
high
priority
for
our
communities
and
the
first
project
in
the
Triangle’s
major
public
transit
infrastructure
.
As
a
longtime
Duke
employee
,
I
have
the
privilege
of
working
with
researchers
at
the
top
of
their
fields
and
with
Duke
students
,
employees
and
alums
whose
vision
and
leadership
are
helping
make
the
community
a
better
place
.
We
need
to
see
vision
and
leadership
in
Duke’s
dealings
with
the
people
of
Durham
on
the
light
rail
project
.
Over
several
years
,
the
people
of
Durham
and
Orange
Counties
,
through
our
tax
dollars
,
have
made
multiple
commitments
to
address
questions
from
Duke
administrators
related
to
the
light
rail
project
.
We
agreed
to
shift
and
elevate
the
tracks
on
Erwin
Road
.
We
agreed
to
move
a
station
.
We
paid
engineers
to
study
alternative
routes
.
We
agreed
to
build
a
pedestrian
connection
between
the
Duke
and
VA
hospitals
.
We
agreed
to
include
more
technology
to
improve
access
to
Duke
Hospital
.
We
continue
to
pay
engineers
to
study
other
design
modifications
.
We
made
these
changes
at
great
expense
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
not
because
they
are
necessary
to
operate
an
excellent
light
rail
service
in
Durham
,
but
in
response
to
Duke
.
Today
,
Durham
and
its
partners
are
counting
on
Duke
to
sign
a
cooperative
agreement
to
bring
into
reality
this
transformative
project
that
means
so
much
for
the
future
of
the
city
and
the
region
.
We
need
a
partner
who
will
work
with
us
in
good
faith
,
a
partner
who
will
make
a
true
commitment
to
the
community
in
which
they
live
,
a
partner
who
will
be
a
good
citizen
.
I
hope
and
believe
Duke
can
find
a
way
to
be
that
partner
.
I
am
writing
to
express
my
surprise
that
the
search
committee
for
a
new
Executive
Vice
President
will
include
no
students
,
as
was
reported
in
the
nbsp
;
Chronicle
.
For
a
position
with
such
a
substantial
impact
on
the
future
of
Duke
University
,
I
would
think
that
having
student
voices
in
the
room
when
the
decision
is
made
about
who
to
hire
is
vital
.
Students
at
Duke
are
the
lifeblood
of
the
institution
,
and
a
vital
constituency
for
long
term
decisions
about
our
strategic
direction
of
the
university
.
We
serve
on
the
Board
of
Trustees
and
in
almost
every
other
level
of
University
governance
,
as
well
as
on
past
leadership
search
committees
.
It
seems
to
me
that
students
should
have
a
seat
at
the
table
rather
than
merely
being
solicited
for
input
by
a
body
in
which
they
have
no
part
.
In
the
highly
orchestrated
theater
of
the
fourth
impeaching
proceedings
in
the
history
of
the
United
States
,
it
can
be
easy
to
lose
the
human
element
that
underlies
witnesses’
testimony
.
But
on
Tuesday
,
it
was
impossible
to
sit
in
room
1100
of
the
Longworth
Congressional
Building
without
feeling
the
humanity
that
infused
the
testimony
of
Lieutenant
Colonel
Alexander
Vindman
.
I
am
currently
a
PhD
candidate
,
studying
animal
behavior
in
the
Duke
biology
department
,
but
in
my
undergraduate
studies
I
also
pursued
political
science
and
have
maintained
an
interest
in
political
behavior
ever
since
.
As
an
avid
institutionalist
,
I
was
moved
to
attend
the
impeachment
hearings
in
Washington
to
witness
firsthand
the
profound
Constitutional
challenge
that
is
currently
unfolding
.
I
chose
to
time
my
visit
to
coincide
with
Lt
.
Colonel
Vindman’s
testimony
,
as
I
had
long
perceived
him
to
be
an
exemplar
of
American
patriotism
.
I
was
not
disappointed
.
As
he
began
his
opening
statement
,
Vindman
was
clearly
out
of
his
element
testifying
before
the
House
Permanent
Select
Committee
on
Intelligence
and
millions
of
Americans
.
But
as
he
walked
us
through
his
life
story
,
a
story
that
exemplifies
the
American
dream
,
he
grew
in
confidence
and
his
voice
grew
in
strength
.
Following
the
death
of
his
mother
,
Vindman’s
father
took
his
family
and
fled
the
Soviet
Union
with
the
hope
of
building
a
free
life
in
the
United
States
.
He
testified
that
his
father
taught
him
an
important
lesson
America
is
your
home
and
has
given
you
an
opportunity
.
It
is
your
duty
to
embrace
that
opportunity
and
give
back
.
Vindman
heeded
his
father’s
lesson
,
training
as
an
Army
reserve
officer
in
college
,
joining
the
Army
as
a
commissioned
officer
after
his
graduation
,
and
remaining
an
officer
in
the
Army
for
the
two
decades
since
.
He
expressed
a
clear
sense
of
duty
that
he
felt
throughout
his
life
to
place
love
of
country
above
love
of
self
.
It
was
that
sense
of
duty
to
place
America’s
interests
before
his
own
that
forced
Vindman
to
place
his
career
and
reputation
in
jeopardy
.
Following
a
July
25
call
between
President
Trump
and
Ukrainian
President
Volodymyr
Zelinksy
,
in
which
Vindman
witnessed
President
Trump
demand
that
Zelinsky
initiate
a
political
investigation
into
former
Vice
President
Biden
,
Vindman
was
faced
with
a
nbsp
;
choice
that
might
paralyze
someone
with
less
patriotic
vigor
.
He
had
to
choose
whether
to
report
his
concerns
about
what
he
knew
to
be
an
improper
request
,
thereby
putting
himself
at
odds
with
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
.
But
for
Vindman
,
the
choice
was
not
a
difficult
one
.
Indeed
,
it
was
not
even
a
choice
.
His
duty
to
country
demanded
that
he
report
his
concerns
,
and
he
immediately
did
so
.
After
accounting
for
committee
members
,
aides
,
journalists
,
and
the
general
public
,
there
were
close
to
300
people
in
the
room
,
hanging
on
every
word
of
Vindman’s
testimony
.
To
nearly
all
present
,
the
depth
of
Colonel
Vindman’s
patriotism
and
love
of
country
could
not
have
been
more
apparent
.
Looking
around
my
fellow
observers
,
emotion
was
on
every
face
.
And
yet
,
the
nine
Republican
members
of
the
committee
managed
to
find
room
in
their
hearts
and
minds
to
doubt
not
only
the
testimony
of
facts
that
Vindman
offered
,
but
to
question
his
loyalty
to
the
America
.
To
be
clear
,
not
every
Republican
member
suggested
that
Vindman’s
true
allegiance
was
to
Ukraine
rather
than
to
America
or
suggested
that
he
had
inflated
his
job
responsibilities
and
expertise
.
And
not
every
Republican
member
questioned
why
he
had
worn
his
uniform
to
testify
or
why
he
insisted
on
being
referred
to
by
his
title
.
But
not
one
of
them
said
a
word
to
stop
their
fellow
members’
attacks
that
task
fell
to
the
Democrats
.
Sadly
,
while
Vindman’s
actions
were
guided
entirely
by
patriotism
,
Republicans’
actions
were
guided
entirely
by
partisanship
.
Watching
the
impeachment
proceedings
unfold
,
where
the
facts
all
fall
so
clearly
against
the
President
,
one
has
to
wonder
,
How
did
he
think
that
he
could
get
away
with
it
?
The
reason
is
that
the
President
,
Mick
Mulvaney
,
and
Mike
Pompeo
did
not
realize
that
there
would
be
people
exposed
to
their
scheme
that
would
not
stand
for
it
.
They
did
not
realize
that
there
would
be
people
,
like
Lt
.
Colonel
Vindman
,
who
would
put
their
country
first
before
party
,
career
,
or
personal
security
.
The
President
and
those
closest
to
him
cannot
understand
what
drove
Lt
.
Colonel
Vindman
to
speak
out
.
They
cannot
understand
his
actions
,
because
while
President
Trump
and
his
co
conspirators
are
driven
driven
by
partisanship
and
personal
gain
,
Vindman
is
motivated
by
patriotism
.
To
quote
the
man
himself
,
I’d
call
myself
a
never
partisan
I’m
an
American
here
,
right
matters
.
Anybody
who
has
spent
at
least
a
few
hours
on
the
Internet
in
the
last
few
weeks
has
witnessed
the
speedy
ascent
of
the
meme
OK
Boomer
,
’
which
even
has
its
own
Wikipedia
page
now
.
If
you
have
been
living
under
a
rock
,
the
phrase
is
typically
used
as
a
response
by
younger
internet
users
to
older
Baby
Boomers
who
engage
in
some
form
of
stereotypically
Boomer’
behavior
,
or
advocate
for
a
certain
set
of
politics
that
younger
people
have
deemed
as
unacceptable
.
A
recent
Chronicle
article
highlighted
the
problem
of
assuming
that
Boomers
are
always
correct
,
simply
because
of
their
age
and
platform
,
and
this
is
no
doubt
true
.
Boomers
are
not
perfect
;
far
from
it
.
As
Ryan
McMaken
writes
for
the
Mises
Institute
,
The
older
I
get
,
the
more
I
realize
how
very
wrong
I
was
to
ever
think
that
a
disproportionate
number
of
people
older
than
me
possessed
some
sort
of
special
knowledge
about
how
to
properly
run
one's
life
.
The
amount
of
laziness
,
moral
degeneracy
,
arrogance
,
and
general
buffoonery
I've
witnessed
among
the
older
set
has
forever
cured
me
of
the
idea
that
my
elders
,
’
prima
facie
,
are
a
source
of
wisdom
.
While
OK
Boomer
,
is
not
necessarily
a
productive
way
to
conduct
dialogue
,
there
are
other
important
issues
with
simply
dismissing
the
ideas
of
Boomers
because
of
the
way
they
conduct
themselves
on
the
Internet
.
Just
as
elders
are
not
prima
facie
a
source
of
wisdom
,
youth
isn’t
necessarily
a
fountain
of
low
time
preference
.
Young
people
have
moved
remarkably
to
the
Left
,
but
display
a
shockingly
poor
understanding
of
politics
.
A
Reason
Rupe
survey
from
five
years
ago
found
that
42
of
Millennials
find
socialism
preferable
to
capitalism
,
but
the
same
poll
also
found
that
only
16
of
Millennials
could
provide
a
coherent
definition
of
socialism
.
This
Vox
article
underscores
some
of
the
other
puzzling
inconsistencies
of
Millennial
ideology
from
this
survey
.
Young
people
are
also
notoriously
self
righteous
on
social
media
,
especially
with
regard
to
Boomers
.
One
need
only
to
browse
their
Facebook
or
Twitter
feed
for
a
few
minutes
before
seeing
someone
sharing
the
latest
NYTimes
opinion
piece
attacking
the
Trump
administration
for
not
doing
enough
on
climate
change
,
patting
themselves
on
the
back
for
their
contribution
to
the
struggle
,
and
then
accusing
older
people
of
ruining
the
planet
for
them
.
The
reality
is
somewhat
different
.
It
was
Boomers
who
helped
fight
for
many
of
those
things
that
millennials
hold
so
dear
.
From
taking
action
on
Civil
Rights
,
to
protesting
the
war
in
Vietnam
,
to
spurring
revolutions
in
science
and
engineering
,
Boomers
changed
nbsp
;
the
lives
of
millions
for
the
better
,
and
we’re
still
feeling
the
benefits
of
those
changes
today
.
In
fact
,
they
helped
create
the
wealthiest
country
in
the
.
They
gave
us
cellular
phones
,
the
internet
,
medicines
that
saved
countless
lives
,
and
so
much
more
.
Sure
,
like
I
said
,
they’re
not
perfect
.
But
neither
are
young
people
.
It’s
important
to
understand
this
is
not
an
indictment
of
the
youth
or
an
encomium
of
Boomers
.
It’s
a
reminder
of
how
important
intergenerational
dialogue
can
be
,
and
that
we
shouldn’t
close
ourselves
off
because
of
some
aggregate
differences
in
policy
preferences
because
,
if
anything
is
clear
,
neither
side
has
all
the
answers
.
It’s
November
,
Mercury
is
in
retrograde
and
I
for
one
have
mapped
out
the
remaining
weeks
of
the
semester
with
a
mild
but
steadily
intensifying
sense
of
dread
.
The
semester
is
flying
by
,
and
it’s
a
good
idea
to
check
in
with
the
Food
Points
Usage
Chart
.
If
the
food
point
balance
is
at
all
in
your
favor
,
it
is
time
for
one
thing
Nasher
Brunch
.

Did
Michael
Che
once
go
undercover
as
a
Liberal
White
Woman
Named
Gretchen
for
a
Saturday
Night
Live
bit
?
Yes
he
did
.
Was
going
to
brunch
an
essential
part
of
that
character
?
Indeed
it
was
.
I
know
my
brand
,
so
I
can
sheepishly
own
up
to
it
and
enjoy
a
smoked
salmon
omelet
at
the
same
time
.
The
Nasher
Café
is
arguably
the
highest
quality
restaurant
on
campus
.
The
menu
is
seasonal
,
the
ingredients
are
local
and
the
vibe
is
excellent
.
Before
I
jump
into
a
deep
analysis
,
let
me
lay
a
couple
things
on
the
table
.
First
,
I
should
be
honest
I
work
at
the
Nasher
.
I’m
a
Development
amp
;
Marketing
student
assistant
,
which
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
Nasher
Café
and
quite
a
lot
to
do
with
stuffing
envelopes
,
but
my
innate
bias
towards
the
institution
that
sustains
both
my
body
and
my
bank
account
will
undoubtedly
make
itself
clear
,
and
I
wanted
to
get
it
off
my
chest
.
Second
,
I
want
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
financial
responsibility
.
No
one’s
meal
plan
can
support
unrestricted
Nasher
outings
,
and
I
cannot
be
held
liable
for
any
first
years
blowing
through
their
food
points
because
they
read
this
and
threw
caution
to
the
wind
after
their
first
bite
of
the
Nasher’s
baked
cinnamon
French
toast
.
Easy
does
it
,
young
padawan
.
No
,
the
Nasher
cannot
and
should
not
be
a
daily
routine
.
It
should
be
a
grand
affair
,
reserved
for
birthdays
,
flunches
or
dates
I
mean
,
I
assume
.
I
definitely
have
not
imagined
how
perfect
it
would
be
to
share
a
cheese
plate
with
a
special
someone
on
an
open
terrace
surrounded
by
tall
pine
trees
swaying
gently
in
the
spring
breeze
.
It’s
never
really
crossed
my
mind
.
nbsp
;
Nasher
brunch
is
for
those
weeks
when
you
realize
you’re
twenty
food
points
ahead
of
the
suggested
amount
,
or
have
used
a
Marketplace
guest
swipe
on
an
upperclassman
and
it’s
their
turn
to
pay
up
,
or
just
want
to
treat
yourself
.
And
if
you’re
going
to
Nasher
brunch
,
you’re
This
is
not
a
time
to
hold
back
or
choose
between
appetizer
or
dessert
,
but
it
is
important
to
follow
a
gameplan
.
The
first
rule
and
the
most
important
by
far
make
a
reservation
.
nbsp
;
You
can
do
it
online
!
nbsp
;
You
don’t
even
have
to
talk
to
anyone
!
nbsp
;
But
you
gotta
have
a
res
.
Second
don’t
eat
breakfast
before
brunch
.
That’s
like
making
a
sandwich
an
hour
before
Thanksgiving
dinner
is
served
it
simply
isn’t
done
.
Now
we’re
going
to
walk
through
the
tantalizing
cornucopia
of
possibilities
that
is
the
Nasher
Café
brunch
menu
start
with
a
drink
.
If
you
aren’t
21
,
for
the
love
of
orange
farmers
,
wine
snobs
and
art
museums
everywhere
,
don’t
degrade
the
Nasher
by
trying
to
order
a
mimosa
with
your
fake
I
.
D
.
Their
lattes
and
hot
chocolates
come
in
mugs
the
size
of
soup
bowls
,
and
that
will
be
indulgent
enough
.
But
if
you
are
21
,
you
know
what
to
do
.
App
time
.
While
you’re
half
listening
to
your
brunchmates
exchange
lukewarm
takes
about
Tallman
Trask’s
retirement
,
smile
to
the
waiter
and
whisper
the
magic
words
The
chocolate
chip
cookies
are
some
of
the
best
on
campus
and
the
gelato
is
always
a
lovely
palate
cleanser
,
but
there’s
really
only
one
clear
choice
the
chocolate
lava
cake
.
A
unique
kind
of
primal
urge
takes
hold
when
you
cut
into
the
warm
cake
for
the
first
time
,
and
I
want
everyone
to
be
able
to
experience
that
rush
.
At
this
point
,
everyone
is
too
full
to
think
straight
and
we’re
all
ready
to
go
lay
in
bed
or
fight
for
a
table
in
Perkins
.
And
this
is
where
the
Nasher
gifts
us
with
a
final
,
unexpected
delight
if
you
pay
in
food
points
,
the
gratuity
is
automatically
applied
to
the
check
.
When
the
food
coma
is
setting
in
,
my
befuddled
,
English
major
mind
doesn’t
even
have
to
do
math
.
And
that
is
truly
a
beautiful
thing
.
The
walk
from
Edens
1C
to
Blue
Zone
takes
approximately
8
minutes
and
38
seconds
.
That
doesn’t
sound
too
bad
,
until
you
actually
calculate
the
inefficiency
that
Duke
Parking
amp
;
Transportation
has
managed
to
impressively
concoct
.
A
quick
look
on
their
website
reveals
that
we’ve
been
forced
to
move
our
cars
six
times
this
semester
out
of
just
eleven
weeks
of
classes
.
Doing
the
math
,
that
comes
out
to
103
.
6
minutes
which
I
have
spent
,
unwillingly
,
going
back
and
forth
from
my
dorm
to
the
parking
lot
and
that’s
not
even
including
the
time
wasted
on
searching
for
another
place
to
leave
my
car
.
If
I
could
get
back
these
stolen
minutes
,
I
might’ve
studied
more
and
scored
higher
on
my
last
Economics
exam
.
Maybe
I
would’ve
actually
gone
for
a
run
.
Or
finished
my
column
earlier
.
Okay
,
most
likely
,
I
would’ve
traded
them
in
for
another
episode
of
Peaky
Blinders
.
However
,
since
I’m
forced
to
make
the
trek
to
Blue
Zone
whenever
I
leave
campus
and
whenever
our
football
team
happens
plays
at
home
I’ve
been
left
with
no
choice
but
to
try
to
convince
myself
that
the
walk
is
a
pleasant
one
.
For
the
most
part
,
I’ve
managed
to
fool
myself
.
In
early
fall
,
the
trees
alongside
Wannamaker
Lane
start
to
grow
into
a
fiery
red
orange
and
flitter
their
leaves
across
the
road
.
A
quiet
breeze
scatters
them
around
.
I
try
to
step
on
as
many
as
possible
.
The
weather
is
ideal
enough
during
these
weeks
that
I
can’t
be
too
annoyed
.
Once
spring
rolls
around
,
the
cherry
blossoms
burst
into
light
pink
.
My
mood
lifts
with
the
flowers
.
With
birds
performing
around
me
and
the
sun
shining
brightly
,
I
can
almost
even
forgive
Duke
Parking
for
cheating
us
.
But
during
the
winter
months
in
between
,
all
I
can
feel
is
bitterness
.
There’s
nothing
redeeming
about
the
walk
between
campus
and
parking
then
it’s
miserable
,
dark
,
and
lifeless
.
The
trees
are
stripped
bare
and
the
sun
disappears
in
the
late
afternoon
.
As
I’m
driving
back
,
the
last
thing
I
want
to
do
is
carry
groceries
in
the
freezing
weather
.
More
often
than
not
,
I
contemplate
whether
it’s
worth
risking
the
40
dollar
ticket
to
park
closer
elsewhere
.
Although
I
can
find
joy
in
walking
during
the
rest
of
the
year
,
the
task
is
impossible
when
my
feet
are
numb
.
With
the
wind
snapping
at
my
heels
as
I
rush
across
Wannamaker
Drive
,
there’s
only
one
thought
racing
through
my
mind
why
is
it
so
damn
cold
?
With
the
frosty
weather
creeping
closer
to
us
,
I’d
much
prefer
winter
to
disappear
altogether
.
So
rather
than
spending
any
time
longer
outside
than
necessary
,
I’d
suggest
you
do
the
following
too
The
Silent
Vigil
of
1968
and
the
Allen
Building
Takeover
of
1969
have
achieved
rightfully
so
an
almost
canonical
status
in
our
institutional
memory
of
Duke
student
activism
during
the
late
1960s
and
1970s
.
Duke
students
demonstrated
for
a
1
.
60
minimum
wage
and
collective
bargaining
rights
for
non
academic
workers
the
majority
of
whom
were
Black
the
creation
of
an
African
American
Studies
department
and
increased
resources
for
Black
students
,
among
other
demands
for
greater
racial
,
economic
and
social
justice
at
Duke
and
in
Durham
.
Similar
demonstrations
and
protests
were
occurring
across
the
country
and
all
over
college
campuses
,
challenging
the
foundations
of
university
institutions
and
American
society
itself
.
However
,
when
talking
about
the
long
sixties
,
it’s
impossible
to
ignore
the
significance
of
anti
Vietnam
War
protests
as
well
as
the
connections
drawn
between
it
and
other
contemporary
movements
.
The
Student
Nonviolent
Coordinating
Committee
condemned
the
Vietnam
War
in
1966
,
arguing
that
the
United
States
,
which
had
consistently
failed
to
guarantee
freedom
for
Black
Americans
,
was
hypocritical
in
feigning
concern
for
the
freedom
and
democracy
of
Vietnamese
people
.
Working
class
communities
opposed
the
war
on
the
basis
that
it
was
another
rich
man’s
war
,
poor
man’s
fight
,
which
disproportionately
drafted
the
poor
to
be
cannon
fodder
,
and
that
the
military
industrial
complex
should
be
dismantled
in
favor
of
building
social
programs
instead
.
At
Duke
,
students
linked
the
struggle
against
the
oppression
of
Black
people
and
exploitation
of
workers
through
actions
like
the
Silent
Vigil
and
Allen
Building
Takeover
.
But
did
they
make
similar
connections
with
the
Vietnam
War
,
and
if
so
,
what
is
Duke’s
history
of
anti
war
activism
?
What
stories
do
we
tell
about
student
activism
and
organizing
at
Duke
?
What
stories
do
we
forget
?
This
column
is
an
attempt
to
breathe
life
back
into
the
history
of
anti
war
activism
at
Duke
.
The
Duke
Chronicle’s
archives
from
1968
1974
offer
a
glimpse
into
what
was
no
doubt
a
contentious
,
impassioned
campus
climate
regarding
the
Vietnam
War
.
The
Chronicle
reported
on
student
demonstrations
and
organization
statements
.
Numerous
editorials
launched
scathing
criticisms
of
the
war
and
Duke’s
connections
to
the
military
industrial
complex
namely
ROTC
,
the
AROD
Army
Research
Office
Durham
,
and
military
funded
university
research
.
On
January
30
,
1969
,
the
Chronicle’s
editorial
board
argued
that
by
its
very
inaction
,
our
University
has
become
an
insensitive
agent
of
imperialism
,
racism
,
and
poverty
.
In
strong
terms
,
the
board
claimed
that
for
university
credit
,
students
are
trained
to
kill
and
are
indoctrinated
with
blind
patriotism
in
the
ROTC
.
They
also
drew
attention
to
the
presence
of
the
Army
Research
Office
in
the
campus
computer
center
and
the
fact
that
an
overly
large
proportion
of
the
university’s
revenue
went
towards
defense
research
.
In
April
1969
,
the
Student
Liberation
Front
SLF
released
its
position
paper
on
the
Vietnam
War
.
The
SLF
believed
that
through
its
participation
in
ROTC
programs
and
acceptance
of
Department
of
Defense
DOD
funding
,
which
supported
14
of
all
of
Duke’s
restricted
access
research
,
Duke
University
and
universities
in
general
became
an
apologist
for
an
accomplice
to
the
imperialist
policies
of
the
military
establishment
.
The
Duke
chapter
of
Students
for
a
Democratic
Society
released
a
similar
statement
the
following
year
,
condemning
the
US
military
and
calling
for
the
removal
of
ROTC
programs
from
Duke
.
In
May
of
1969
,
300
students
from
the
SLF
also
staged
a
demonstration
at
Duke’s
annual
ROTC
parade
in
the
Wallace
Wade
Stadium
,
carrying
signs
of
Bring
the
Troops
Home
Now
and
End
Militarism
.
Demanding
the
removal
of
ROTC
from
campus
by
October
1
,
1969
,
they
were
met
with
jeers
and
death
threats
from
the
crowd
in
the
stadium
.
On
May
4
,
1970
,
four
students
at
Kent
State
University
were
shot
and
killed
and
nine
more
were
injured
protesting
the
bombing
of
Cambodia
and
the
escalation
of
the
Vietnam
War
,
sparking
student
strikes
and
protests
across
the
country
.
After
1
,
000
people
gathered
in
Page
Auditorium
that
night
to
discuss
responses
to
the
escalation
of
the
war
,
200
students
presented
a
list
of
demands
the
next
day
to
President
Sanford
calling
for
an
end
to
all
American
involvement
in
Indochina
,
the
end
of
all
military
influence
on
campus
,
including
the
Army
Research
Office
Durham
and
ROTC
,
and
an
end
to
the
repression
of
all
workers
,
especially
the
super
repression’
of
blacks
and
women
at
Duke
.
Through
these
demands
,
Duke
students
explicitly
linked
the
oppression
Black
people
,
workers
,
and
women
at
Duke
with
the
war
in
Vietnam
.
Throughout
that
day
,
nearly
a
thousand
Duke
students
participated
in
anti
war
actions
such
as
sit
ins
,
building
takeovers
,
and
flyering
downtown
Durham
.
500
students
attended
a
rally
after
the
Associated
Students
of
Duke
University
ASDU
,
a
predecessor
to
Duke
Student
Government
,
called
for
a
24
hour
vigil
and
peace
fast
.
Reportedly
,
60
of
students
participated
in
a
boycott
of
classes
to
support
non
academic
workers
and
their
right
to
unionize
.
About
400
students
barricaded
Duke
University
Road
,
grinding
traffic
to
a
halt
for
nearly
9
hours
to
protest
the
war
.
Actions
against
the
war
continued
at
Duke
until
at
least
1975
,
with
four
students
staging
a
die
in
at
the
Navy
ROTC
parade
in
1971
and
renewed
demonstrations
against
the
Sanford
School’s
DOD
funding
in
1975
.
Despite
a
restriction
placed
in
1969
on
the
number
of
military
courses
that
could
count
towards
graduation
,
an
Academic
Council
subcommittee
on
the
ROTC
program
found
it
legitimate
.
President
Sanford
,
responding
to
student
demands
,
agreed
to
form
another
University
committee
investigating
ROTC
and
promised
to
put
a
non
academic
workers
union
election
on
the
May
1970
Board
of
Trustees
calendar
.
In
1971
,
Duke
ended
its
basic
agreement
contract
with
AROD
although
the
office
did
not
move
off
campus
where
it
remains
to
this
day
until
1975
.

It
is
not
the
place
of
this
column
to
determine
whether
or
not
Duke’s
anti
Vietnam
War
movement
was
a
success
or
failure
.
The
work
of
history
is
to
uncover
a
usable
past
that
can
illuminate
possibilities
for
the
present
and
future
world
.
For
Duke
students
today
who
struggle
against
what
Reverend
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
.
called
the
three
evils
of
society
racism
,
poverty
,
and
militarism
the
anti
war
movement
at
Duke
in
the
late
1960s
and
early
1970s
is
proof
that
fellow
Duke
students
dared
to
imagine
a
different
society
.
As
we
confront
the
endless
wars
of
our
time
,
may
we
take
both
comfort
and
strength
in
the
tradition
we
inherit
from
those
who
came
before
us
.
The
Chronicle
publishes
a
lot
of
dumb
stuff
.
Like
mostly
dumb
stuff
.
Like
case
in
point
,
what
you’re
reading
right
now
.
Like
for
every
article
of
substance
there’s
like
three
about
Joey
Baker
slapping
the
floor
or
something
dumb
like
that
.
It
has
been
brought
to
my
attention
recently
that
I
spend
a
lot
of
time
criticizing
others’
work
while
offering
little
in
the
way
of
solutions
to
fix
the
things
I
have
problems
with
.
So
let’s
get
into
it
.
Let’s
try
and
fix
this
thing
.
I
have
to
first
acknowledge
that
my
desire
to
provide
practical
solutions
was
inspired
in
large
part
by
Reiss
Becker’s
recent
article
How
to
improve
DSG
Duke's
tin
pot
democracy
.
Reiss
could
have
just
listed
the
issues
he
had
with
DSG
and
left
it
at
that
.
But
he
didn’t
.
Instead
he
proposed
a
system
straight
out
of
a
YA
dystopian
novel
where
the
DSG
senate
is
comprised
of
representatives
of
different
Duke
social
factions
,
as
opposed
to
the
current
system
where
the
DSG
senate
is
comprised
of
tools
.
Is
Reiss
Becker’s
solution
f
ing
crazy
?
You
bet
.
Does
anyone
even
care
?
I
just
want
Liv
McKinney
to
stop
sending
me
emails
.
But
at
least
he’s
putting
an
original
idea
out
there
,
and
I
commend
him
for
it
.
My
solution
to
fix
The
Chronicle
is
to
steal
the
model
of
the
only
publication
,
in
my
opinion
,
doing
it
right
in
today’s
news
climate
.
The
only
publication
which
I
read
every
morning
and
every
night
without
fail
.
The
only
publication
giving
the
people
what
they
want
.
The
Duke
Chronicle
should
be
more
like
The
Daily
Mail
.
For
those
unfamiliar
with
The
Daily
Mail
,
1
how
,
2
look
it
up
.
There
are
lots
of
ways
to
consume
The
Daily
Mail
but
my
medium
of
choice
is
their
Snap
story
,
updated
twice
a
day
,
every
day
.
The
Daily
Mail
has
their
model
down
to
an
exact
science
.
They
publish
articles
which
fall
under
one
of
three
categories
sex
,
violence
and
humiliation
.
Their
best
work
often
falls
at
the
intersection
of
two
or
even
better
,
all
three
.
The
Daily
Mail
does
not
concern
itself
with
cohesiveness
.
An
article
about
Emily
Ratajkowski
sitting
on
a
beach
is
often
directly
followed
by
an
article
about
a
gruesome
crime
that
happened
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
West
Virginia
.
Part
of
the
fun
of
scrolling
through
The
Daily
Mail
Snap
story
is
that
you
never
know
what’s
gonna
come
next
.
The
Daily
Mail
also
does
not
concern
itself
with
facts
or
the
truth
.
If
The
New
York
Times
were
covering
Justin
Beiber
crying
in
a
park
,
they
might
write
some
cop
out
statement
like
we
can’t
say
for
certain
at
this
point
in
time
why
Beiber
was
crying
.
But
The
Daily
Mail
doesn’t
pussyfoot
around
like
that
.
Their
headline
would
look
something
like
this
,
in
large
bolded
lettering
and
often
accompanied
by
a
whimsical
background
music
The
people
don’t
want
to
be
informed
,
they
want
to
be
entertained
.
Here
,
look
.
I’m
gonna
take
some
existing
,
boring
Chronicle
headlines
and
add
some
Daily
Mail
flair
.
For
example
Nugget
may
be
a
rockstar
,
’
but
don’t
forget
Keith
.
A
better
headline
Keith

buying
peanut
butter
,
what’s
he
using
it
for
?

The

could
use
a
complete
aesthetic
overhaul
,
and
again
in
this
regard
should
take
a
page
out
of
The
Daily
Mail’s
book
.
No
more
clean
and
simple
.
The
Chronicle
should
be
loud
and
all
over
the
f
g
place
.
I’m
talking
lots
of
color
,
big
text
,
heavily
photoshopped

,
I
understand
that
now
more
than

we
need
quality
investigative
reporting
;
that
a
generation
is
being
brainwashed
by
Mark
Zuckerberg
and
his
less
than
factual
Facebook
articles
.
So
yeah
,
The
Chronicle
should
probably
strive
to
tell
the
truth
for
things
that
actually
matter
.
But
an
article
about
f
g
Keith
?
Who
needs
that
to
begin
with
,
you’re
gonna
make
it
mind
numbingly
dull
?
Maybe
don’t
lie
,
that
was
probably
bad
advice
,
I’ll
give
you
that
,
but
make
that
sh
t
more
interesting
or
don’t
write
it
.
The
Chronicle
actually
has
some
really
great
stuff
,
important
stuff
it
just
gets
buried
by
a
sea
of
useless
information
.
So
I
guess
what
I’m
saying
is
,
Leah
and
Mihir
,
please
stop
letting
me
write
this
column
.
I
haven’t
been
home
for
Thanksgiving
in
four
years
.
This
isn’t
a
sob
story
I
am
privileged
to
have
a
loving
family
that
would
welcome
me
home
at
any
time
,
and
I
don’t
take
that
for
granted
.
Vermont
is
just
really
far
from
North
Carolina
.
That
said
,
anyone
who
has
been
absent
from
home
on
a
holiday
like
Thanksgiving
can
corroborate
my
experience
that
no
matter
how
prepared
and
well
adjusted
I
think
I
am
,
I
can’t
restrain
the
homesickness
that
creeps
into
the
day
.
I
want
my
grandma’s
apple
pie
,
with
fruit
and
spices
bursting
out
of
a
perfect
pie
crust
.
I
want
my
mom’s
sweet
potato
casserole
,
recreated
from
her
mom’s
old
recipe
book
.
I
want
the
clumsy
turkey
placemarkers
my
sisters
and
I
made
when
we
were
little
.
I
want
to
be
Despite
the
hopes
buried
deep
inside
,
if
asked
,
I
never
would
have
predicted
that
two
weeks
later
,
I
would
open
an
email
from
Duke
Undergraduate
Admissions
that
began
,
Congratulations
!
Maybe
it’s
this
gloomy
weather
or
my
Snapchat
memories
or
listening
to
Taylor
Swift’s
on
repeat
,
but
I
have
been
caught
up
in
remembering
my
previous
Duke
Thanksgivings
.
They
have
always
just
felt
like
a
comma
,
a
brief
pause
in
the
long
stretch
of
the
fall
semester
that
strikes
just
before
the
end
.
The
Thanksgiving
story
is
complicated
and
problematic
.
It
is
deeply
rooted
in
colonialism
and
racism
,
and
has
grown
intertwined
with
and
sustained
by
the
imperialist
values
of
white
,
Christian
America
.
But
at
its
best
,
Thanksgiving
is
meant
to
be
about
giving
thanks
for
what
we
have
and
welcoming
those
who
need
a
home
or
a
meal
.
On
a
stuffy
Amtrak
to
my
aunt’s
house
in
Maryland
in
2016
,
I
remember
wondering
what
I
would
say
I
was
thankful
for
when
we
went
around
the
table
before
dinner
.
How
could
we
celebrate
this
holiday
,
meant
to
be
the
epitome
of
inclusion
and
gratitude
,
when
we
had
just
elected
someone
who
ran
a
campaign
on
promises
of
walls
and
travel
bans
?
The
next
year
,
Thanksgiving
was
filled
with
writing
papers
,
studying
for
tests
and
making
plans
that
felt
random
and
surprising
,
even
then
.
Religious
tensions
between
Protestantism
and
Catholicism
as
seen
in
Bram
Stoker’s
This
Thanksgiving
,
I
am
trying
not
to
be
afraid
.
I
am
trying
to
take
comfort
in
the
knowledge
that
all
the
unknowns
worked
out
last
time
.
I
am
trying
to
give
thanks
for
the
tangible
blessings
of
my
life
warm
hugs
,
starry
nights
,
good
food
.
All
I
know
is
gratitude
,
for
the
place
and
people
who
have
given
me
so
much
.
A
couple
days
ago
,
I
decided
to
grab
a
cup
of
coffee
from
Vondy
.
A
very
simple
task
,
to
be
sure
.
As
I
approached
the
cashier
,
however
,
my
eyes
encountered
a
grotesque
,
yet
captivating
sight
.
Directly
next
to
the
cashier
was
a
pile
nay
,
a
mound
of
oversized
pastries
.
Scones
,
cakes
,
the
most
buttered
and
sugared
breads
I’d
seen
in
ages
.
My
shock
at
such
an
aggressive
display
of
sugar
took
a
long
time
to
wane
.
Even
as
I
sipped
my
coffee
,
the
image
of
the
stacked
carbohydrates
continued
to
haunt
me
.
For
those
who
don’t
have
as
cultivated
an
aversion
to
sugar
as
I
do
,
this
sight
may
not
have
meant
anything
.
To
be
clear
,
I
have
nothing
against
people
who
buy
large
scones
with
their
afternoon
coffee
.
What
I
do
have
a
problem
with
is
the
overabundance
of
sugar
across
campus
.
After
this
encounter
that
so
disturbed
my
sensibilities
,
I
was
on
the
watch
for
refined
sugar
around
Duke’s
campus
.
The
first
place
of
interest
was
,
rather
obviously
,
Marketplace
.
What
was
Duke’s
food
policy
in
a
buffet
style
situation
?
To
my
surprise
and
disappointment
,
sugar
is
ubiquitous
in
Marketplace
.
For
breakfast
,
there
are
regular
pastries
like
muffins
or
croissants
,
sugary
cereals
,
chocolate
milk
40g
of
sugar
per
glass
,
and
fruit
juices
42
49g
of
sugar
per
glass
.
Orange
juice
is
10g
per
glass
;
pancakes
and
french
toast
8g
sugar
with
syrup
37
g
of
sugar
per
ladle
or
fruit
compote
17
g
of
sugar
per
ladle
for
strawberry
are
common
breakfast
items
,
too
.
Marketplace
does
offer
healthy
options
alongside
the
sugar
;
there
are
bins
full
of
fruit
.
Simple
vegetarian
and
vegan
options
are
always
available
.
Plain
vegetables
and
fruits
are
regularly
served
.
Simultaneously
,
however
,
piles
of
dessert
cakes
,
ice
cream
,
and
more
are
laid
out
in
an
infinite
stream
.
But
Marketplace
is
not
the
only
offender
.
In
the
Brodhead
Center
,
look
to
the
sweets
offered
at
the
checkout
section
of
an
eatery
.
Watch
out
for
Il
Forno’s
Chocolate
Chunk
cookie
with
34g
of
sugar
per
serving
.
There
are
smoothies
from
the
Loop
a
strawberry
shake
has
84
g
of
sugar
.
Even
Red
Mango
drinks
are
filled
with
sugar
a
16oz
Strawberry
Energizer
has
42g
of
sugar
.
The
stockade
of
fructose
doesn’t
end
outside
the
food
hall
it
is
bolstered
by
the
regular
vending
machines
throughout
Duke’s
campus
.
These
are
filled
with
snacks
most
people
know
to
be
unhealthy
.
Even
snacks
people
might
assume
to
be
healthy
,
like
Clif
Bars
,
have
about
16g
of
included
sugars
.
I
hope
I’m
not
sounding
too
much
like
a
nagging
parent
.
The
truth
is
,
however
,
we
are
inundated
by
sugar
.
Some
of
you
may
not
care
about
this
state
of
affairs
.
Sure
,
sugar
is
supposedly
bad
for
us
,
but
what
does
it
really
do
?
The
specific
problem
at
hand
is
the
regular
consumption
of
large
amounts
of
added
sugars
without
fiber
.
These
added
sugars
almost
always
contain
fructose
,
a
compound
digested
in
the
liver
.
Just
as
too
much
alcohol
damages
the
liver
,
a
similar
process
unfolds
with
overconsumption
of
added
sugars
.
Humans
were
not
meant
to
consume
so
much
fructose
;
in
the
wild
,
humans
mostly
ate
sugar
in
the
form
of
fruit
which
has
fiber
to
slow
digestion
.
Are
we
over
consuming
at
Duke
?
Sugar
is
not
required
to
survive
,
and
so
no
minimum
amount
of
sugar
is
prescribed
;
rather
,
sugar
is
described
in
regards
to
its
recommended
daily
intake
.
For
adult
females
,
this
is
25
g
of
added
sugar
a
day
;
for
males
it
is
38
g
.
This
means
a
female
first
year
who
gets
a
glass
of
juice
for
breakfast
has
already
exceeded
her
daily
maximum
by
almost
17
g
of
sugar
.
If
she
decides
to
eat
a
pancake
too
,
she
will
have
eaten
double
her
recommended
daily
amount
of
sugar
in
a
single
meal
.

At
the
heart
of
the
problem
is
that
most
students
are
unaware
of
the
amount
of
sugar
we
consume
.
The
only
reason
I
found
the
sugar
content
in
most
of
the
foods
listed
here
is
because
Duke
publishes
nutrition
information
on
their
dining
website
.
My
intuition
is
that
an
overwhelming
majority
of
students
have
no
idea
about
the
sugar
content
of
the
food
they
consume
daily
.
How
can
you
control
something
you
aren’t
aware
of
?
Another
major
issue
at
hand
is
the
ease
and
abundance
with
which
sugar
is
available
.
Research
has
shown
that
sugar
leads
to
cravings
,
chemical
changes
in
the
brain’s
reward
system
and
can
lead
to
withdrawal
symptoms
if
denied
.
How
much
willpower
can
each
student
be
expected
to
have
?
In
dealing
with
multiple
tiers
of
stress
academic
,
social
,
personal
having
to
realign
one’s
eating
habits
is
another
added
task
and
a
difficult
one
at
that
.
It’s
much
too
easy
for
the
stressed
organic
chemistry
student
to
grab
a
glass
of
chocolate
milk
to
feel
better
about
an
upcoming
midterm
;
our
natural
tendency
is
to
search
for
these
comfort
foods
.
When
they
are
spread
out
for
the
taking
,
how
often
will
we
be
able
to
resist
?
Let
me
make
a
few
things
clear
.
I’m
not
here
to
judge
the
morality
of
eating
added
sugars
.
We
all
eat
sugary
foods
and
drinks
occasionally
;
it's
entirely
our
choice
to
eat
what
we
want
.
We
choose
how
to
treat
our
own
bodies
.
The
point
I
want
to
make
,
however
,
is
that
Duke
has
a
responsibility
to
its
student
body
to
be
cognizant
of
the
medical
issues
underlying
sugar
consumption
and
the
psychological
basis
upon
which
people
become
hooked
to
it
.
Sugary
options
should
be
available
if
a
student
wishes
to
choose
to
have
dessert
.
But
should
sugar
be
so
easily
available
at
all
meals
?
Should
it
be
sold
without
any
labels
?
Last
month
,
a
group
of
concerned
faculty
and
leadership
submitted
a
letter
to
the
Chronicle
urging
for
a
ban
of
vapes
and
e
cigarettes
on
campus
.
They
were
concerned
with
the
highly
addictive
and
life
threatening
effects
of
vaping
and
made
their
case
in
a
succinct
letter
.
I’m
not
here
to
debate
this
policy
in
specific
;
I
don’t
know
enough
about
vaping
to
discuss
it
.
What
did
interest
me
,
however
,
was
the
interest
medical
and
health
sciences
faculty
took
in
promoting
student
health
in
this
scenario
.
It
is
comforting
to
know
that
Duke
has
access
to
leading
experts
in
the
medical
field
when
they
design
health
policy
for
undergraduates
.
Given
this
,
however
,
I
feel
Duke
has
the
resources
and
information
available
to
establish
a
healthier
food
culture
on
campus
.
Why
should
the
danger
of
vaping
be
weighted
above
that
of
sugar
overconsumption
?
In
many
ways
,
more
people
are
affected
by
sugar
overconsumption
.
Almost
everyone
eats
sugar
only
about
21
of
college
students
vape
.
Beyond
that
,
Duke
has
control
and
therefore
,
responsibility
over
the
sugar
it
makes
available
to
students
;
imagine
if
Duke
were
selling
vapes
and
then
ignored
the
health
issues
surrounding
this
decision
.
For
students
,
I
urge
you
to
read
more
on
the
effects
of
sugar
consumption
.
There
are
plenty
of
video
resources
that
do
a
great
job
of
breaking
down
the
chemical
effects
of
sugar
.
Not
only
that
,
videos
regarding
how
sugar
is
abused
by
food
companies
can
be
useful
tools
in
combating
personal
sugar
overconsumption
.
At
the
very
least
,
I
hope
that
you
are
a
little
more
careful
when
you
go
to
get
that
healthy
fruit
juice
in
Marketplace
.
My
junior
fall
,
I
spent
many
weekend
nights
with
my
roommate
working
on
internship
applications
.
In
our
double
facing
main
quad
,
we'd
sit
at
our
desks
or
curled
up
in
bed
,
typing
away
at
our
computers
,
editing
cover
letters
and
resumes
,
filling
out
applications
,
doing
coding
challenges
,
recording
video
interviews
,
emailing
recruiters
,
preparing
for
interviews
,
updating
our
internship
spreadsheets
all
the
things
that
made
up
recruitment
.
There
were
a
lot
of
benefits
to
going
through
this
process
with
a
friend
.
We'd
share
resources
,
ask
,
does
this
sound
impressive
?
about
specific
language
on
our
resumes
,
read
email
drafts
aloud
to
each
other
,
question
how
to
navigate
the
foreign
network
of
LinkedIn
,
give
each
other
pep
talks
,
trying
to
bring
some
human
emotion
into
what
otherwise
felt
like
a
cold
and
uncaring
process
.
But
what’s
stuck
with
me
the
most
is
the
time
we
spent
on
conversations
.
I'm
not
sure
when
we
started
talking
about
the
confidence
of
a
mediocre
white
male
,
but
we
weren't
the
first
to
use
the
phrase
.
The
internet
seems
to
agree
that
it
first
showed
up
in
a
tweet
by
the
Canadian
writer
Sarah
Hagi
back
in
2015
.
Etsy
has
a
whole
slew
of
mugs
,
shirts
,
tote
bags
,
buttons
,
cross
stich
patterns
,
and
stickers
that
say
Carry
yourself
with
the
confidence
of
a
mediocre
white
man
.
The
confidence
gap
is
well
documented
,
with
terms
like
imposter
syndrome
and
the
need
to
lean
in
.
One
study
found
that
men
would
apply
to
a
job
if
they
felt
like
they
met
50
of
the
listed
qualifications
,
while
women
wouldn't
apply
unless
they
met
90
of
the
qualifications
.
Professionally
,
women
choose
to
go
into
less
competitive
fields
.
Men
consistently
overestimate
their
abilities
relative
to
women
.
Part
of
me
used
to
and
still
does
live
in
awe
of
that
confidence
.
I
wonder
what
it’s
like
to
move
through
spaces
without
questioning
your
assumptions
,
without
having
to
wonder
whether
your
voice
is
interesting
or
relevant
.
Sometimes
I
want
to
know
what
it’s
like
to
be
less
qualified
and
more
confident
.
I
worry
about
how
these
kinds
of
day
to
day
interactions
will
bleed
into
my
post
grad
life
,
both
in
my
personal
interactions
and
in
the
professional
world
.
At
the
same
time
,
every
time
I
hear
an
extra
voice
because
I
decided
to
keep
my
mouth
shut
,
every
difficult
experience
I
can
speak
to
and
give
advice
on
because
I've
experienced
some
variety
of
it
myself
,
it
feels
worth
it
to
not
subscribe
to
those
norms
of
confidence
.
Because
of
course
,
confidence
is
the
product
of
so
many
other
societal
factors
.
Every
seminar
class
where
I
didn't
speak
up
and
didn’t
feel
like
I
needed
to
be
heard
,
every
networking
opportunity
I
skipped
or
botched
,
every
time
someone's
made
me
question
whether
I
belonged
in
a
space
,
every
time
I
got
probably
unconsciously
interrupted
,
every
time
I
felt
like
I
wasn't
being
taken
seriously
,
every
email
where
I
go
back
and
recalibrate
the
number
of
exclamation
points
to
convey
the
right
balance
between
seriousness
and
friendliness
,
every
weird
glance
I've
gotten
when
I
take
up
too
much
space
,
whatever
makes
me
feel
like
I
have
to
make
my
points
concise
and
be
insightful
witty
and
thoughtful
all
in
one
breath
.
Sometimes
I’m
pretty
sure
it
wasn’t
sure
if
it
was
all
just
in
my
head
.
And
after
all
,
this
is
Duke
,
and
we
all
got
here
in
part
by
playing
the
system
remarkably
well
.
Perhaps
it's
not
productive
to
spend
so
much
time
dwelling
on
confidence
,
or
lack
thereof
.
All
the
effort
put
towards
having
confidence
took
away
from
answering
very
real
questions
,
like
How
do
I
balance
the
very
real
need
to
have
summer
plans
with
Had
pre
professionalism
seeped
so
far
into
my
life
that
my
roommate
couldn’t
just
be
my
friend
on
a
Friday
night
rather
than
my
informal
career
coach
?
Sometimes
,
on
those
weekend
nights
,
when
the
pep
talks
were
just
too
many
words
,
when
the
concern
was
there
but
the
emotional
energy
wasn't
,
I
probably
spat
out
the
nbsp
;
words
MEDIOCRE
WHITE
MALE
at
her
,
as
a
shorter
version
of
But
of
course
,
that's
much
easier
said
than
done
.
Juju
,
the
Asian
tapas
restaurant
off
Ninth
Street
,
sucks
.
I
hate
its
overly
pretentious
atmosphere
,
its
ability
to
convince
Duke
students
to
shell
over
13
for
fried
rice
,
and
the
subtle
hint
of
bigotry
and
inauthenticity
that
permeates
the
whole
operation
.
For
this
generation
of
Asians
and
Asian
Americans
it’s
easy
to
see
something
like
Juju
and
then
feel
annoyed
,
mark
it
off
as
just
another
instance
of
cultural
appropriation
,
and
then
move
on
in
our
never
ending
search
for
more
authentic
cultural
engagements
.
However
,
it’s
substantially
harder
to
grapple
with
the
question
of
whether
society’s
infatuation
with
Asian
fusion
restaurants
,
calligraphy
tattoos
,
traditional
Asian
attire
,
and
Crazy
Rich
Asians
still
improves
our
material
conditions
and
social
standing
.
I
contend
that
oftentimes
our
criticisms
of
cultural
appropriation
begin
from
both
a
privileged
position
and
internal
insecurity
of
our
own
identity
,
particularly
for
Asian
Americans
like
me
.
The
common
response
to
this
question
about
cultural
appropriation
is
straightforward
there
is
nothing
inherently
wrong
in
paying
homage
to
a
culture
one
admires
,
but
authentic
engagement
requires
respectful
listening
and
truly
attempting
to
understand
the
history
and
experiences
of
another
;
cultural
appropriation
lacks
these
features
.
However
,
this
analysis
fails
to
respond
to
the
question
I’m
posing
.
I
grew
up
bullied
and
embarrassed
about
bringing
my
mom’s
cooking
to
school
and
attending
Chinese
school
on
Sundays
.
Those
same
bullies
now
listen
to
88rising
and
say
that
their
favorite
food
is
sushi
.
My
parents
traded
stability
and
comfort
in
the
hope
that
my
brother
and
I
could
succeed
and
were
met
in
America
with
hostility
and
disrespect
.
Now
our
racist
neighbors
ask
my
parents
about
dim
sum
recommendations
and
pick
their
brains
about
traveling
to
Asia
.
Their
engagements
with
Asians
are
indeed
misled
and
inauthentic
,
but
so
what
?
Yes
,
I
wish
their
appreciation
of
my
culture
was
legitimate
.
But
I
also
don’t
believe
that
we
can
possibly
expect
that
any
time
soon
.
I’m
willing
to
let
authenticity
take
a
backseat
as
bad
as
that
sounds
when
my
entire
existence
has
been
predicated
on
finding
a
survival
strategy
to
exist
in
this
world
;
for
the
first
time
in
our
lives
,
we’ve
found
ourselves
at
the
focal
point
of
Western
society’s
attention
in
positive
ways
.
While
I’m
aware
that
the
West’s
underlying
assumptions
about
Asians
have
hardly
changed
,
this
newest
fad
certainly
makes
it
easier
to
live
.
It’s
impossible
to
simply
ignore
our
material
conditions
.
Even
if
these
initial
engagements
appropriate
or
rely
upon
cultural
falsehoods
,
they
oftentimes
beget
more
authentic
experiences
later
on
and
positively
alter
preconceptions
about
a
particular
group
.
My
argument
is
not
that
we
should
sweep
Asian
American
oppression
under
the
rug
in
an
attempt
to
seem
more
friendly
to
the
West
but
to
think
more
critically
about
instances
of
cultural
appropriation
and
whether
they
may
be
natural
consequences
of
cultural
pluralism
or
even
the
few
surviving
remnants
of
Asian
culture
in
Western
public
life
.
False
allegations
of
cultural
appropriation
often
do
more
harm
to
the
culture
than
we
think
;
they
obfuscate
larger
,
more
legitimate
forms
of
Asian
American
violence
and
reduce
a
complicated
history
of
fetishization
and
stereotyping
into
a
simple
yet
unpalatable
phrase
.
Moreover
,
misapplications
of
the
term
may
dissuade
well
intentioned
individuals
from
even
interact
with
the
culture
in
the
first
place
.
The
notion
of
authenticity
itself
is
a
matter
of
degree
,
particularly
because
culture
and
tradition
are
mutable
and
historically
contingent
phenomena
.
The
most
troubling
observation
here
is
that
the
people
who
are
most
offended
by
instances
of
cultural
appropriation
are
often
those
who
are
furthest
from
the
culture
itself
.
Younger
generations
,
particularly
the
children
of
immigrants
,
tend
to
be
more
passionate
about
acts
of
appropriation
because
of
internal
insecurity
about
their
own
identities
and
because
they
too
are
often
in
the
process
of
engaging
with
and
learning
more
about
their
backgrounds
.

Older
generations
are
certainly
more
jaded
,
but
I
think
that
they
also
recognize
the
importance
of
survival
in
the
West
through
means
of
adaptation
and
modification
;
America
was
not
a
friendly
place
to
them
and
as
artifacts
of
the
authentic
culture
itself
,
they
find
the
dissemination
of
Asian
fashion
,
trends
,
and
cuisine
to
the
West
particularly
appealing
,
or
at
worst
neutral
.
These
generational
differences
suggest
that
it
may
even
be
problematic
and
neo
imperialist
for
younger
Asian
Americans
to
impose
Western
social
standards
upon
actual
immigrants
and
dictate
what
they
must
conceptualize
about
their
own
identities
.
I
think
it’s
also
important
to
draw
a
distinction
between
cultural
appropriation
for
Asians
and
other
identity
groups
for
a
variety
of
reasons
.
Not
only
are
there
relevant
historical
and
contextual
specificities
to
consider
,
but
appropriation
also
occurs
in
significantly
different
ways
that
in
turn
have
tremendous
consequences
on
scale
and
magnitude
.
Generalizing
my
analysis
to
all
other
identity
groups
is
both
imprecise
and
problematic
.
Please
don’t
reduce
my
argument
into
a
monolithic
bashing
of
cultural
appropriation
as
a
whole
.
Colorblind
cultural
exchange
is
impossible
;
great
disparities
in
power
dynamics
imply
that
cultural
exchanges
occur
in
unethical
,
harmful
,
and
neo
colonial
ways
.
However
,
while
it
may
be
hard
to
provide
a
bright
line
,
I
do
believe
that
there
are
certain
unavoidable
instances
of
cultural
exchange
that
nevertheless
precipitate
into
more
genuine
interactions
while
simultaneously
improving
our
day
to
day
material
conditions
.
Whenever
I
told
adults
that
I
was
a
a
math
major
who
b
wasn't
sure
what
I
wanted
to
do
after
graduation
,
I
would
always
hear
something
along
the
lines
of
,
don't
worry
,
you
can
do
anything
with
math
.
Often
,
the
phrase
transferable
skills
would
come
up
.
Over
the
past
three
years
,
I've
heard
a
lot
about
these
transferable
skills
.
Typically
,
they
were
some
mix
of
technical
,
reading
and
writing
and
other
soft
skills
.
Careers
like
consulting
would
give
you
many
of
them
and
you
could
use
them
in
any
future
career
,
of
course
!
,
and
majors
like
economics
and
public
policy
were
great
ways
to
teach
you
them
.
Computer
science
was
also
super
transferable
.
Even
if
you
didn't
want
to
work
for
a
large
tech
company
,
so
many
industries
also
had
a
need
for
tech
skills
.
Data
analysis
?
Every
place
needed
one
of
those
!
In
fact
surprise
many
of
Duke's
most
popular
majors
taught
you
transferable
skills
.
Part
of
the
appeal
of
a
liberal
arts
education
is
its
flexibility
regardless
of
the
specific
skills
that
are
in
demand
at
any
given
time
,
the
broader
principles
are
important
indefinitely
.
It's
adaptable
,
in
the
way
that
a
purely
vocational
training
may
not
be
.
And
yet
,
much
of
my
education
has
seemed
to
be
focused
on
two
things
getting
skills
preferably
transferable
ones
,
and
then
applying
said
skills
to
any
issue
.
nbsp
;
Sometimes
it
feels
like
high
school
again
,
where
the
goal
was
to
optimize
for
getting
into
a
good
college
you
can
decide
what
you're
interested
in
afterwards
!
What
gets
lost
in
this
process
?
What
happens
when
we
choose
to
sacrifice
specific
knowledge
and
context
in
lieu
of
broader
tools
?
For
one
,
there’s
the
narrowing
of
interests
.
Is
it
a
surprise
that
so
many
students
don't
know
what
specifically
they're
interested
in
,
when
that
never
seemed
to
be
a
focus
in
the
first
place
?
Sometimes
,
I
wonder
if
this
is
a
conspiracy
theory
.
Keep
us
uninformed
about
other
career
options
throughout
college
and
at
least
at
Duke
,
most
certainly
not
because
of
a
lack
of
resources
,
and
then
when
we’re
mildly
confused
and
very
insecure
,
tell
us
that
since
we
have
no
idea
what
we're
interested
in
,
to
go
down
a
specified
path
that
many
ahead
of
us
have
done
.
And
when
we
make
that
decision
,
it's
our
own
choice
right
?
Furthermore
,
the
narrower
a
skillset
,
the
narrower
the
range
of
problems
that
can
be
solved
.
I've
heard
people
mention
that
large
tech
companies
and
finance
are
the
only
place
where
software
engineers
are
treated
like
first
class
citizens
.
The
problems
in
other
industries
aren't
a
good
use
of
their
skills
.
Perhaps
nothing
is
wrong
with
that
.
Maybe
nothing
is
wrong
with
doing
work
in
an
industry
where
the
problems
are
challenging
and
interesting
and
well
defined
,
where
there's
a
strong
sense
of
satisfaction
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
surrounded
by
smart
,
interesting
people
?
At
the
same
time
,
it
seems
paradoxical
that
learning
skills
to
solve
a
broader
range
of
problems
instead
restricts
the
types
of
problems
that
are
perceived
to
be
worth
solving
.
And
when
entire
subcultures
of
Duke
are
built
around
a
shared
interest
in
acquiring
specific
skills
and
becoming
employed
,
the
humanistic
aspect
of
an
education
seems
to
be
lost
and
instead
become
a
collective
group
of
hammers
looking
for
a
nail
.
Finally
,
an
education
that
offers
skills
offers
very
little
guidance
on
how
those
tools
should
be
used
in
the
first
place
.
Programs
like
Data
teach
transferable
skills
and
promote
the
idea
that
data
science
can
revolutionize
everything
,
in
every
field
,
without
an
explicit
acknowledgement
that
the
kinds
of
things
that
are
measured
and
the
kind
of
data
that
is
released
and
made
public
often
has
strong
political
moviations
.
There
is
little
institutional
space
to
examine
whether
data
even
be
used
to
make
decisions
,
when
it
comes
to
high
stakes
decisions
,
like
prison
recidivism
and
teacher
evaluations
.
A
few
weeks
ago
,
sophomore
Christian
Sheerer
wrote
about
how

breeds
devils

don't
necessarily
like
that
characterization
of
my

I
like
to

that

go

,
funny
,
interesting
people
that
aren’t
destined
for
some
hell
bound
road
but
at
the
same
time
,
good
intentions
are
never
enough

Perhaps
I'm
a
hypocrite
.
I
chose
math
knowing
about
its
high
transferability
,
and
it's
helping
me
in
my
post
graduate
plans
.
The
process
of
learning
skills
is
fulfilling
and
interesting
to
me
,
and
I've
spent
enough
time
studying
math
in
Perkins
to
know
that
.
Sometimes
I
yearn
for
a
world
where
the
metrics
of
success
are
clear
,
where
the
problems
are
well
defined
,
and
where
I
have
the
tools
to
help
answer
them
,
in
the
way
many
of
my
classes
have
been
.
But
also
,
for
my
four
years
here
,
I've
been
hoping
that
someone
would
point
this
out
to
me
that
yes
,
I
may
be
able
to
acquire
skills
that
will
help
me
in
my
career
,
but
then
what
?
The
best
answer
I’ve
gotten
was
probably
during
Orientation
Week
,
after
meeting
my
advisor
for
the
first
time
.
After
describing
some
of
my
interests
,
he
said
,
math
and
science
are
great
tools
for
helping
to
explain
the
world
,
but
they're
not
the
kind
of
things
that
feed
your
soul
.
Three
years
later
,
I’m
still
wondering
whether
a
career
really
needs
to
feed
the
soul
,
but
until
then
,
I
would
like
to
focus
on
what
I'm
interested
in
,
and
not
on
optimizing
my
next
steps
.
My
junior
year
literature
teacher
wore
colorful
scarves
and
sang
the
Rolling
Stones
.
His
recounts
from
his
life
along
with
the
works
of
Shakespeare
and
Jane
Austen
and
others
made
his
class
a
collection
of
stories
.
As
the
leaves
turned
from
green
to
orange
outside
the
classroom
window
,
he
had
our
class
read
The
Love
Song
of
J
.
Alfred
Prufrock
for
a
homework
assignment
one
day
.
The
story
is
about
a
speaker
trapped
in
his
own
mind
.
He
goes
through
cycles
of
questioning
the
surrounding
world
,
which
leaves
him
feeling
paralyzed
and
unable
to
take
action
.
I
recalled
this
story
as
I
began
to
craft
a
Chronicle
article
about
religion
and
morality
.
I
was
writing
after
an
interfaith
panel
Honor
Council
hosted
about
religion
framing
moral
compasses
and
lifestyles
.
The
discussion
was
exceedingly
nuanced
.
Processing
this
event
for
me
became
perpetual
extrapolation
,
which
caused
the
writing
to
seem
too
lofty
.
I
considered
how
the
article
would
be
more
like
a
potential
object
of
satire
for
other
Chroniclers
.
Writing
the
article
critically
and
truthfully
while
acknowledging
its
limitations
and
that
my
ideas
are
in
constant
flux
presented
a
challenge
.
One
thought
led
to
the
next
until
I
was
approaching
the
article
with
such
a
broad
sweep
of
multifaceted
issues
,
and
I
was
essentially
becoming
trapped
in
my
mind
I
began
seeing
my
arguments
like
a
nearly
unsolvable
one
thousand
piece
puzzle
that
malevolent
designers
created
without
borders
or
a
picture
to
go
off
of

;
In
The
Love
Song
of
J
.
Alfred
Prufrock
,
the
speaker
exists
in
the
world
of
the
mind
.
There
is
a
tension
between
going
where
the
evening
is
spread
out
against
the
sky
and
the
command
let
us
go
where
the
evening
is
spread
out
against
the
sky
.
This
tension
is
between
critically
analyzing
our
selves
and
our
worlds
and
actually
living
in
them
.
And
per
my
mother’s
impeccable
advice
yes
,
I
need
to
think
critically
,
recognize
ambiguity
,
seek
to
understand
complex
themes
,
but
I
also
need
to
brush
my
teeth
.
I
need
to
step
out
of
the
clouds
and
into
my
world
.
I
am
ironically
considering
this
elusive
balance
between
considering
things
all
the
time
and
allowing
my
mind
to
rest
from
considering
things
all
the
time
.
Living
an
examined
life
calls
for
both
examining
and
living
out
the
multitudes
of
mundane
moments
that
constitute
living
.
The
balance
reminds
me
of
a
mountain
,
which
has
a
surrounding
valley
I
need
time
in
the
valley
to
spend
time
on
the
mountain
and
vice
versa
.
This
time
in
the
valley
is
the
margin
.
It
is
watching
the
rain
without
thinking
about
anything
in
particular
at
all
.
It
is
being
lost
in
a
piano
piece
just
to
play
,
or
joining
in
a
basketball
game
at
the
end
of
a
day
.
It
is
walking
around
without
a
destination
in
mind
,
or
talking
with
a
friend
who
on
the
plaza
you
happen
to
find
.
It
is
an
action
that
breaks
up
the
time
the
mind
is
spent
in
the
clouds
covering
the
mountain
.
In
this
time
,
the
focus
is
on
the
mundane
the
teeth
I
am
brushing
,
the
rain
I
am
watching
and
it
is
an
embracing
of
my
self
and
my
world
.
The
time
on
the
mountain
is
also
vital
in
learning
and
growing
.
It
is
a
time
examining
our
lives
,
engaging
in
necessary
and
difficult
conversations
about
the
crux
of
issues
,
and
asking
questions
about
purpose
and
meaning
.
Honor
Council
is
a
group
seeking
to
climb
the
mountain
,
with
one
foot
in
the
valley
and
one
foot
on
the
peak
.
We
aim
to
reconcile
margin
and
productivity
.
We
focus
on
action
the
most
important
part
of
the
Community
Standard
is
indeed
taking
action
in
the
face
of
moral
wrong
and
we
also
think
critically
about
what
is
moral
wrong
,
having
a
higher
moral
standard
for
a
diverse
community
,
and
many
other
ethical
questions
.
There
is
a
balance
between
analyzing
our
organization
and
focusing
outward
on
taking
action
in
the
community
.
My
call
to
action
is
finding
the
balance
between
taking
time
to
introspect
and
taking
action
to
make
positive
change
in
our
community
.
When
I
read
and
consider
opinions
and
ideas
,
I
find
myself
recalling
again
my
scarf
donning
teacher
and
his
class
and
how
the
balance
between
the
margin
and
mountain
meets
in
stories
.
Stories
bring
humanity
to
the
lofty
ideas
trapped
in
my
mind
,
and
they
bring
magic
to
the
moments
of
living
.
This
year
,
for
first
years
taking
the
Fall
2019
Writing
101
courses
,
a
course
called
Black
Feminism
in
Pop
Culture
was
offered
.
The
course
explores
topics
such
as
intersectionality
,
how
black
women
continue
to
be
marginalized
today
,
popular
cultural
movements
like
Blackgirlmagic
,
and
more
.
What
is
interesting
about
this
course
is
that
a
white
woman
,
Jessica
Covil
,
is
teaching
this
class
,
which
analyzes
historical
and
current
issues
of
race
and
inequality
through
a
black
feminist
lens
.
To
understand
more
about
the
dynamics
of
a
white
woman
teaching
this
course
,
I
contacted
Jessica
Covil
to
ask
her
a
few
questions
about
her
perspective
on
teaching
and
advocating
for
black
feminism
.
When
I
asked
Covil
about
the
course
as
a
whole
,
she
stated
that
Teaching
writing
through
a
Black
feminist
lens
offers
a
mode
of
inquiry
that
might
differ
from
other
Writing
101
courses
.
In
it
,
one
finds
an
attention
to
self
,
an
impulse
to
build
through
community
,
an
understanding
of
legacy
and
linkage
across
distinct
time
periods
,
and
much
more
.
In
this
statement
,
Covil
essentially
frames
the
black
feminist
lens
as
not
individual
to
a
black
feminist
,
but
an
overall
manner
of
thinking
.
When
I
asked
her
about
how
she
felt
her
role
fits
into
the
discussion
of
black
feminism
,
she
responded
that
she
is
merely
hoping
to
contribute
what
she
has
in
intellect
,
in
creativity
,
in
empathy
,
in
energy
.
Covil’s
intentions
and
her
professionalism
regarding
her
role
as
a
teacher
in
this
field
seem
well
founded
.
However
,
I
still
continue
to
question
the
true
validity
of
the
empathy
one
can
have
when
describing
the
social
identities
of
a
marginalized
group
in
which
they
have
not
understood
the
collective
experience
.
At
Duke
,
this
issue
is
not
only
embodied
in
the
one
instance
of
a
white
woman
teaching
a
black
feminism
course
.
In
fact
,
upon
coming
here
,
I
was
surprised
to
stumble
across
a
larger
culture
in
which
people
try
to
be
too
woke
.
Super
liberal
,
non
marginalized
people
attempt
to
involve
themselves
in
the
narratives
and
struggles
of
marginalized
communities
to
a
questionable
degree
.
In
a
way
that
may
be
masked
by
good
intent
,
their
advocacy
for
other
groups
can
actually
replace
the
voices
of
those
who
actually
possess
that
identity
.
I
don’t
want
to
single
out
this
specific
course
because
I
think
that
in
a
way
,
this
example
,
although
glaring
in
the
sense
that
it
has
occurred
on
an
institutional
level
,
is
realistically
a
less
extreme
example
in
the
way
that
Covil
has
maintained
a
distant
stance
.
One
student
from
her
class
made
the
observation
that
she
never
speaks
about
her
own
experiences
in
relation
to
the
plight
of
black
feminists
.
However
,
this
student
also
explained
that
Covil
has
not
experienced
how
her
background
affects
her
understanding
and
credibility
about
the
subject
in
general
,
which
is
something
that
should
be
addressed
.
Yet
on
a
student
level
,
I
believe
this
happens
in
a
more
blatant
way
.
In
an
attempt
to
support
the
plights
of
different
marginalized
groups
,
some
people
try
to
overlook
their
own
privilege
in
order
to
occupy
a
position
of
empowerment
for
these
communities
.
It
can
be
big
things
like
assuming
what
communities
of
color
want
on
campus
or
it
can
be
the
little
things
,
like
when
that
one
white
heterosexual
male
goes
Ugh
,
white
people
are
the
worst
.
When
I
hear
something
like
this
,
I
roll
my
eyes
.
Okay
Chad
,
how
would
you
understand
the
reality
of
white
oppression
in
a
way
that
makes
that
statement
genuine
to
your
own
perspective
?
nbsp
;
Instead
of
acknowledging
their
identity
in
conjunction
with
their
perspective
,
some
people
try
to
adopt
the
assumed
viewpoints
of
marginalized
people
in
some
type
of
outwardly
show
of
social
liberalism
.
Furthermore
,
in
an
attempt
to
swoop
in
and
be
a
voice
of
power
for
these
communities
,
these
people
actually
may
take
opportunities
away
from
those
with
marginalized
identities
who
have
a
deeper
connection
to
the
issue
.
Cashawn
Thompson
,
who
first
popularized
the
BlackGirlMagic
movement
,
stated
that
At
its
core
,
the
purpose
of
this
movement
is
to
create
a
platform
where
women
of
color
can
stand
together
against
the
stereotyping
,
colourism
,
misogyny
and
racism
that
is
often
their
lived
experience
.
If
a
white
woman
without
this
lived
experience
is
teaching
students
,
specifically
students
of
color
,
about
this
cultural
movement
,
are
the
deepest
cultural
impacts
and
relevance
really
still
there
?
Don’t
get
me
wrong
,
it’s
great
that
people
with
privilege
support
those
with
marginalized
identities
.
However
,
at
the
same
time
,
people
do
need
to
respect
the
boundaries
and
acknowledge
how
their
identity
defines
their
perspective
.
Sometimes
,
you
really
do
have
to
just
stay
in
your
lane
,
especially
when
it
comes
to
collective
experiences
of
race
,
identity
,
sexuality
,
and
gender
that
one
simply
does
not
have
.
At
the
end
of
the
day
,
being
woke
cool
.
It’s
important
for
people
to
be
aware
of
issues
concerning
racial
and
social
injustice
.
But
being
woke
to
the
point
where
one
ignores
the
reality
of
their
non
marginalized
identity
and
takes
key
positions
advocating
for
the
plight
of
other
communities
can
be
detrimental

This
performative
wokeness
takes
the
focus
off
those
who
understand
and
have
a
real
,
lived
connection
with
personal
issues
of
racial
and
social
injustice
.
And
in
this
way
,
it’s
not
helping
anyone
at
all
.
We
need
to
all
be
aware
of
our
identities
,
experiences
,
and
perspectives
and
not
try
to
overstep
those
of
others
in
order
to
be
seen
as
this
beacon
of
empowerment
and
social
liberalism
.
In
communities
that
are
not
your
own
,
you
don’t
need
to
scream
;
not
everyone
needs
to
hear
your
voice
.
Sometimes
,
it’s
better
to
just
listen
.
In
1999
,
the
state
of
North
Carolina
incarcerated
Lyle
May
in
Raleigh’s
Central
Prison
,
placing
him
on
death
row
.
North
Carolina
has
not
executed
anyone
since
2006
,
so
while
he
probably
won’t
be
subject
to
the
form
of
state
sanctioned
murder
known
as
the
death
penalty
though
as
long
as
execution
exists
,
his
fate
is
uncertain
,
he
will
almost
certainly
never
leave
prison
.
In
2004
,
despite
the
criminal
legal
system’s
attempts
to
completely
sever
Lyle
from
society
,
he
began
correspondence
courses
with
the
University
of
North
Carolina
at
Chapel
Hill
,
Adams
State
University
,
and
Ohio
University
.
These
courses
allowed
him
to
earn
college
credit
,
an
associate’s
degree
,
and
progress
toward
a
bachelor’s
degree
from
a
distance
,
and
his
education
blossomed
into
public
writings
for
his
own
blog
and
outlets
like
and
Lyle
leverages
his
platform
,
education
,
and
experience
to
draw
attention
to
prison
conditions
and
explore
his
own
humanity
as
his
time
behind
bars
extends
day
by
day
.
Yet
,
inexplicably
,
prison
officials
in
North
Carolina
have
started
obstructing
Lyle’s
access
to
Ohio
University’s
classes
the
warden
of
Central
Prison
,
reflecting
the
common
sense’
view
our
society
has
of
incarcerated
people
,
told
Lyle
that
death
row
inmates
are
not
in
prison
to
be
rehabilitated
.
Despite
Lyle’s
diligent
pursuit
of
his
education
,
his
access
to
it
has
always
been
tenuous
,
dependent
on
the
whims
of
a
system
fundamentally
hostile
to
the
rights
and
dignity
of
incarcerated
people
.
Nonetheless
,
Lyle’s
effort
to
increase
access
to
higher
education
resources
in
prison
is
rooted
in
a
deep
lineage
of
incarcerated
people
asserting
their
right
to
public
education
and
fair
,
humane
treatment
.
For
example
On
September
9
,
1971
,
following
a
series
of
peaceful
protests
over
atrocious
conditions
at
Attica
Correctional
Facility
in
upstate
New
York
,
over
1200
incarcerated
mostly
Puerto
Rican
and
Black
men
revolted
and
took
over
an
entire
wing
of
the
prison
.
L
.
D
.
Barkley
,
one
of
the
uprising’s
leaders
,
declared
,
The
entire
incident
that
has
erupted
here
at
Attica
is
a
result
of
the
unmitigated
oppression
wrought
by
the
racist
administrative
network
of
this
prison
throughout
the
year
.
We
are
men
.
We
are
not
beasts
and
we
do
not
intend
to
be
beaten
or
driven
as
such
.
The
Attica
Brothers
demanded
realistic
rehabilitation
programs
,
a
healthy
diet
,
and
modernization
of
the
inmate
education
system
.
Many
of
the
men
incarcerated
at
Attica
were
politically
conscious
,
radicalized
by
movements
for
Black
Power
or
groups
like
the
Young
Lords
Party
,
and
thus
knew
their
education
was
a
weapon
to
confront
the
broader
injustices
they
faced
something
New
York’s
prison
officials
knew
,
too
.
On
September
13th
,
Governor
Nelson
Rockefeller
ordered
the
retaking
of
the
prison
,
brutally
murdering
over
40
people
and
extinguishing
the
Attica
Uprising
.
Nonetheless
,
Attica’s
legacy
persists
,
through
organized
actions
like
the
2018
National
Prison
Strike
and
the
advocacy
of
those
like
Lyle
,
who
remain
subject
to
the
brutality
of
jails
and
prisons
.
Despite
numerous
,
vigorous
efforts
,
education
in
prisons
today
remains
piecemeal
at
best
and
non
existent
at
worst
.
For
over
150
years
,
from
the
establishment
of
public
schools
by
Reconstruction
governments
,
to
,
to
Attica
and
today’s
teachers’
strikes
,
millions
of
Americans
have
fought
for
access
to
public
education
and
its
crucial
role
in
dismantling
political
,
economic
,
and
social
injustice
.
One
of
the
most
urgent
battlegrounds
in
the
fight
for
public
education
today
continues
to
take
place
in
the
gray
wastes
housing
the
condemned
and
largely
forgotten
incarcerated
people
.
Access
to
education
in
prison
has
long
been
contentious
and
contingent
.
From
1972
to
1995
,
sparked
by
Attica
and
pushed
for
by
incarcerated
people
,
those
not
sentenced
to
death
or
life
without
parole
could
receive
federal
Pell
Grants
to
enroll
in
any
one
of
350
postsecondary
prison
programs
in
37
states
.
In
1994
,
the
infamous
Violent
Crime
Control
and
Law
Enforcement
Act
enthusiastically
supported
by
Republicans
and
Democrats
alike
,
including
Joe
Biden
ended
the
Pell
Grant
program
for
incarcerated
people
and
made
higher
education
in
prison
rare
,
absent
support
from
private
universities
and
colleges
.
Since
1994
,
programs
like
the
Bard
Prison
Initiative
founded
by
undergraduates
in
1999
and
the
Prison
University
Project
at
San
Quentin
State
Prison
founded
in
2003
emerged
to
fill
the
void
created
by
the
Crime
Bill
which
also
meant
that
many
incarcerated
people
were
excluded
,
dependent
on
institutional
support
and
resources
.
In
2015
,
the
Obama
Administration
launched
the
Second
Chance
Pell
Grant
program
to
loosen
up
funding
for
prison
education
surprisingly
extended
by
the
Trump
administration
and
there’s
legislation
pending
in
Congress
to
reverse
the
educational
restrictions
of
the
Crime
Bill
.
The
Second
Chance
program
,
while
significant
,
is
still
incomplete
,
excluding
those
with
drug
convictions
among
numerous
other
eligibility
restrictions
.
John
J
.
Lennon
,
serving
a
sentence
of
28
years
to
life
in
Sing
Sing
prison
in
upstate
New
York
,
recently
described
in
the
consequences
of
unequal
access
to
education
for
incarcerated
people
,
such
access
being
essential
for
surviving
in
prison
and
successfully
living
outside
of
it
.
Most
arguments
for
prison
education
repeat
the
same
statistics
these
programs
would
reduce
state
correctional
costs
by
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
,
reduce
the
chance
of
recidivism
by
43
to
72
percent
,
increase
the
chance
of
employment
and
make
conditions
inside
prisons
safer
.
These
factors
are
important
,
usually
deployed
to
sway
efficient
minded
,
traditionally
pragmatic
nbsp
;
policymakers
.
But
often
minimized
,
if
not
lost
,
in
this
conversation
is
the
moral
argument
for
educational
justice
incarcerated
people
are
,
like
the
rest
of
us
,
entitled
to
free
public
education
.
Those
who
end
up
in
jail
or
prison
do
not
forfeit
their
humanity
when
they’re
locked
behind
bars
.
And
a
movement
for
access
to
higher
education
in
prison
can
be
an
important
tool
in
reducing
the
power
and
reach
of
the
criminal
legal
system
as
we
move
toward
its
abolition
.
Education
alone
cannot
rectify
social
and
economic
inequality
,
but
we
know
it
can
reduce
the
likelihood
that
people
return
to
prison
.
In
explaining
his
choice
to
pursue
college
courses
,
Lyle
reminds
us
,
There
needed
to
be
something
more
than
the
poison
of
prison
air
that
lethal
combination
of
hatred
,
bitterness
,
and
ignorance
that
rots
mind
,
body
,
and
soul
.
The
question
of
prison
education
,
part
and
parcel
of
a
much
larger
campaign
to
invest
in
communities
and
ultimately
eliminate
prisons
,
offers
us
a
choice
whether
we
act
in
solidarity
with
those
targeted
by
a
racist
,
classist
,
misogynist
,
ableist
,
homophobic
,
and
transphobic
institution
,
or
remain
silent
and
co
sign
on
its
violence
.

There’s
another
question
,
pertinent
to
us
,
raised
by
the
debate
over
prison
education
what
might
it
mean
for
us
to
demand
Duke
expand
its
academic
resources
to
people
in
prison
?
Prison
higher
education
programs
are
relatively
sparse
in
the
South
though
the
University
of
North
Carolina
system
and
Duke
Divinity
School’s
Project
TURN
,
among
others
,
have
prioritized
implementing
their
own
smaller
scale
programs
and
Duke
taking
the
step
to
invest
in
prison
education
could
be
a
model
for
the
region
and
a
boost
to
existing
efforts
.
Resources
are
increasingly
available
,
too
,
whether
from
Duke
or
philanthropic
organizations
like
the
Mellon
Foundation
.
If
Duke
were
to
also
provide
a
pathway
from
incarceration
to
financially
supported
enrollment
in
degree
programs
post
release
,
it
would
not
only
expand
educational
access
further
,
but
radically
challenge
,
scholar
Elizabeth
Hinton
asked
,
Will
colleges
begin
to
address
and
reflect
the
world
around
them
?
Higher
education
isn’t
a
silver
bullet
and
my
trust
in
this
University
is
tepid
,
at
best
but
Hinton’s
words
ring
true
.
Duke’s
resources
have
some
role
to
play
in
eradicating
the
violence
produced
and
reproduced
by
our
existing
criminal
punishment
system
.
In
the
meantime
,
we
must
take
seriously
the
concerns
and
demands
of
incarcerated
people
like
Lyle
May
,
John
J
.
Lennon
,
and
so
many
others
.
In
Lyle’s
case
,
continue
to
follow
for
updates
on
his
situation
and
ways
we
can
take
action
from
the
outside
on
his
behalf
.
On
campus
,
let’s
more
seriously
investigate
Duke’s
relationship
to
the
criminal
legal
system
and
the
beast
that
is
the
prison
industrial
complex
and
force
the
University
to
not
only
better
reflect
our
world
,
but
invest
in
upending
it
.
In
my
first
three
semesters
at
Duke
,
I’ve
changed
my
intended
major
more
than
anyone
I
know
.
I’ve
floated
around
as
any
combination
of
English
,
Econ
,
Psychology
,
CompSci
and
IDM
.
Coming
in
as
strongly
undecided
but
hopeful
,
I
wanted
to
immerse
myself
into
the
humanities
,
but
I
knew
that
ultimately
,
because
of
complicated
cultural
and
familial
factors
,
I
was
going
to
settle
into
something
practical
.
As
a
first
year
,
I
tried
to
balance
these
motives
by
taking
Personality
Psychology
and
CompSci
101
in
the
same
semester
,
Creative
Writing
and
Econ
101
in
the
next
.
It’s
hard
to
boil
down
my
inclination
to
practicality
when
I
based
my
entire
college
application
on
my
interests
in
psychology
and
creative
writing
.
But
at
the
core
,
they
derive
from
family
related
expectations
.
After
getting
into
Duke
,
my
mother
expressed
her
belief
that
the
primary
reason
behind
sending
me
to
such
an
expensive
school
was
to
expose
me
to
high
paying
employers
.
Years
ago
,
I
definitely
crushed
her
dreams
when
I
announced
that
I
was
never
going
to
pursue
medicine
.
I
know
that
her
concern
for
me
only
stems
from
love
.
I
know
that
when
my
parents
moved
to
America
,
they
were
so
poor
that
they
drove
a
100
used
car
,
and
they
only
escaped
financial
turmoil
by
obtaining
graduate
degrees
in
computer
science
and
engineering
,
and
then
finding
stable
,
well
paying
jobs
in
these
fields
.
Education
was
their
way
out
.
So
were
the
sciences
.
Now
,
they
are
investing
their
hard
earned
money
into
my
future
,
so
I
feel
an
exigence
to
justify
their
sacrifice
.
In
this
same
vein
,
nearly
all
of
my
Asian
friends
at
Duke
are
pursuing
traditionally
practical
pathways
,
whether
they
take
the
form
of
a
pre
med
track
,
engineering
,
economics
,
computer
science
,
statistics
,
or
public
policy
.
Conversely
,
the
people
I
know
pursuing
majors
such
as
English
and
psychology
,
are
mostly
caucasian
.
In
a
2015
survey
that
broke
down
categories
of
college
majors
by
race
,
Asians
nbsp
;
made
up
by
far
the
highest
percentage
of
STEM
majors
,
at
30
percent
,
whereas
the
next
highest
group
had
approximately
half
of
that
,
at
16
percent
.
I
do
not
believe
that
this
is
because
Asian
students
have
little
interest
in
the
humanities
or
social
sciences
.
A
sizeable
number
of
talented
Asian
students
participated
in
my
year
of
Project
Arts
,
but
as
far
as
I’m
aware
,
they
are
all
pursuing
one
of
the
practical
majors
I
listed
above
.
Recently
,
the
full
implications
of
this
demographic
division
surfaced
for
me
when
I
attended
DEMAN
weekend
.
Although
I
was
only
there
for
a
few
hours
,
about
twenty
five
panelists
spoke
over
the
course
of
the
two
sessions
I
attended
.
Strikingly
,
not
a
single
one
of
them
were
Asian
East
,
Southeast
,
South
or
Middle
Eastern
at
least
visibly
so
.
There
is
a
tendency
,
especially
in
Asian
families
,
one
white
alumni
said
at
one
panel
,
to
emphasize
.
In
the
music
industry
,
this
disparity
is
perhaps
even
more
pronounced
.
Only
as
recently
as
2018
,
the
members
of
the
K
pop
band
BTS
became
the
first
Asian
artists
to
top
the
Billboard
200
with
their
album
.
Clearly
,
as
seen
by
the
popularity
of
the
aforementioned
films
,
as
well
as
the
insurgence
of
recent
Asian
singers
such
as
Mitski
,
there
is
a
market
for
the
consumption
of
Asian
American
art
not
that
this
should
be
a
question
in
the
first
place
.
In
spite
of
the
acclaim
garnered
by
these
works
,
it
has
not
been
enough
to
eradicate
the
stereotypes
faced
by
Asians
as
a
collective
,
or
their
consequences
.
We
are
seen
at
analytical
,
but
not
emotional
.
We
are
perceived
to
have
hard
skills
,
but
not
any
soft
skills
or
communications
talent
.
However
,
the
paradox
is
that
by
pursuing
practical
majors
and
professions
,
a
self
handicapping
takes
place
in
which
we
inadvertently
reinforce
these
inaccurate
archetypes
.
As
a
student
,
and
one
who
frankly
has
very
little
figured
out
,
there
is
not
much
I
can
do
to
sway
other
Asian
students’
decisions
regarding
their
majors
.
I
intend
to
major
in
English
,
but
even
with
my
convictions
about
the
importance
of
Asian
representation
in
the
arts
,
I
know
I
will
double
with
another
major
of
which
my
mom
will
approve
.
However
,
I
believe
that
if
we
are
cognisant
of
the
dearth
of
Asian
representation
in
the
humanities
and
their
related
job
industries
,
we
can
start
with
smaller
steps
.
Too
often
,
minority
students
compromise
their
intellectual
passions
for
promised
financial
stability
,
but
this
should
not
be
the
case
.
This
is
an
open
suggestion
for
Duke
to
hire
more
minority
faculty
across
the
board
,
but
especially
in
the
humanities
and
social
sciences
.
This
is
an
invitation
for
students
to
explore
non
practical
subjects
that
interest
them
,
despite
the
constraints
of
their
family
or
culture一to
take
even
one
class
or
two
in
film
or
history
or
sociology
.
This
is
an
encouragement
for
any
of
them
nbsp
;
to
pursue
a
career
in
theatre
or
journalism
,
with
or
without
a
concurrent
degree
in
economics
or
computer
science
.
Nietzsche
and
Kant
are
holding
hands
.
Well
,
their
tiny
felt
replicas
are
,
as
puppets
magnetized
to
Michael
Gillespie’s
fridge
.
Gillespie
is
a
longtime
Duke
professor
and
renowned
political
theorist
specializing
in
theology
and
German
existentialism
.
Duke
pays
him
to
talk
to
students
about
how
to
lead
a
meaningful
life
,
but
today
we’re
talking
about
his
cats
,
his
kid
and
his
wife’s
apple
crisp
.
When
I
first
met
Professor
Gillespie
on
a
high
school
visit
to
Duke
,
I
decided
he
was
my
personal
Dumbledore
.
The
physical
resemblance
is
strong
Gillespie
,
who
rotates
through
a
multicolored
array
of
turtlenecks
and
keeps
his
white
beard
neatly
trimmed
,
looks
like
the
Hogwarts
headmaster
assimilated
into
muggle
society
.
But
still
more
Dumbledore
like
is
his
thirst
to
acquire
and
pass
on
knowledge
.
He
started
with
his
son
his
greatest
student
,
as
he
told
us
,
then
the
Visions
of
Freedom
FOCUS
,
then
the
AB
Duke
merit
scholars
,
helping
students
build
lives
for
their
passions
.
So
the
puppets
on
the
fridge
make
total
sense
.
They’re
among
the
giants
of
Gillespie’s
field
,
yes
,
but
here
they’re
softened
to
playful
caricatures
,
now
accessible
.
And
they’re
holding
hands
we’re
not
alone
on
the
road
.
The
camera
around
my
neck
keeps
me
out
of
the
line
of
fire
that
is
Gillespie’s
providence
over
his
own
kitchen
.
Margot
is
less
fortunate
.
She
cores
apples
under
his
close
watch
while
from
afar
I
fiddle
with
my
manual
focus
.
Oh
no
no
,
her
technique
is
all
wrong
.
.
Gosh
,
does
it
make
the
man
giggle
.
We’re
studying
a
cat
with
Charlie
Chaplin
painted
on
its
nether
end
when
the
timer
goes
off
.
Back
in
the
kitchen
,
we
attend
the
steaming
leviathan
.
The
thing
is
massive
.
With
the
touch
of
a
spoon
,
its
bronze
dome
parts
to
reveal
a
bountiful
pool
of
juices
I’m
stunned
it
didn’t
overflow
in
the
oven
.
Right
now
,
it’s
too
hot
to
eat
,
Gillespie
muses
,
unless
,
of
course
,
we
pull
out
the
vanilla
ice
cream
.
He
doesn’t
ask
how
many
scoops
we
want
.
Three
each
this
,
apparently
,
is
how
it’s
done
.
And
soon
we
understand
why
;
the
stuff
melts
into
the
steaming
juice
and
forms
a
sort
of
ambrosial
gravy
.
We
never
learn
why
he
chose
this
extra
special
occasion
goliath
of
a
dessert
for
tonight
,
but
he
does
tell
us
that
people
have
a
maximum
of
seven
or
eight
decisions
they
can
make
in
a
day
,
and
deciding
on
this
tart
was
one
.
We’re
thankful
for
that
.
A
recent
article
in
the
Chronicle
criticized
how
many
newly
grads
find
themselves
on
a
moral
descent
as
they
enter
the
workforce
.
Trinity
sophomore
Christian
Sheerer
writes
that
becoming
bad
people
that
do
bad
things
is
somewhat
of
an
unspoken
Duke
destiny
,
clutching
onto
wealth
as
a
measure
of
success
.
The
pomp
,
power
,
and
prestige
that
surrounds
recruitment
season
is
unmistakable
,
and
it’s
no
wonder
why
many
Duke
students
pursue
this
route
.
Whether
for
financial
security
or
stability
it’s
safe
.
I
have
no
shortage
of
Chronicle
articles
stuffed
in
my
back
pocket
,
ready
to
take
down
the
perceived
monolith
of
preprofessionalism
.
Don’t
get
me
wrong
,
it’s
a
problem
worthy
of
endless
critique
,
but
I’m
beginning
to
realize
there’s
a
little
more
nuance
to
the
debate
.
Discourse
on
preprofessionalism
has
devolved
into
a
recycling
of
empty
phrases
about
the
sell
out
culture
,
sandwiched
between
quips
evoking
images
of
mercenary
,
snake
like
Duke
students
.
Full
disclosure
I’m
guilty
of
this
too
.
Students
are
privy
to
the
cultish
obsession
a
portion
of
Duke
undergraduates
have
with
top
consulting
firms
.
One
student
,
Trinity
sophomore
Alex
Chao
,
posted
a
satirical
meme
on
the
Duke
Memes
for
Gothicc
Teens
Facebook
page
reflecting
on
the
sell
out
culture
,
shown
below
.
Cynicism
and
jest
aside
,
Chao’s
adaptation
of
the
hierarchy
,
perhaps
unintentionally
,
raises
a
salient
point
.
Twentieth
century
psychologist
Abraham
Maslow
devised
a
Hierarchy
of
Needs
to
explain
the
motivating
factors
of
human
behavior
,
from
basic
physiological
and
safety
needs
to
esteem
and
self
actualization
.
From
the
looks
of
it
,
Duke
students
are
stuck
somewhere
on
the
ascent
,
not
quite
hoisting
themselves
onto
the
level
of
self
actualization
,
the
fulfillment
of
one’s
talents
and
life
purpose
.
Perhaps
to
gain
a
sense
of
belonging
,
following
the
herd
of
students
to
recruitment
events
provides
affirmation
;
or
maybe
to
feel
accomplished
and
self
confident
,
students
feverishly
line
up
summer
internship
opportunities
from
the
get
go
.
But
how
much
of
this
instead
stems
from
a
false
consensus
that
reflexively
attributes
Duke
students
to
the
econ
sell
out
trope
?

A
survey
of
graduating
seniors
between
2012
and
2017
collected
by
the
Duke
Career
Center
,
found
that
there
is
actually
a
fair
amount
of
post
graduate
plan
diversity
.
The
visualization
above
demonstrates
disciplinary
pathways
to
a
wide
range
of
careers
and
graduate
professional
school
programs
.
The
numbers
don’t
lie
students
do
more
than
land
jobs
at
Facebook
or
Google
.
A
large
number
of
students
report
going
to
graduate
school
34
.
6
or
scientific
tech
fields
19
.
1
over
business
18
.
2
.
Looking
at
the
graph
,
it’s
also
important
to
note
that
there
is
a
fair
amount
of
representation
,
while
not
nearly
as
concentrated
,
in
fields
such
as
service
amp
;
education
,
engineering
,
politics
amp
;
media
,
among
others
.
So
,
why
does
this
matter
?
The
idea
of
false
consensus
,
which
is
an
attributional
bias
where
people
overestimate
how
widely
accepted
their
own
perspectives
are
relative
to
others
,
offers
an
explanation
for
why
students
hold
sacrosanct
this
indistinct
yet
prevailing
conception
that
just
about
everyone
is
a
sell
out
.
And
in
order
to
ascribe
to
this
notion
,
you
only
need
to
meet
a
minimum
threshold
of
exposure
through
social
media
,
conversations
,
and
personal
observations
to
perceive
it
as
true
.
Sometimes
this
threshold
is
met
before
students
even
arrive
on
campus
for
the
first
time
,
expedited
through
mechanisms
such
as
the
student
Facebook
meme
page
,
for
instance
.
Yes
,
it
is
important
to
characterize
,
expose
,
and
reprimand
how
the
pre
professional
culture
dominates
campus
.
But
perhaps
the
reason
it
reigns
king
is
because
we
reinforce
it
.
We
allow
it
to
steer
our
motivations
and
commandeer
our
scope
of
possibility
.
Trivializing
pre
professionalism
through
jokes
or
condemning
the
transformation
of
postgraduates
into
capitalistic
devils
certainly
builds
visibility
,
but
doesn’t
cut
the
virus
from
its
power
source
.
To
do
that
we
need
to
change
the
paradigm
.
A
few
weeks
ago
I
attended
a
panel
featuring
Provost
Sally
Kornbluth
,
Vice
Provost
for
Student
Affairs
Mary
Pat
McMahon
and
Vice
Provost
for
Undergraduate
Education
Gary
Bennett
at
Blackwell
dorm
on
East
Campus
.
According
to
Vice
Provost
McMahon
on
East
Campus
several
weeks
ago
,
there
are
exciting
changes
afoot
in
Duke
Career
Center
leadership
and
program
structures
that
will
help
expand
visibility
to
less
known
career
paths
.
While
specific
details
have
yet
to
be
revealed
,
McMahon
believes
that
this
will
help
combat
the
stigmatization
many
students
feel
when
their
post
graduate
aspirations
don’t
align
with
the
dominant
pre
professional
culture
.
Because
clearly
students
do
more
than
sell
their
souls
and
care
more
than
just
to
secure
the
bag
so
why
don’t
we
celebrate
that
?
Like
any
marginally
provocative
article
,
it’s
my
hope
that
people
take
this
idea
to
heart
.
Sheerer
raised
some
strong
points
.
Even
if
there
are
only
a
handful
of
students
who
graduate
securing
lucrative
,
unethical
positions
of
power
,
it
is
enough
to
question
whether
Duke
actually
teaches
us
how
to
be
ethical
.
But
it
is
equally
as
important
to
shed
light
towards
those
who
pursue
fulfilling
careers
that
allow
them
to
make
a
difference
.
The
biggest
takeaway
don’t
sell
out
to
the
sell
out
culture
.
Ever
since
I
was
a
kid
,
I’ve
loved
animals
.
I
never
had
a
pet
while
growing
up
,
but
from
an
early
age
,
I
learned
to
admire
the
many
creatures
that
inhabit
our
planet
.
Despite
this
great
love
,
meat
has
always
been
a
large
part
of
my
diet
.
Both
of
my
parents
fueled
my
carnivorous
lifestyle
my
mom
controlled
the
stove
and
oven
while
my
dad
commandeered
the
grill
.
I
don’t
blame
my
parents
for
raising
me
on
meat
;
after
all
,
humans
have
a
long
history
of
animal
slaughter
for
human
consumption
,
and
it
is
also
very
difficult
to
give
up
meat
even
though
live
without
it
.
I
don’t
even
see
anything
wrong
with
eating
meat
in
theory
my
continued
role
in
the
meat
industry
was
only
a
problem
for
me
because
of
the
currently
brutal
animal
treatment
.
As
hard
as
it
was
to
give
up
,
it
felt
hypocritical
to
claim
to
be
an
advocate
for
animal
rights
while
still
contributing
to
the
demand
for
meat
,
so
I
finally
made
the
switch
.
While
not
exclusively
vegan
because
I
still
eat
seafood
,
my
animal
conscious
and
also
climate
conscious
diet
has
been
pretty
successful
.
But
despite
my
strong
desire
to
stop
eating
most
animal
products
,
it’s
been
very
difficult
for
me
to
make
such
a
drastic
change
.
I
miss
so
many
different
meals
,
but
it’s
not
even
that
.
My
big
problem
is
that
nbsp
;
I
don’t
know
how
to
psychologically
move
on
from
the
idea
of
meat
completely
.
That’s
why
meat
alternatives
like
tofu
and
tempeh
have
been
really
important
to
me
this
semester
.
In
case
you
haven’t
jumped
on
the
bandwagon
yet
,
alternative
meat
is
becoming
more
and
more
commonplace
.
But
as
new
as
the
idea
may
seem
,
tofu
has
potentially
existed
for
as
long
as
2
,
000
years
.
In
a
more
modern
sense
,
meat
analogues
started
to
emerge
in
the
late
19th
century
,
though
they
were
far
less
common
before
the
past
few
decades
.
Yet
the
idea
only
seems
to
have
become
mainstream
now
when
fast
food
chains
like
Burger
King
are
selling
meat
substitutes
nationwide
.
Duke
has
already
started
to
expand
access
to
meat
alternatives
,
as
well
,
but
it
should
take
a
larger
role
in
this
trend
.
Duke
has
made
a
lot
of
progress
for
being
inclusive
towards
veganism
there
are
numerous
different
vegan
protein
sources
available
so
far
but
it
still
has
more
it
could
do
.
Unlike
more
traditional
vegan
meals
,
meat
analogues
have
an
especially
critical
role
in
distancing
ourselves
from
the
meat
industry
because
they
are
better
gateways
into
flexitarian
or
vegetarian
lifestyles
.
But
those
options
are
less
visible
on
campus
than
they
should
be
.
While
every
restaurant
on
campus
has
a
vegan
option
,
vegan
substitutes
that
mimic
meat
are
less
common
.
Sprout
obviously
has
its
mock
chicken
nuggets
,
at
least
a
dozen
other
restaurants
offer
tofu
similar
soy
products
,
and
even
vegan
burgers
are
becoming
more
commonplace
.
Regardless
,
there
are
still
many
restaurants
without
a
true
vegan
substitute
for
meat
a
good
number
of
these
restaurants
offer
beans
,
hummus
,
or
portobello
mushrooms
as
the
main
vegan
protein
,
but
it’s
just
not
the
same
.
A
large
part
of
the
problem
is
my
inability
to
escape
the
framework
of
the
meat
centered
meal
,
but
I
know
I
can’t
be
alone
in
this
struggle
.
Duke
is
already
an
inclusive
campus
for
vegans
relative
to
other
colleges
,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
we
should
stop
.
And
I
don’t
think
it
will
the
temporary
return
of
Big
Bowl
and
the
recent
addition
of
Impossible
Burgers
to
the
Krafthouse
menu
are
both
good
signs
for
the
future
.
But
attempts
at
vegetarian
,
flexitarian
and
especially
vegan
diets
are
still
daunting
lifestyle
changes
,
so
Duke
can
help
make
those
changes
easier
by
promoting
current
vegetarian
vegan
options
and
continually
offering
new
ones
alternative
meat
most
critically
across
campus
.
On
Friday
,
many
students
will
send
in
their
applications
for
DukeEngage
,
the
summer
volunteering
program
comprised
of
both
domestic
and
international
projects
.
Students
will
get
the
opportunity
to
teach
English
in
China
,
practice
environmental
conservation
in
Thailand
or
create
culturally
responsive
educational
tools
in
Chicago
.
When
they
go
,
they
bring
with
them
the
ideal
of
doing
good
in
communities
around
the
world
.
The
result
,
however
,
is
not
always
as
glamorous
.
Student
experiences
vary
widely
,
and
many
others
lampoon
DukeEngage
for
simply
being
voluntourism
or
perpetuating
the
savior
narrative
.
Considering
the
amount
of
money
that
is
poured
into
DukeEngage
every
year
,
this
presents
a
problem
the
program
may
not
even
be
reaching
its
purported
goals
.
DukeEngage
is
an
example
of
a
good
idea
that
is
poorly
executed
.
The
website
claims
that
the
program
is
meant
to
empower
students
to
address
critical
human
needs
by
fully
funding
a
summer
of
immersive
service
,
in
the
process
transforming
students
,
advancing
the
University’s
educational
mission
,
and
providing
meaningful
assistance
to
communities
in
the
U
.
S
.
and
abroad
.
However
,
the
program
instead
reveals
a
telling
indication
of
privilege
it
fosters
performative
altruism
instead
of
genuine
empathy
.
What
is
the
difference
between
performative
altruism
and
empathy
?
Performative
altruism
is
doing
something
for
the
benefit
of
another
because
it
benefits
oneself
,
usually
in
the
form
of
social
clout
or
improved
reputation
.
Empathy
is
,
colloquially
,
putting
yourself
in
someone
else’s
shoes
.
It
does
not
necessarily
entail
an
act
of
altruism
,
but
it
does
require
looking
through
another’s
perspective
.
The
key
problem
is
the
fact
that
DukeEngage
is
not
motivated
by
empathy
.
While
most
students
probably
apply
to
the
program
motivated
by
the
ideal
of
doing
good
for
others
,
learning
from
the
local
community
,
and
engaging
with
the
culture
,
often
,
the
program
does
not
offer
that
possibility
because
it
frames
the
students
as
privileged
outsiders
.
Instead
,
the
program
serves
as
a
way
to
bolster
Duke’s
reputation
.
On
Duke’s
Global
Affairs
page
,
they
list
DukeEngage
as
one
of
the
top
cited
reasons
why
prospective
students
choose
Duke
.
Duke
is
consequently
aware
of
DukeEngage’s
reputation
and
its
beneficial
effects
for
the
school
.
Unless
it
is
an
essential
part
of
the
program
,
students
do
not
interact
with
locals
.
If
they
do
,
it
is
through
the
lens
of
their
service
.
This
relationship
has
two
effects
.
First
,
it
separates
the
students
from
the
local
culture
,
clearly
segregating
their
communities
.
Second
,
it
fosters
a
savior
complex
,
where
students
are
positioned
as
helping
and
therefore
are
positioned
as
powerful
.
This
kind
of
relationship
builds
the
idea
that
Duke
students
are
part
of
an
elite
community
,
and
that
lesser
privileged
communities
require
their
help
to
build
themselves
up
.
In
addition
,
the
ineffectualness
of
many
programs
reinforces
the
performative
aspect
because
the
mission
is
not
actually
achieved
.
Many
students
report
that
the
programs
were
disorganized
and
they
did
not
feel
that
they
had
made
a
difference
.
One
student
called
the
UK
program
a
complete
waste
of
time
and
a
marketing
ploy
.
Another
student
I
talked
to
in
the
China
program
said
that
they
didn’t
do
anything
.
Although
DukeEngage
has
these
problems
,
it
is
not
without
benefit
.
It
operates
on
the
principle
of
service
learning
for
education
,
which
has
many
benefits
,
including
the
development
of
civic
identity
and
responsibility
.
To
achieve
these
goals
,
however
,
the
program
needs
to
be
reworked
.
Without
actually
engaging
with
local
communities
,
students
will
not
be
able
to
see
themselves
as
a
part
of
them
.
For
example
,
while
environmental
conservation
directly
helps
the
members
of
the
local
area
,
it
also
helps
the
global
community
as
a
whole
.
Understanding
one’s
position
in
relation
to
a
community
will
lead
to
empathy
and
a
sense
of
civic
responsibility
.
One
way
to
facilitate
this
result
would
be
to
have
weekly
discussions
during
the
program
to
discuss
what
has
concretely
been
accomplished
,
plan
for
future
goals
,
and
reflect
on
their
roles
and
responsibilities
.
With
empathy
and
civic
responsibility
,
we
stay
motivated
because
we
care
and
understand
our
duty
to
contribute
to
the
world
in
a
meaningful
way
.
If
DukeEngage
is
able
to
foster
these
traits
,
then
students
will
continue
to
do
genuine
altruism
in
the
future
,
not
for
reputation
or
for
a
paid
trip
to
voluntour
.
On
October
29
,
the
NCAA
Board
of
Governors
announced
its
unanimous
vote
to
allow
student
athletes
to
benefit
from
the
use
of
their
name
,
image
and
likeness
.
The
specifics
are
not
yet
set
in
stone
,
but
essentially
student
athletes
and
their
families
will
no
longer
be
banned
for
profiting
off
of
hosting
Youtube
channels
,
selling
T
shirts
,
and
other
activities
.
The
vote
is
a
long
delayed
victory
for
student
athletes
who
have
seen
the
NCAA
amass
1
billion
in
revenue
over
the
years
while
they
themselves
have
sometimes
been
restricted
to
stipends
of
no
more
than
5
,
000
per
semester
.
Critically
,
this
decision
did
not
come
from
a
sudden
change
of
heart
nor
from
a
constitutional
obligation
to
athletes’
First
Amendment
rights
.
Rather
,
the
NCAA
vote
came
in
the
midst
of
mounting
pressure
,
most
notably
from
California
.
Disregarding
the
objections
of
the
NCAA
and
some
universities
that
were
worried
about
revenue
loss
,
the
California
state
legislature
unanimously
passed
a
bill
this
summer
which
allows
student
athletes
to
hire
agents
and
pursue
opportunities
to
profit
from
their
images
.
The
state’s
audacious
stance
prompted
other
states
to
consider
similar
measures
and
even
inspired
a
national
forum
in
D
.
C
.
As
much
as
this
vote
is
a
victory
for
student
athletes
,
it
is
also
a
significant
example
of
a
successful
leveraging
of
power
against
a
wealthy
,
corporate
body
.
As
previous
coverage
has
mentioned
,
there
are
a
few
considerations
to
bear
in
mind
in
the
midst
of
celebration
.
While
this
decision
strides
toward
righting
a
historic
inequity
between
student
athletes
and
the
NCAA
,
it
leaves
in
place
structural
inequities
that
permeate
college
sports
writ
large
.
For
a
particularly
stark
example
,
one
needs
to
go
no
further
than
the
hallowed
grounds
of
K
Ville
.
Which
basketball
games
do
we
huddle
in
tents
for
and
which
do
we
often
neglect
to
burn
benches
after
or
to
celebrate
altogether
?
Put
another
way
,
which
student
athletes
stand
to
profit
the
most
off
their
labor
under
the
new
rules
?
Female
and
male
student
athletes
perform
similar
athletic
labor
,
but
the
difference
between
the
money
,
fans
and
press
coverage
could
not
be
more
stark
.
Duke’s
overall
r
ecruiting
expenses
for
men
and
women
are
2
1
.
The
total
overall
expenses
including
promotional
activities
,
equipment
,
recruiting
,
etc
.
for
men’s
and
women’s
teams
are
calculated
to
be
59
,
449
,
281
and
24
,
539
,
320
respectively
.
This
disparity
also
follows
female
athletes
into
the
professional
leagues
.
Zion
Williamson
is
slated
to
make
close
to
10
million
in
his
opening
season
with
the
Pelicans
,
while
the
most
a
WNBA
player
made
in
2019
was
127
,
500
.
In
fact
,
in
that
same
year
not
a
single
female
athlete
made
it
onto
Forbes’
list
of
the
100
best
paid
athletes
in
the
world
.
This
is
true
even
in
sports
where
female
teams
far
outstrip
male
teams
in
viewership
and
ratings
,
as
the
United
States
Women’s
National
Soccer
Team
has
shown
through
their
class
action
discrimination
suit
.
Looking
beyond
gender
,
Black
Bodies
,
White
Entertainment
,
a
recent
panel
hosted
by
The
Center
for
Race
Relations
,
highlighted
the
intense
racialization
of
college
sports
.
Take
the
Power
Five
conferences
for
example
.
Black
men
make
up
2
.
4
of
the
undergraduate
student
population
on
these
65
campuses
;
yet
,
they
make
up
56
of
the
basketball
teams
.
Furthermore
,
79
of
the
head
coaches
for
these
teams
are
white
and
rake
in
on
average
2
.
7
million
annually
.
The
Black
athletes
represented
by
these
statistics
have
expressed
feelings
of
exploitation
,
likening
college
sports
to
slavery
given
the
use
of
predominantly
Black
labor
for
the
profit
of
white
coaches
and
executives
.
At
the
very
least
,
there
is
a
clear
dynamic
established
at
these
predominantly
white
institutions
PWIs
,
like
Duke
,
that
cast
Black
students
as
athletes
and
entertainers
before
all
else
.
This
has
led
some
to
call
for
Black
athletes
to
leave
PWIs
in
favor
of
historically
Black
colleges
and
universities
HBCUs
.
Importantly
,
neither
this
proposal
nor
the
NCAA
decision
require
any
from
PWIs
in
terms
of
institutional
equity
.
The
opportunity
for
athletes
to
earn
some
monetary
rewards
of
their
own
is
a
step
,
but
it
cannot
be
the
end
.
Wins
like
these
demonstrate
the
worthwhile
material
payoff
of
placing
pressure
on
institutional
bodies
and
such
victories
ought
to
be
celebrated
as
they
come
.
Certainly
,
it’s
unclear
whether
this
will
alleviate
or
intensify
the
gender
pay
gap
or
the
racialized
nature
of
athletics
,
but
at
least
the
NCAA
has
taken
one
concrete
step
forward
by
removing
the
firewall
between
college
athletes
and
money
They've
decided
that
they're
willing
to
play
ball
.
Devoted
reader
,
Thank
you
for
your
query
.
This
presents
an
interesting
question
if
you’re
willing
to
pay
the
prescribed
penalty
,
is
it
ethical
to
break
rules
?
Suppose
your
time
stamped
Chem
101
lab
is
due
in
the
department
dropbox
at
1
30
PM
.
Because
you
were
bingeing
on
Netflix
,
you
finish
the
assignment
at
1
PM
,
putting
yourself
under
tremendous
time
pressure
.
By
the
time
you
unlock
your
ride
at
the
closest
Spin
scooter
,
you
have
only
minutes
to
get
to
Science
Drive
.
It’s
time
to
break
some
rules
!
The
first
corner
you
cut
is
ditching
the
helmet
.
A
pair
of
Ray
Ban
sunglasses
and
fingerless
leather
gloves
better
suit
your
mood
.
And
to
get
your
legs
pumping
and
quell
your
stress
,
a
SoundCloud
remix
flowing
from
your
AirPods
is
an
obvious
necessity
.
As
you
zoom
past
the
C1
in
a
public
display
of
dominance
,
you
come
to
a
horrifying
realization
.
Being
the
smart
Dukie
that
you
are
,
you’ve
done
the
math
taking
the
legal
path
up
Towerview
Road
at
a
max
speed
of
16
MPH
just
won’t
cut
it
.
In
a
panic
,
you
make
the
executive
decision
to
sport
your
vehicle
straight
through
the
BC
plaza
.
Your
classmates
,
who
are
enjoying
the
lazy
warm
weather
,
look
up
in
astonishment
.
But
to
hell
with
what
others
think
when
your
already
mediocre
GPA
is
on
the
line
!
Reaching
your
destination
,
you
execute
a
smooth
dismount
that
one
might
label
a
stop
,
drop
,
and
roll
.
In
a
clatter
of
metal
meets
pavement
,
the
scooter
is
strewn
to
the
side
.
Hopefully
the
atrocious
parking
job
will
deter
anyone
from
taking
it
.
That’s
just
an
added
bonus
.
With
30
seconds
to
go
,
you
run
down
the
steps
and
find
yourself
on
a
collision
course
with
a
fellow
tardy
classmate
.
Only
one
of
you
can
make
it
on
time
.
Your
conscience
says
yield
,
but
the
concept
of
relative
success
voids
that
more
charitable
impulse
.
Grades
are
determined
on
a
curve
,
and
the
perverse
implication
is
that
someone
else’s
failure
can
enhance
your
chances
of
success
.
A
simple
clip
of
the
heel
will
send
her
spinning
and
sprawling
.
Good
heavens
,
did
I
do
that
?
I’m
such
a
clutz
!
you
call
to
her
over
your
shoulder
.
I
put
it
to
you
,
devoted
reader
which
of
the
transgressions
above
,
if
any
,
is
within
the
bounds
of
acceptable
behavior
?
Surely
,
riding
the
scooter
without
a
helmet
can’t
be
labeled
unethical
.
Most
students
enjoy
the
cool
breeze
flowing
through
their
hair
,
even
on
a
leisurely
ride
.
Wearing
AirPods
is
slightly
more
problematic
because
they
might
cancel
out
the
sound
of
a
bus
full
of
students
coming
up
behind
you
.
Not
only
are
you
endangering
yourself
,
but
you
are
endangering
every
person
on
the
bus
.
There
is
no
justification
for
that
,
other
than
your
selfish
desire
to
enjoy
some
tunes
.
What
about
riding
an
electric
scooter
down
the
BC
plaza
?
Most
would
agree
that
this
is
a
more
egregious
infraction
,
beyond
the
commonly
accepted
code
of
conduct
.
It
puts
pedestrians
in
harm’s
way
and
demonstrates
flagrant
disregard
for
the
law
.
Even
though
there
is
a
practical
goal
getting
the
paper
submitted
on
time
the
ends
do
not
justify
the
means
.

There
is
no
bright
line
of
when
breaking
the
rules
becomes
unethical
.
Most
people
are
willing
to
give
you
a
pass
for
a
heat
of
the
moment
,
one
time
violation
of
certain
rules
.
Particularly
if
the
rule
is
minor
,
which
of
course
is
often
subjective
.
But
while
there
are
certain
rules
that
may
be
okay
to
break
under
certain
circumstances
,
there
are
some
that
should
never
be
broken
at
all
.
What
about
deliberately
striking
a
fellow
student
?
Of
course
,
there
are
a
million
ways
to
justify
it
to
yourself
.
Such
as
,
she
is
really
annoying
.
Or
she
is
doing
better
than
I
am
in
Chem
101
.
Or
I
can
shave
another
2
seconds
off
the
race
to
the
chemistry
building
if
I
ride
my
Spin
scooter
through
her
,
instead
of
around
her
.
As
tempting
as
those
excuses
may
be
,
they’re
all
obviously
beyond
the
pale
.
In
the
end
,
a
willingness
to
pay
the
prescribed
penalty
does
not
excuse
outrageous
violations
of
rule
and
law
.
Sure
,
you
may
be
willing
to
risk
a
lawsuit
for
causing
the
C1
to
crash
,
but
that
doesn’t
make
it
alright
to
wear
earbuds
.
And
a
willingness
to
be
forever
banned
from
the
BC
plaza
does
not
make
it
okay
to
ride
your
scooter
along
it
in
the
first
place
.
Ethics
cannot
be
bought
.
I
was
pleased
,
though
saddened
,
to
see
the
report
of
the
failure
of
my
alma
mater
,
The
Divinity
School
of
Duke
University
,
to
address
adequately
the
continuing
discrimination
within
The
United
Methodist
Church
regarding
people
who
are
LGBTQ
.
nbsp
;
This
discrimination
,
which
I
will
call
institutional
bigotry
,
prevents
people
who
are
LGBTQ
from
being
ordained
in
ministry
in
The
UMC
,
further
preventing
clergy
from
conducting
a
same
sex
marriage
and
holding
same
sex
marriages
in
UM
church
facilities
.
nbsp
;
At
this
point
,
United
Methodist
Church
law
is
discriminatory
,
biblically
unfounded
,
theologically
bankrupt
,
and
separated
from
the
ways
of
God
.
For
my
friend
Dean
Greg
Jones
to
issue
his
February
statement
without
a
clear
call
from
The
Divinity
School
of
Duke
University
to
The
UMC
to
end
this
discrimination
is
most
unfortunate
.
nbsp
;
To
say
that
gay
students
are
welcome
and
are
to
be
supported
without
calling
for
a
clear
path
for
them
to
be
ordained
as
they
are
called
by
God
to
serve
as
pastors
is
to
say
We
will
take
your
money
and
offer
education
but
we
will
give
voice
to
opening
the
path
for
you
to
use
the
education
for
which
you
paid
.
nbsp
;
Would
it
not
be
more
honest
to
say
,
Don’t
enroll
here
;
the
door
is
not
open
for
you
to
pursue
your
calling
.
The
stance
of
The
Divinity
School
appears
to
be
at
odds
with
the
principles
and
values
of
the
larger
institution
of
Duke
University
.
Further
,
there
is
the
appearance
in
the
Dean’s
statement
that
general
United
Methodist
financial
support
takes
precedence
over
righteousness
.
Dean
Jones
nbsp
;
I
expect
much
more
from
you
and
from
The
Divinity
School
than
this
.
nbsp
;
Please
amend
your
statement
by
calling
for
an
end
to
our
United
Methodist
institutional
discrimination
as
contained
in
United
Methodist
Church
law
.
In
December
of
2016
,
the
House
of
Representatives’
Education
and
Labor
Committee
published
an
article
which
explains
Betsy
DeVos’
direct
connection
to
the
convenience
water
company
,
Boxed
Water
is
Better
.
However
,
this
knowledge
apparently
did
not
go
very
far
,
as
since
2016
,
the
company
has
continued
to
grow
,
and
its
distribution
sales
more
than
doubled
in
2013
.
This
fall
semester
2019
,
Boxed
Water
is
Better
had
even
made
its
way
onto
Duke’s
campus
at
Saladelia
locations
.
DeVos
is
the
chairwoman
of
the
Windquest
Group
,
an
investment
management
firm
which
claims
to
invest
in
people
who
care
and
aim
to
make
our
world
a
better
place
,
but
is
arguably
just
a
for
profit
organization
using
a
greenwashing
technique
to
make
consumers
think
that
they
care
about
the
environment
.
Fortunately
,
Boxed
Water
is
Better
was
only
on
campus
for
a
few
weeks
,
and
will
no
longer
be
sold
at
Saladelia
locations
.
Jared
Jonsdotter
,
who
works
in
Vondy
,
told
me
that
they
aren't
selling
boxed
water
anymore
because
they
saw
a
30
decrease
in
sales
.
We
don't
know
exactly
whether
Saladelia
stopped
using
boxed
water
only
because
of
this
drop
in
sales
,
or
because
Saladelia
realized
that
Betsy
Devos
owns
Boxed
Water
is
Better
.
Perhaps
sales
decreased
because
Duke
students
opposed
Boxed
Water
for
ethical
reasons
,
or
maybe
they
simply
did
not
like
the
taste
.
Either
way
,
boxed
water
is
out
.
We
need
to
continue
to
be
aware
of
the
brands
that
we
give
money
to
,
to
be
conscious
consumers
.
Don’t
fall
for
the
re
branding
attempt
to
brainwash
you
.
Boxed
water
isn't
better
,
it
is
just
rebranded
water
.
Vaping
isn't
better
than
smoking
,
Juul
just
rebranded
it
.
Boxed
Water
is
just
one
of
the
companies
that
is
part
of
the
Windquest
Group
,
an
investment
group
owned
by
Dick
amp
;
Betsy
DeVos
.
And
there’s
really
no
doubt
that
she
is
part
of
this
company
,
since
the
image
on
Betsy
DeVos’s
Twitter
banner
contained
product
placement
of
Boxed
Water
,
until
it
was
eventually
taken
down
due
to
conflict
of
interest
issues
.
The
biggest
irony
of
the
DeVos
Family
owning
Boxed
Water
is
Better
is
that
they
are
major
contributors
to
Governor
Rick
Snyder
of
Michigan
,
and
other
state
politicians
who
support
policies
which
grant
Nestle
Corporation
the
right
to
continue
stealing
water
from
Michigan
municipality
sources
for
their
Ice
Mountain
bottled
water
brand
.
This
kind
of
action
perpetuates
water
crises
,
such
as
the
one
seen
in
Flint
,
Michigan
.
The
cool
,
slim
look
of
Boxed
Water
is
Better’s
packaging
is
a
marketing
scheme
,
and
while
its
purported
environmental
agenda
is
something
I
can
support
,
there
is
little
evidence
of
Boxed
Water’s
commitment
to
these
actions
.
The
water
does
ship
better
,
and
cardboard
is
certainly
more
compostable
than
plastic
,
so
using
cardboard
to
store
water
may
reduce
waste
,
but
the
Devos
family
and
their
political
constituents
are
clearly
using
profits
from
this
water
company
in
their
agenda
to
privatize
publicly
owned
resources
,
such
as
fresh
water
,
and
downsize
functions
of
local
government
.
In
Detroit
,
the
Devos
family
gives
political
and
monetary
support
to
an
Emergency
Management
System
,
which
,
since
2000
,
has
continued
to
outsource
the
state’s
water
services
to
private
companies
,
and
effectively
shut
off
water
to
thousands
of
homes
in
low
income
communities
.
In
February
2016
,
Boxed
Water
is
Better
released
a
statement
saying
they
were
going
to
donate
11
,
520
units
to
help
the
Flint
water
crisis
,
which
is
a
tiny
drop
of
water
in
the
ocean
needed
to
provide
water
for
the
city
.
This
amount
of
aid
,
which
Boxed
Water
did
not
even
follow
up
on
,
did
not
seek
to
help
the
Flint
water
crisis
;
rather
,
it
was
another
selfish
marketing
campaign
;
Boxed
Water
Is
Better
used
the
Flint
water
crisis
to
promote
sales
of
their
convenience
water
product
.
In
2017
,
convenience
water
industry
sales
reached
16
billion
,
up
ten
percent
as
concern
over
the
safety
of
tap
water
rose
after
high
profile
contamination
in
Flint
,
Michigan
.
Americans
continue
to
drink
bottled
water
for
fear
of
what
contaminants
found
in
tap
water
.
However
,
bottled
water
isn’t
necessarily
more
pure
than
tap
.
Convenience
water
companies
continue
to
make
a
profit
,
without
even
being
legally
required
to
disclose
their
water
contamination
reports
,
for
a
good
that
should
be
universally
available
.
We
need
more
water
regulation
,
a
move
towards
improving
public
water
filtration
systems
,
and
away
from
giving
money
to
these
corporations
which
pull
safe
water
from
low
income
communities
,
and
advance
a
policy
agenda
which
allows
them
to
continue
to
do
it
.
What’s
really
better
,
and
perhaps
the
only
environmentally
conscious
way
to
consume
water
,
is
to
drink
out
of
a
reusable
water
bottle
.
Everyone
should
have
one
by
now
,
and
honestly
if
you
need
one
,
here's
the
secret
hit
up
any
Duke
lost
and
found
,
and
you’ll
find
dozens
of
options
.
I
found
a
Hydroflask
in
lost
and
found
my
sophomore
year
and
have
been
using
it
ever
since
.
Soap
,
hot
water
and
a
bit
of
elbow
grease
later
and
you're
one
step
closer
to
avoiding
the
convenience
water
market
altogether
.
Now
all
you
have
to
do
is
fill
it
up
.
As
far
as
I
can
tell
,
everyone’s
favorite
water
is
the
fruit
infused
water
in
the
Broadhead
center
we
affectionately
call
woooo
water
.
Next
,
those
fancy
water
fountains
that
you
find
in
airports
they’re
everywhere
now

Municipal
water
should
be
better
taken
care
of
and
should
use
these
high
tech
water
filtration
systems
used
by
the
convenience
water
companies
,
and
thus
,
the
market
for
convenience
water
should
be
erased
.
Everyone
should
have
access
to
free

As
an
alum
who
graduated
in
2009
,
a
recent
Chronicle
article
by
sophomore
Christian
Sheerer
entitled
nbsp
;
How
Duke
Breeds
Devils
caught
my
attention
.
While
I
disagree
with
the
darkness
of
the
title
,
the
thoughtful
analysis
and
determined
call
for
better
action
impressed
me
.
Since
I've
already
experienced
this
same
disillusionment
,
I
would
like
to
offer
encouragement
to
those
who
are
struggling
to
see
enough
light
on
the
other
side
of
graduation
.
Unlike
most
people
at
Duke
,
I
coasted
through
high
school
without
much
of
an
exciting
future
to
look
forward
to
.
My
parents
immigrated
from
Taipei
with
only
20
and
severe
condescension
from
my
dad's
remaining
sisters
,
and
,
three
days
before
starting
8th
grade
,
I
was
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
uprooted
from
my
education
oriented
hometown
in
Northwest
Arkansas
and
transplanted
to
a
Texan
town
known
primarily
for
crazy
cults
and
a
particularly
infamous
siege
that
generated
significantly
less
glory
than
the
one
at
the
Alamo
.
At
church
,
the
youth
pastor
frequently
invited
his
favorites
to
hangouts
and
sleepovers
at
his
house
and
ignored
7th
graders
who
were
struggling
to
fit
in
at
school
.
Then
a
basketball
player
at
the
local
Christian
university
murdered
a
teammate
,
and
the
head
coach
tried
to
cover
it
up
.
Needless
to
say
,
mentorship
and
role
models
were
in
short
supply
throughout
my
life
,
and
I
felt
that
life
was
just
a
series
of
nothing
.
By
my
senior
year
of
high
school
,
I
had
vague
notions
of
going
to
college
because
I
could
effortlessly
ace
all
my
classes
despite
skipping
or
sleeping
through
everything
other
than
basketball
,
soccer
and
track
.
All
these
schools
had
been
sending
endless
recruiting
pamphlets
bragging
about
how
they
were
academically
and
athletically
elite
,
but
a
lazy
scan
through
the
rankings
on
US
News
and
ESPN's
rankings
quickly
disproved
most
of
their
claims
.
However
,
one
name
caught
my
attention
Duke
.
As
a
shooting
guard
,
I
was
already
in
awe
of
JJ
Redick
and
Coach
K
,
but
I
learned
more
through
the
pamphlets
that
occasionally
arrived
in
our
mailbox
.
When
I
skimmed
the
Duke
one
,
I
saw
that
the
pamphlet
mostly
talked
about
what
it
meant
to
be
a
Blue
Devil
.
School
.
Basketball
.
Community
.
Krzyzewskiville
.
Volunteers
.
Uganda
.
Wait
.
.
.
Uganda
?
While
camping
out
in
Krzyzewskiville
,
students
had
organized
trips
to
dig
wells
and
provide
clean
drinking
water
in
Uganda
.
Duke
had
all
this
stuff
to
brag
about
,
and
instead
,
they
want
to
tell
me
about
what
the
students
were
doing
?
In
fact
,
just
a
couple
weeks
ago
,
juniors
Sam
Chan
and
Vicki
Lu
led
the
HackDuke
team
in
unanimously
rejecting
a
major
sponsorship
from
Palantir
despite
knowing
there
was
no
time
left
to
raise
sorely
needed
money
and
cover
the
shortfall
for
hosting
500
participants
this
past
weekend
from
all
over
the
United
States
.
The
commitment
and
empathy
they
showed
in
committing
HackDuke's
theme
Code
For
Good
is
something
that
Blue
Devils
are
proud
to
uphold
,
even
after
graduation
.
The
various
alumni
communities
I've
been
involved
with
all
volunteer
in
their
local
communities
.
In
October
,
Duke
North
Texas
helped
Paul
Quinn
College
,
an
HBCU
that
came
back
from
financial
ruin
under
the
tenure
of
a
Duke
alum
,
with
preparing
its
on
campus
farm
to
serve
a
federally
recognized
food
desert
.
This
coming
weekend
,
alums
in
Palo
Alto
will
volunteer
at
a
Goodwill
to
provide
counseling
and
job
placement
services
to
young
adults
.
All
across
the
world
,
many
of
us
are
currently
interviewing
applicants
to
help
form
the
Class
of
2024
and
doing
our
best
to
help
you
find
a
better
path
into
a
brighter
world
when
you
graduate
.
What
we
saw
in
each
other
as
classmates
and
continue
to
see
in
each
other
as
alums
,
as
well
as
you
students
,
is
what
we
look
for
in
these
hopeful
applicants
.
Duke
isn't
perfect
,
and
,
just
like
any
other
place
in
the
world
,
will
inevitably
breed
devils
.
Christian
is
right
in
pointing
out
that
unfortunate
fact
in
his
article
.
Keep
calling
out
and
protesting
against
injustices
.
Keep
creating
opportunities
for
those
less
fortunate
than
ourselves
.
As
long
as
we
all
continue
doing
that
,
I
know
that
what
I
first
read
about
in
2004
will
hold
strong
into
the
future
.
As
worn
out
as
you
may
be
with
midterms
and
navigating
the
real
world
,
I
hope
that
all
of
you
will
feel
encouraged
when
you
look
around
at
yourselves
,
your
own
classmates
and
even
us
alums
.
After
all
,
Duke
also
breeds
Blue
Devils
.
I
opened
my
phone
and
go
through
Instagram
on
the
bus
to
my
8
30
Chemistry
lecture
in
Gross
Hall
.
I
catch
up
with
some
friends
before
finally
stumbling
upon
the
Duke
Men’s
Basketball
Instagram
.
Upon
viewing
their
story
,
I
find
that
they
have
been
working
through
drills
since
early
in
the
morning
.
Returning
to
their
page
later
in
the
day
confirms
that
they
have
been
practicing
,
performing
strength
training
,
and
much
more
.
Even
though
I
am
only
a
first
semester
freshman
,
I
find
it
hard
to
imagine
an
entire
schedule
of
courses
combined
with
the
load
of
an
athletic
team
.
Upon
a
deeper
investigation
into
the
culture
of
sports
teams
,
I
find
that
integrity
is
the
backbone
that
holds
them
together
.
Integrity
is
usually
associated
with
academics
.
From
adhering
to
the
Duke
Community
Standard
to
following
course
policies
,
Duke
students
hear
about
integrity
and
equate
it
to
an
academic
definition
.
However
,
you’ll
find
that
Duke
Athletics
values
integrity
as
one
of
their
fundamental
pillars
.
At
the
Honor
Council
event
in
October
,
Coach
P
Integrity
and
Sports
,
our
Women’s
Basketball
Coach
Joanne
P
.
McCallie
discussed
how
she
looks
for
strong
character
qualities
in
her
players
and
recruits
.
You
don’t
just
want
the
best
player
on
your
team
,
you
want
to
find
a
player
that
is
going
to
have
the
highest
ceiling
.
The
most
important
player
on
the
team
is
not
the
best
but
the
individual
that
can
help
the
team
grow
the
most
,
and
often
,
integrity
is
the
highlighting
quality
of
this
individual
.
Even
though
we
are
not
all
Division
I
Athletes
,
we
have
all
been
in
group
projects
.
Whether
it
is
a
group
project
or
an
athletic
team
,
the
fundamental
components
of
the
group
are
the
same
.
There
are
traditional
group
roles
such
as
a
Captain
or
Group
Leader
;
however
,
there
are
also
individuals
termed
Hitchhikers
and
Couch
Potatoes
.
Hitchhikers
count
on
you
to
act
in
a
self
sacrificing
manner
,
while
Couch
Potatoes
are
individuals
who
perform
the
facade
of
contributing
to
the
group
,
but
in
reality
,
they
are
there
just
for
the
show
.
These
individuals
bring
down
the
efficiency
of
the
group
,
so
eliminating
these
qualities
are
imperative
for
the
success
of
the
collective
group
.
Many
of
the
students
at
Duke
were
Group
Leaders
at
their
high
schools
,
so
when
they
arrived
on
campus
,
they
were
looking
forward
to
working
in
an
environment
where
contributions
are
equally
split
.
Theoretically
,
groups
at
Duke
should
function
at
peak
efficiency
;
however
,
that
is
not
the
case
.
At
Duke
,
some
students
are
beginning
to
exhibit
Coach
Potato
and
Hitchhiker
qualities
.
So
what
is
happening
to
these
former
leaders
?
In
our
Duke
Community
,
students
find
themselves
surrounded
by
a
community
of
driven
scholars
.
In
high
school
,
we
were
all
the
top
dog
.
However
,
Duke
forces
to
face
the
reality
that
this
is
no
longer
the
case
.
As
a
result
,
students
adjust
and
assign
themselves
as
intellectually
superior
or
inferior
.
This
mindset
is
destructive
to
the
Duke
Community
because
students
block
themselves
out
of
the
growth
mindset
.
To
fight
this
mentality
,
we
have
to
develop
the
understanding
that
even
if
we
are
not
the
star
player
,
we
are
still
on
the
team
,
and
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
team
,
we
should
strive
to
contribute
the
most
.
In
the
spirit
of
The
New
York
Times’
Modern
Love
section
and
Recess’
bite
size
love
stories
column
,
I
asked
Duke
students
and
alumni
to
submit
Tiny
Love
Stories
told
in
100
words
or
less
.
Let’s
face
it
,
attending
Duke
University
can
be
stressful
,
lonely
,
and
a
whole
lot
of
gloomy
adjectives
personified
by
the
frigid
week
we’ve
been
having
ignore
my
column’s
title
in
this
case
please
bundle
up
.
Likely
,
some
of
us
are
feeling
the
pressures
of
Duke
right
now
,
and
some
of
us
are
being
bucked
by
it
.
Hang
in
there
and
stop
reading
The
Chronicle
.
But
for
most
of
us
,
the
social
,
personal
,
and
academic
fatigues
of
Duke
are
a
bit
more
chronic
.
They
twist
and
knot
themselves
into
our
psyches
,
our
conversations
,
and
most
egregiously
,
our
thoracic
spines
.
That’s
right
,
we
are
going
through
a
spinal
health
crisis
,
and
I
think
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
oversized
,
Santa
approved
sacks
we
haul
around
better
known
as
backpacks
.
A
sturdy
backpack
,
defined
by
me
as
a
receptacle
with
two
straps
and
zero
remorse
,
is
essential
for
any
Duke
student
who
wants
to
freely
use
their
hands
.
There
are
a
few
of
us
who
do
get
by
slinging
handbags
and
computer
sleeves
,
but
for
the
majority
of
students
,
our
nomadic
lifestyles
require
us
to
employ
the
services
of
High
Sierra
,
North
Face
,
and
Jansport
to
carry
our
stuff
.
And
if
you’re
anything
like
me
,
we
treat
our
backpacks
as
if
they
are
the
suitcases
our
parents
pack
for
vacations
.
They’re
overweight
and
filled
with
things
we
don’t
need
.
The
only
time
mine
has
been
empty
was
when
I
first
bought
it
from
Staples
back
in
August
.
Since
then
,
it’s
been
abused
by
my
indecision
,
reaching
a
critical
mass
of
things
even
Atlas
would
get
tired
of
carrying
.
But
for
the
past
few
months
,
I
convinced
myself
I
could
accomplish
the
Herculean
task
of
lugging
the
equivalent
of
a
small
child
around
with
me
.
As
my
frequent
back
pain
can
attest
,
this
was
not
a
good
idea
.
I
realized
my
backpack
was
too
heavy
when
I
offered
my
English
professor
,
whose
Olympic
stamina
is
routinely
displayed
by
his
impressive
lectures
,
to
lift
my
bag
.
If
there
was
anyone
who
could
determine
if
my
bag
was
too
heavy
,
it
was
Professor
Strandberg
.
Holy
!
He
remarked
,
dropping
my
backpack
to
the
ground
with
a
loud
thud
.
There
was
my
answer
.
That
was
the
day
I
stopped
carrying
with
me
all
the
time
.
Turns
out
,
the
book
isn’t
very
portable
.
Nor
was
the
calculator
I
kept
in
the
side
pocket
of
my
bag
,
or
the
emergency
Moleskin
I
stashed
in
the
back
,
or
the
book
I
stole
from
West
Union
,
or
the
obscene
amount
of
highlighters
,
pens
,
and
textbooks
I
hoarded
in
preparation
for
the
academic
apocalypse
that
never
arrived
.

Across
college
campuses
,
overloaded
backpacks
are
a
real
health
concern
.
Around
85
percent
of
American
university
students
in
2008
reported
backpack
related
pain
and
discomfort
.
A
backpack
that
is
too
heavy
causes
imbalance
and
muscle
strain
,
distorting
the
natural
curvature
of
the
spine
.
Combine
this
with
the
time
we
spend
slouched
over
desks
and
computer
screens
and
and
a
lot
of
us
will
end
up
with
60
year
old
problems
in
18
year
old
bodies
.
Don’t
let
that
be
you
.
Take
caution
in
what
you
carry
.
Experts
recommend
that
students
carry
no
more
than
10
percent
of
their
weight
in
a
backpack
.
It’s
good
,
practical
advice
,
and
if
you
follow
it
,
you
just
might
make
it
to
the
end
of
the
semester
.
But
as
we
all
obediently
empty
our
bags
as
we
should
,
now
is
an
opportune
time
to
consider
the
other
weights
of
our
lives
.
Ten
percent
is
also
the
subject
of
the
advice
President
Price
gives
to
Duke
students
.
He
recommends
that
every
Duke
student
cut
back
on
10
percent
of
whatever
they’re
doing
,
whether
it’s
a
club
,
a
commitment
,
or
the
bustle
of
Duke
culture
that
leaves
us
wondering
if
we
should
be
doing
more
.
Our
time
at
Duke
,
like
an
unfilled
backpack
,
is
ripe
with
possibility
.
There
are
so
many
things
to
do
,
people
to
meet
,
and
socials
and
talks
and
shows
to
attend
that
it
seems
the
only
way
to
do
everything
is
to
overwhelm
ourselves
.
But
soon
we
find
ourselves
cramming
things
into
pockets
of
time
even
if
they
don’t
fit
or
belong
.
We
overload
,
adding
that
extra
class
or
that
extra
club
and
we
overthink
.
Like
a
good
backpack
,
however
,
our
time
at
Duke
can
carry
a
lot
of
things
,
but
it
can’t
make
room
for
everything
.
But
it’s
the
limitation
of
experience
that
makes
a
Duke
education
truly
valuable
.
So
lighten
your
load
.
Muster
the
introspection
to
do
less
and
instead
commit
to
the
organizations
,
issues
,
and
people
that
really
matter
in
your
life
.
And
please
,
give
your
back
a
break
.
The
best
therapist
I've
ever
had
is
one
I
still
look
up
to
.
I
suppose
I'm
pretty
lucky
to
have
had
such
a
positive
experience
starting
out
in
therapy
.
However
,
I
always
wondered
how
my
therapist
was
so
effective
in
impacting
the
way
I
view
myself
and
the
world
.
Truthfully
,
I
often
didn’t
even
know
what
to
expect
when
I
would
step
into
his
office
for
our
hour
long
appointments
.
I
was
always
pleasantly
surprised
after
I
left
,
but
one
would
think
a
sort
of
structure
would
aid
in
a
coherent
bond
between
the
client
therapist
relationship
And
perhaps
that's
not
necessarily
true
.
The
freedom
of
being
able
to
share
my
thoughts
and
feelings
with
Dr
.
R
without
the
need
for
rigid
walls
between
us
felt
absolutely
liberating
.
The
rigidity
that
comes
with
fierce
note
taking
or
a
callous
reading
of
symptoms
.
There
was
none
of
that
.
I
felt
like
way
more
than
a
checklist
of
symptoms
.
I
felt
.
I
talk
about
my
feelings
.
I
have
spent
most
of
2019
coming
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
chronic
pain
will
be
a
part
of
my
life
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
and
that
process
has
often
looked
a
lot
like
grief
.
Anyone
who
has
experienced
grief
knows
that
it’s
exhausting
.
Anyone
whose
body
hurts
all
the
time
knows
that
chronic
pain
is
exhausting
.
And
anyone
who
has
been
at
Duke
for
four
years
knows
that
Duke
is
exhausting
.
I’m
proud
of
the
work
I’ve
done
this
year
,
grieving
a
future
I
wish
looked
different
,
while
also
doing
all
that
I
need
to
do
to
be
a
senior
at
Duke
.
But
I
don’t
have
the
energy
right
now
to
do
even
what
I
do
best
.
So
instead
of
talking
about
my
feelings
this
week
,
I’d
like
to
share
one
of
the
things
that
helps
me
process
those
feelings
an
impeccable
,
annotated
,
playlist
.
Like
the
snacks
I
mentioned
briefly
in
my
previous
column
,
music
does
not
cure
chronic
pain
;
nothing
does
.
But
it
certainly
helps
.
And
sure
,
my
music
taste
is
a
deeply
niche
cross
between
that
of
a
40
year
old
mom
who
really
liked
Glee
and
wishes
she
pursued
theater
after
high
school
and
a
white
hipster
mandolin
player
who
voted
for
Bernie
in
2016
but
was
into
her
Christian
youth
group
in
high
school
.
These
songs
resonate
with
a
very
particular
person
,
and
that
person
is
me
.
I
hope
you
enjoy
these
selections
and
my
longer
playlist
anyway
,
but
more
importantly
,
I
hope
you
create
your
own
playlist
,
full
of
your
own
weird
music
,
for
the
days
you
want
to
sing
about
your
feelings
instead
of
talk
about
them
,
too
.
Durham
City
Council
candidate
Joshua
Gunn
is
not
opposed
to
the
Affordable
Housing
Bond
but
he
has
some
concerns
.
And
you
should
too
.
Gunn
is
a
fourth
generation
Durhamite
whose
ancestors
came
to
Durham
following
emancipation
,
in
search
of
the
economic
opportunity
the
city
claimed
to
afford
to
all
people
.
Today
,
Gunn’s
career
as
a
rapper
or
his
role
on
the
BET
reality
series
may
not
make
him
an
obvious
choice
for
Durham’s
City
Council
,
but
his
commitment
to
bettering
the
city
is
clear
.
Not
only
is
he
vice
president
of
the
Greater
Durham
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
but
he
is
also
on
the
boards
of
the
Durham
Public
Schools
Foundation
,
the
North
Carolina
Center
for
Nonprofits
,
and
the
Museum
of
Durham
History
.
His
role
in
the
community
earned
him
support
from
the
Durham
Committee
on
the
Affairs
of
Black
People
,
the
Friends
of
Durham
,
the
local
chapter
of
the
Fraternal
Order
of
Police
,
former
city
council
member
Cora
Cole
McFadden
,
and
current
council
member
Mark
Anthony
Middleton
.
In
this
week’s
election
,
Gunn
will
challenge
three
incumbents
,
but
he
is
starting
by
challenging
their
ardent
support
for
the
affordable
housing
bond
.
The
95
million
affordable
housing
bond
will
appear
on
the
ballot
in
Durham’s
election
on
November
5
.
Durham
Mayor
Steve
Schewel
called
for
the
increase
in
funding
in
his
State
of
the
City
address
last
February
.
Currently
,
the
Durham
Housing
Authority
DHA
does
not
have
the
funding
to
create
affordable
housing
for
low
income
people
in
downtown
,
who
are
primarily
people
of
color
,
Schewel
said
.
The
city
of
Durham’s
website
claims
that
the
95
million
bond
would
construct
1
,
600
new
affordable
housing
units
;
provide
housing
for
1
,
700
households
experiencing
homelessness
;
create
affordable
home
ownership
opportunities
for
400
first
time
homebuyers
;
allow
3
,
000
low
income
renters
and
homeowners
to
remain
in
or
improve
their
homes
;
and
bring
thousands
of
new
jobs
to
the
city
.
The
promises
advertised
are
hard
to
oppose
.
Gunn
agrees
that
the
crisis
of
low
income
housing
is
real
,
but
the
city
of
Durham
has
a
history
of
failed
promises
to
its
most
vulnerable
population
;
black
and
brown
folks
.
Gunn’s
family
was
one
of
the
many
that
has
felt
the
devastation
of
similar
bonds
in
the
past
.
In
1960
,
a
wave
of
urban
renewal
projects
swept
the
nation
and
Durham
was
no
exception
.
The
city’s
ballot
that
year
featured
a
bond
that
promised
many
benefits
to
low
income
communities
of
color
,
similar
to
those
listed
today
.
Residents
of
Durham’s
historic
African
American
community
Hayti
were
promised
that
they
would
return
to
a
better
place
to
live
and
work
,
once
the
redevelopment
project
finished
.
Additionally
,
residents
were
promised
financial
help
by
the
Redevelopment
Commission
as
well
as
assistance
in
finding
a
suitable
,
standard
relocation
facility
.
Unfortunately
,
most
of
the
residents
who
once
occupied
Black
Wall
Street
did
not
return
.
Those
who
did
found
Pettigrew
and
Fayetteville
Streets
lined
with
dilapidated
structures
where
their
once
thriving
businesses
once
stood
.
The
general
leadership
,
local
management
,
unforeseen
side
effects
,
and
racial
bias
were
blamed
but
no
one
was
e
held
accountable
.
Durham
did
not
learn
from
its
mistake
.
In
2000
,
DHA
announced
a
new
solution
to
Few
Gardens
,
a
public
housing
site
that
Gunn
remembers
as
being
one
of
the
most
dangerous
neighborhoods
in
Durham
.
Even
just
sitting
on
the
school
bus
I
was
scared
,
Gunn
recalls
.
DHA
claimed
that
with
a
HOPE
VI
grant
of
35
,
000
,
000
and
an
additional
120
,
000
,
000
from
public
and
private
sources
,
the
city
could
revitalize
Few
Gardens
and
strengthen
the
surrounding
community
.
The
new
housing
will
be
well
designed
and
will
include
a
range
of
rental
housing
and
homeownership
opportunities
,
the
city
stated
.
Again
,
the
low
income
,
primarily
black
residents
were
promised
a
right
of
return
.
After
demolition
began
in
2003
,
most
people
in
Few
Gardens
never
returned
and
there
was
no
record
of
where
they
went
,
says
Gunn
,
who
had
family
in
the
former
public
housing
site
.
Again
,
the
city
said
we
tried
,
but
housing
costs
were
more
than
expected
.
It
was
out
of
our
control
,
’
Gunn
continues
.
Today
,
the
bond
proposed
will
again
disproportionately
impact
black
and
brown
folks
in
the
community
,
yet
so
far
,
their
concerns
have
not
been
met
with
concrete
changes
to
the
bond
in
writing
.
Just
like
the
leadership
that
passed
the
Urban
Renewal
Project
of
1960
and
the
Hope
VI
grant
for
Few
Gardens
,
Gunn
believes
that
Durham’s
leadership
lacks
authentic
relationships
with
the
community
members
that
will
be
impacted
most
.
If
elected
,
he
would
be
one
of
two
city
council
members
born
and
raised
in
Durham
;
the
other
is
Vernetta
Alston
.

Though
Gunn
is
advocating
to
pass
the
bond
,
we
need
to
ensure
accountability
measures
.
One
way
to
do
so
is
by
electing
leaders
next
week
who
will
fight
for
these
measures
in
writing
after
the
bond
is
passed
.
Accountability
means
an
oversight
committee
including
members
from
the
communities
that
will
be
impacted
most
;
keeping
track
of
the
people
who
will
be
relocated
during
construction
;
and
realistic
,
precise
numbers
that
residents
can
hold
leaders
accountable
to
.
So
when
you’re
at
the
polls
today
,
consider
your
options
will
you
remember
Durham’s
broken
promises
?
The
Chronicle
Opinion
section
has
a
reputation
for
being
a
sounding
board
for
complaints
and
rightly
so
.
Every
day
,
opinion
writers
myself
included
release
new
pieces
slamming
Duke
,
its
faculty
or
its
students
.
This
work
,
I
believe
,
is
part
of
what
makes
the
Chronicle
so
important
it
is
highly
critical
of
how
we
function
as
a
powerful
institution
.
We
interrogate
and
critique
the
power
hungry
finance
and
consulting
culture
,
toxic
masculinity
and
rampant
effortless
perfection
on
campus
.
Nonetheless
,
I
think
the
opinion
section
is
on
the
verge
of
being
a
homogenous
outlet
for
campus
critique
.
This
is
not
unique
to
the
Chronicle
,
as
the
majority
of
news
sources
present
their
consumers
with
stories
of
disaster
,
corruption
,
and
violence
.
With
this
in
mind
,
the
impossible
question
is
whether
or
not
the
majority
of
the
world’s
happenings
are
actually
that
negative
.
nbsp
;
Worryingly
,
a
high
proportion
of
negative
news
is
capable
of
distorting
our
perceptions
of
the
world
.
Psychologists
Amos
Tversky
and
Daniel
Kahneman
coined
the
term
,
availability
heuristic
,
people’s
estimate
of
the
probability
or
frequency
of
an
event
based
on
the
ease
with
which
it
comes
to
mind
.
When
people
are
presented
day
after
day
with
stories
on
shootings
,
murders
,
airplane
crashes
and
kidnappings
,
they
are
likely
to
assume
these
improbable
events
present
an
imminent
danger
,
eliciting
constant
anxiety
and
paranoia
.
While
these
are
tragic
realities
of
the
world
,
news
outlets
are
more
inclined
to
present
readers
with
news
likely
to
trigger
an
emotionally
negative
reaction
.
The
amygdala
,
the
fear
and
rage
response
center
in
our
brains
,
scans
our
sensory
input
,
remaining
alert
of
any
potential
dangers
.
nbsp
;
As
a
result
,
readers
are
inundated
every
day
with
countless
headlines
of
the
latest
manifestations
of
evil
in
the
world
and
offered
little
evidence
of
its
many
joys
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
atrocities
are
rare
,
but
rather
,
that
for
every
noted
horror
story
,
there
is
an
unwritten
,
unnoted
story
of
love
and
happiness
.
Research
shows
that
the
cost
of
this
hyper
consumption
of
negative
news
can
contribute
to
issues
such
as
agoraphobia
,
social
anxiety
,
post
traumatic
stress
disorder
,
insomnia
,
religious
and
racial
intolerance
and
depression
.
While
there
is
an
artillery
of
data
proving
the
detrimental
effects
of
this
phenomenon
,
it
seems
intuitive
that
as
empathetic
social
creatures
,
we
feel
pain
and
anxiety
when
confronted
with
an
infinite
daily
stream
of
human
suffering
.
While
the
Chronicle
and
its
reporters
and
columnists
are
not
in
pursuit
of
providing
click
bait
,
the
presentation
and
consumption
of
bad
news
without
account
of
the
good
runs
rampant
in
both
the
Opinion
and
News
sections
of
the
Chronicle
.
We
as
columnists
and
reporters
,
perhaps
unintentionally
,
model
what
we
see
from
professional
news
sources
.
Plus
,
Duke
,
being
the
problematic
institution
that
it
is
,
is
an
easy
target
.
If
someone
who
doesn’t
go
to
Duke
was
to
learn
about
our
school
through
the
lens
of
the
Chronicle
,
they
might
assume
its
students
to
be
a
miserable
bunch
,
learning
from
ignorant
professors
,
studying
at
an
institution
that
corroborates
evil
powers
in
support
of
ICE
all
within
a
social
culture
that
breeds
exclusivity
and
greed
.
While
these
are
realities
,
they
do
not
tell
the
full
story
.
For
every
hate
group
or
immoral
person
who
comes
to
speak
at
Duke
,
there
is
an
altruistic
group
and
a
speaker
in
pursuit
of
peace
and
justice
These
just
don’t
make
the
headlines
.
For
every
scamming
researcher
,
there
are
over
a
thousand
researchers
pursuing
ethical
work
.
While
it
makes
perfect
sense
for
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
to
make
a
headline
,
the
peace
itself
should
be
highlighted
,
too

Although
critiques
of
Duke
may
not
weigh
as
heavy
on
the
heart
as
headlines
of
war
,
political
corruption
and
human
plight
due
to
climate
change
,
consuming
negative
news
about
the
space
we
inhabit
is
likely
to
contribute
to
a
negative
perception
,
or
negative
availability
heuristic
of
our
surroundings
.
The
Chronicle
could
be
a
source
of
celebration
of
the
joy
,
love
and
greatness
that
exist
at
Duke
just
as
much
as
it
is
a
platform
to
expose
its
problems
.
It’s
time
I
do
a
better
job
of
striking
a
balance
.
In
my
time
so
far
at
Duke
,
I’ve
often
felt
that
I
don’t
belong
here
.
Not
because
I
feel
like
I
don’t
fit
in
with
the
people
here
,
or
because
I
feel
like
I
didn’t
deserve
to
be
admitted
,
but
because
I
don’t
feel
like
I’m
giving
anything
to
Duke
itself
.
I
take
lots
of
things
.
I
consume
and
consume
the
products
Duke
offers
me
,
but
I
don’t
really
give
it
anything
in
return
.
Duke
doesn’t
even
ask
me
to
give
it
anything
in
return
,
except
capital
.
I
have
no
delusion
that
all
my
fellow
Duke
undergrads
similarly
feel
that
they
don’t
belong
here
,
but
I
do
think
that
most
of
us
interact
with
Duke
as
an
institution
where
we
are
offered
products
to
consume
,
not
as
a
place
we
participate
in
.
Or
,
in
different
words
,
Duke
is
not
a
garden
we
help
grow
,
but
a
resource
we
reap
.
Because
of
this
,
we
treat
the
staff
poorly
in
addition
to
not
feeling
like
we
are
a
proper
part
of
this
place
Our
consumption
most
commonly
is
mindless
and
ubiquitous
.
I
go
to
Marketplace
breakfast
and
eat
food
grown
or
raised
in
places
that
I
can
only
guess
at
,
harvested
,
slaughtered
,
packaged
and
transported
by
a
system
I
barely
understand
involving
countless
people
that
I’ll
never
meet
all
before
it
even
arrives
on
Duke
campus
.
Then
,
once
it’s
here
at
Duke
,
I
still
do
not
participate
in
its
preparation
.
I
simply
walk
into
Marketplace
and
it’s
there
ready
to
be
cooked
for
me
on
request
,
or
even
simply
sitting
out
for
me
to
grab
.
I
do
not
know
who
bakes
or
sets
out
the
chocolate
croissants
,
much
less
who
cleans
my
dishes
and
mops
the
floors
when
I
leave
.
My
relation
to
food
here
is
exclusively
consumptive
.
There
are
other
students
who
know
the
dining
staff
and
how
the
food
comes
to
us
better
than
I
,
but
by
and
large
,
we
relate
to
the
food
we
eat
as
a
mysteriously
produced
commodity
ready
for
our
consumption
.
We
consume
the
services
of
the
maintenance
staff
even
more
unconsciously
.
nbsp
;
People
boys
can
pee
on
the
toilet
seat
and
by
the
next
morning
,
their
mess
will
have
been
cleaned
up
without
them
having
to
bat
an
eye
.
The
lawns
stay
mowed
,
each
and
every
building
clean
and
fully
operational
,
our
energy
systems
churning
onwards
,
the
buses
ready
for
use
.
And
then
there
is
the
massive
administrative
support
system
,
ready
to
help
us
travel
abroad
,
help
with
financial
aid
,
plan
our
class
schedule
,
send
our
transcripts
,
help
with
IT
issues
,
etc
.
etc
.
I’ve
surely
left
large
holes
in
detailing
the
products
Duke
offers
.
I
don’t
even
know
who
plans
the
Duke
performances
or
how
construction
is
run
,
for
instance
.
But
nonetheless
,
I
hope
the
picture
is
clear
.
Duke
as
an
institution
is
composed
of
a
massive
web
of
people
and
resources
doing
a
variety
of
tasks
in
a
variety
of
locations
.
All
of
which
we
can
consume
without
participating
in
.
We
don’t
have
to
help
Duke
provide
us
these
products
.
We
aren’t
asked
to
help
cook
or
clean
in
exchange
for
being
here
.
We
are
consumers
and
that
is
enough
.
Importantly
,
this
makes
it
far
easier
to
ignore
and
abuse
the
services
of
staff
members
here
at
Duke
.
Or
at
the
very
least
,
to
complain
about
their
work
much
more
readily
than
we
would
if
we
actually
knew
the
difficulties
of
their
jobs
.
The
two
seeds
one
might
argue
we
do
indeed
we
sow
,
or
,
the
two
ways
that
we
do
indeed
participate
in
our
institution
,
are
through
paying
it
money
and
through
academic
research
.
To
me
,
both
of
these
are
problematic
and
potentially
empty
ways
of
participating
.
First
of
all
,
not
everyone
pays
to
come
here
,
but
more
importantly
,
buying
a
good
puts
us
as
the
consumer
in
the
relationship
.
We
allow
Duke
to
function
through
financial
support
,
but
financial
support
does
not
involve
us
in
how
things
actually
get
done
here
.

The
idea
of
providing
capital
instead
of
labor
is
central
here
.
In
giving
capital
,
we
don’t
do
anything
,
we
simply
give
something
.
To
today’s
ear
,
giving
may
seem
to
fall
under
the
broad
category
doing
,
and
,
of
course
,
it
is
in
a
sense
.
But
more
importantly
,
the
two
are
quite
different
in
that
giving
is
indirect
while
doing
is
direct
.
If
students
were
responsible
for
cooking
food
for
themselves
and
others
,
we’d
directly
feel
ourselves
to
be
giving
to
the
institution
and
the
general
Duke
community
.
Paying
money
is
completely
different
.
There
we
are
buying
a
product
and
giving
to
Duke
only
indirectly
.
Participating
in
Duke
by
doing
academic
research
academic
labor
is
more
compelling
,
but
still
not
very
.
The
fact
of
the
matter
is
simply
that
undergrads
don’t
contribute
all
that
much
to
the
research
or
academia
machine
.
Sure
,
every
now
and
then
students
do
some
important
research
work
,
but
the
vast
majority
of
academic
products
produced
by
Duke
books
,
scientific
innovations
,
policy
ideas
,
etc
.
come
from
faculty
and
graduate
students
.
To
return
to
the
idea
of
belonging
,
I
personally
find
it
very
important
to
participate
in
an
institution
,
community
,
household
,
etc
.
to
feel
like
a
part
of
it
.
Sure
,
there
is
a
sense
in
which
I
feel
like
I
belong
in
the
Harris
Teeter
by
East
Campus
at
this
point
in
the
year
.
I
have
my
VIC
card
,
I
know
my
way
around
the
store
,
I
can
afford
to
buy
food
there
,
but
that’s
not
the
type
of
belonging
that
I’m
interested
in
.
I
want
to
be
a
part
of
something
,
not
merely
a
source
of
capital
.
To
feel
like
I
belong
here
at
Duke
,
I’d
have
to
feel
like
I
was
more
than
just
a
consumer
.
To
belong
somewhere
,
you
must
be
a
part
of
that
place
.
And
a
part
that
merely
consumes
without
giving
seems
to
me
like
a
part
that
doesn’t
belong
.
Perhaps
I’ve
gotten
tangled
up
in
my
words
,
and
should
simply
say
that
I
don’t
feel
like
a
participant
here
at
Duke
,
making
no
claim
as
to
the
feeling
of
belonging
.
But
I
think
that
there
is
a
deep
sense
in
which
Duke
like
most
American
colleges
and
universities
right
now
alienates
its
students
by
treating
them
as
consumers
.
Students
can
find
belonging
in
there
time
here
,
but
it
is
much
more
likely
to
be
with
friends
and
with
sub
groups
than
with
Duke
itself
.
We
can
have
school
pride
without
feeling
like
we
belong
here
as
part
of
the
place
.
As
it
stands
we
are
most
often
mere
beneficiaries
.
And
so
long
as
I
feel
like
a
mere
beneficiary
I
won’t
feel
like
I
truly
belong
here
.
Fake
news
makes
good
programming
.
From
elaborately
spun
stories
on
Fox
News
to
articles
on
,
these
entertainment
stories
are
more
appealing
than
understanding
current
events
.
When
was
the
last
time
you
remembered
a
fact
about
a
celebrity
but
could
not
cite
a
recent
news
story
?
I
think
of
Jimmy
Kimmel’s
Lie
Witness
News
where
he
interviews
strangers
about
fake
news
stories
and
receives
bald
faced
lies
as
responses
.
He
leaves
the
viewer
both
laughing
and
worried
about
how
easily
susceptible
and
uninformed
many
of
us
are
.
While
some
may
be
quick
to
dismiss
the
opinions
of
people
on
the
streets
of
Los
Angeles
,
the
same
lack
of
awareness
about
top
news
events
holds
true
on
our
Duke
Campus
.
I
interviewed
several
students
on
campus
about
the
impeachment
trials
against
President
Trump
happening
right
now
.
In
classic
Lie
Witness
News
style
,
however
,
some
of
the
questions
were
open
ended
to
understand
what
students
know
,
but
many
of
the
questions
were
verifiably
false
.
Answers
to
questions
simply
about
what
the
general
premise
of
impeachment
largely
centered
around
Russia
.
Russia
.
Blackmail
.
Dark
internet
or
whatever
,
said
one
sophomore
.
Another

No

Final
answer

When
asked
if
she
was
surprised
to
hear
that
the
recent
hearings
implicated
Vice
President
Mike
Pence
as
a
potential
whistleblower
,
one
sophomore
responded
,
No
.
Definitely
not
.
If
you
are
the
vice
president
of
Trump
you
definitely
know
shit
!
Pence
was
not
mentioned
as
a
potential
whistleblower
.
The
quickness
and
confidence
of
her
answer
scared
but
did
not
surprise
me
.
Not
only
are
many
of
us
walking
around
this
campus
oblivious
to
what
will
undoubtedly
be
a
historic
impeachment
trial
and
presidency
,
but
we
fake
knowledge
.
If
you
don’t
know
it
,
own
it
.
I
would
rather
have
someone
outrightly
admit
to
their
ignorance
than
feign
knowledge
.
It
is
in
this
need
to
pretend
to
know
mindset
that
the
facts
get
lost
.
Embarrassed
of
ignorance
,
we
are
more
likely
to
accept
false
stories
.
Somewhere
we
dismiss
our
responsibility
to
decipher
and
synthesize
multiple
news
sources
.
In
addition
to
the
consequences
of
ignorance
and
unfounded
confidence
,
the
motivations
behind
some
of
the
responses
troubled
me
.
Why
do
we
pretend
to
know
current
events
?
Is
it
that
we
think
we
should
know
?
Why
do
we
feel
guilty
or
judged
for
not
regularly
checking
the
news
?
As
a
senior
noted
,
I
should
be
way
more
in
the
loop
with
things
.
I
am
trying
to
make
an
effort
this
year
,
but
it
is
really
not
working
.
In
today’s
era
of
fake
news
we
all
need
to
be
vigilant
about
what
we
consume
.
I
think
of
the
recent
elections
in
North
Carolina
and
the
impending
presidential
election
as
a
constant
reminder
of
my
role
as
a
contributing
citizen
to
read
the
news
.
Frankly
,
voting
without
an
effort
to
understand
current
events
is
unethical
.

For
some
,
however
,
following
politics
comes
at
the
expense
of
relationships
.
This
time
of
year
,
especially
,
I
am
reminded
of
the
Thanksgiving
dinner
table
ruined
by
the
mention
of
political
candidates
or
divisive
issues
.
There
is
a
lot
of
merit
to
these
words
.
As
seen
by
fake
news
or
swayed
stories
,
our
sense
of
news
and
opinion
has
been
almost
purposefully
convoluted
.
However
,
the
divisiveness
of
current
media
is
exactly
why
we
need
more
people
invested
in
politics
.
By
understanding
current
events
,
we
can
counter
a
black
and
white
depiction
of
modern
politics
and
help
color
conversations
with
diverse
people
and
experiences
.
I
should
note
that
there
were
multiple
students
interviewed
with
a
more
in
depth
understanding
of
current
news
events
and
the
impeachment
than
me
.
One
freshman
quoted
a
line
from
testimony
earlier
in
the
day
and
proceeded
to
tell
me
the
implications
of
the
statement
on
the
trial
at
large
.
In
my
own
experience
,
I
fall
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
current
events
knowledge
spectrum
.
I
pride
myself
on
regularly
checking
the
news
,
but
often
fall
short
in
my
understanding
of
current
events
.
I
have
learned
to
lean
into
the
differences
,
the
diversity
of
experiences
,
the
depth
of
knowledge
and
biases
that
many
discussions
on
campus
have
.
I
would
much
rather
nbsp
;
spend
a
night
in
Perkins
whispering
about
the
ramifications
of
another
school
shooting
than
completing
any
problem
set
.
It’s
these
moments
that
bring
me
closer
to
my
friends
and
this
campus
.
Please
follow
nbsp
;
the
news
.
From
different
sources
.
From
different
points
of
view
.
Know
how
people
in
Kansas
think
and
what
people
in
New
York
think
and
what
you
think
about
an
issue
.
Talk
to
you
friends
about
politics
and
set
aside
fears
of
conflict
.
I
would
argue
that
it
is
only
when
we
agree
on
the
facts
that
we
can
have
any
discussion
or
sense
of
community
.
When
we
read
and
educate
ourselves
that
we
can
ever
bridge
the
divides
that
already
separate
us
.
In
a
2018
campus
wide
survey
,
48
of
female
undergraduates
reported
having
been
sexually
assaulted
since
coming
to
Duke
.
This
means
over
1
,
700
undergraduate
women
have
been
sexually
assaulted
,
a
statistic
that
even
Larry
Moneta
suggested
was
under
representative
.
Yet
in
the
2018
2019
academic
year
,
only
169
reports
were
made
to
the
Office
of
Student
Conduct
.
Those
numbers
don’t
add
up
.
Jayne
Grandes
,
Assistant
Vice
President
of
Title
IX
Compliance
at
Duke
,
says
she’d
like
to
see
more
victims
report
.
Before
doing
research
for
this
column
,
I
would’ve
wholeheartedly
agreed
.
In
my
mind
,
every
survivor’s
contribution
to
the
reporting
system
would
improve
it
for
others
who
choose
to
come
forward
in
the
future
.
But
I
did
not
comprehend
just
how
time
consuming
,
traumatizing
and
demoralizing
it
can
be
for
a
survivor
to
report
.
Now
I’m
torn
.
Why
should
a
survivor
report
when
that
process
at
Duke
will
likely
do
them
more
harm
than
good
?
For
a
student
seeking
to
report
,
the
odds
of
receiving
a
positive
result
are
practically
insurmountable
.
Of
the
169
reports
made
last
year
,
only
nine
were
referred
for
investigation
.
Six
of
those
resulted
in
hearings
.
Three
individuals
were
found
responsible
.
Out
of
169
three
.
Those
are
the
odds
survivors
are
up
against
.
What’s
more
,
survivors
may
feel
that
reporting
is
more
trouble
than
it’s
worth
.
Sabrina
Maciariello
,
a
senior
,
was
assaulted
in
January
of
her
freshman
year
and
reasoned
that
she
had
nothing
to
gain
from
reporting
.
The
issue
wasn’t
that
he
was
going
to
contact
me
or
that
I
was
afraid
he’d
do
it
again
.
The
issue
was
just
that
it
happened
,
she
said
.
Already
burdened
by
the
trauma
of
the
assault
and
the
pressure
of
maintaining
normalcy
in
the
face
of
unrelenting
academic
,
extracurricular
and
social
obligations
,
Maciariello
was
in
no
position
to
prioritize
what
she
assumed
to
be
restorative
justice
.
The
trauma
forced
upon
many
victims
of
sexual
assault
is
immobilizing
.
Another
survivor
let’s
call
him
Ben
recalled
that
the
day
after
his
assault
,
he
had
four
panic
attacks
.
The
weeks
and
months
following
weren’t
much
easier
.
Your
brain
can’t
cope
.
Finishing
your
homework
and
getting
to
your
classes
becomes
really
difficult
,
he
said
.
While
reporting
soon
after
an
assault
occurs
may
make
it
easier
to
gather
evidence
,
this
isn’t
the
first
thing
on
a
survivor’s
mind
.
Even
if
Maciariello
had
wanted
to
report
,
she
certainly
wasn’t
emotionally
able
to
do
so
right
after
her
assault
.
After
a
friend
accidentally
called
the
Office
of
Student
Conduct
OSC
the
night
of
her
assault
,
Maciariello
received
three
emails
the
following
morning
one
from
OSC
,
one
from
the
Women’s
Center
and
one
from
DukeReach
.
Overwhelmed
and
distraught
,
Maciariello
neglected
to
respond
to
any
of
the
emails
.
She
wouldn’t
seek
therapy
until
three
months
later
.
Survivors
face
this
trauma
,
isolation
and
shame
even
without
a
sexual
assault
investigation
hanging
over
their
heads
.
Amy
Cleckler
,
MPH
and
former
Office
of
Gender
Violence
Prevention
and
Intervention
coordinator
at
the
Women’s
Center
,
attests
that
the
reporting
process
can
compound
a
survivor’s
distress
.
The
reporting
process
,
even
handled
as
efficiently
,
fairly
,
and
supportively
as
possible
,
can
create
additional
stress
and
trauma
,
she
told
me
.
If
the
reporting
process
is
carried
out
until
a
final
verdict
is
issued
,
the
stress
of
telling
and
retelling
the
events
,
sitting
down
for
a
hearing
in
the
same
room
as
your
perpetrator
,
and
being
questioned
about
extremely
personal
details
can
exacerbate
symptoms
of
anxiety
,
depression
and
PTSD
,
she
said
.
In
theory
,
reporting
doesn’t
have
to
require
substantial
commitment
by
the
survivor
.
Jayne
Grandes
notes
that
every
report
contributes
in
some
way
to
OSC’s
understanding
of
sexual
assault
on
campus
.
Reporting
doesn’t
mean
a
complainant
has
to
go
through
the
investigative
process
;
they
can
just
tell
us
what
they
want
to
share
,
and
what
they
need
,
so
we
can
best
support
them
,
she
told
me
.
It
also
gives
us
more
information
as
to
what’s
happening
so
we
can
improve
our
prevention
and
response
efforts
.

Such
a
perspective
seems
logical
and
fits
the
needs
of
some
survivors
.
But
for
many
others
,
in
the
weeks
and
months
that
follow
an
assault
,
merely
admitting
that
they’ve
been
assaulted
is
terrifying
.
As
Cleckler
contends
,
when
even
those
closest
to
a
survivor
cannot
always
provide
support
without
doubt
or
judgment
,
it
makes
it
harder
for
survivors
to
imagine
telling
their
story
to
a
total
stranger
,
like
a
police
officer
or
a
Duke
administrator
.
Ben
describes
a
psychological
distance
between
a
survivor’s
state
right
after
an
assault
and
many
months
after
,
as
survivors
slowly
process
and
come
to
terms
with
their
trauma
.
Such
distance
from
the
event
may
finally
allow
survivors
to
confront
the
option
of
reporting
.
If
the
system
was
totally
informed
,
that
arc
would
be
accounted
for
.
Two
years
after
her
assault
,
Maciariello
decided
to
consider
reporting
.
Her
therapist
recommended
she
call
Victoria
Krebs
,
Associate
Dean
of
Students
for
Title
IX
Outreach
and
Response
,
to
discuss
her
options
.
After
asking
Maciariello
to
summarize
her
story
and
what
documentation
she
had
,
Krebs
asserted
that
Maciariello
didn’t
have
enough
evidence
to
prove
that
she
had
even
gone
to
her
assailant’s
dorm
room
that
night
,
let
alone
that
an
assault
actually
occurred
.
Maciariello
reminded
me
of
Krebs’
responsibility
to
mediate
liability
It’s
her
literal
job
to
prevent
you
from
making
a
case
in
order
to
protect
the
school
.
While
Grandes
assures
that
not
all
OSC
employees
must
consider
the
potential
for
negative
press
in
these
cases
,
OSC
is
still
forced
to
weigh
the
liability
Duke
could
incur
if
they
fail
to
adequately
address
an
assault
with
,
say
,
a
possible
hit
to
the
University’s
reputation
if
the
case
is
publicized
or
a
potential
lawsuit
filed
by
the
assailant
.
It’s
unrealistic
to
expect
a
survivor
to
keep
the
kind
of
robust
records
required
to
implicate
an
assailant
,
especially
considering
that
at
least
50
of
all
student
sexual
assaults
involve
alcohol
.
Maciariello
recalls
how
similar
circumstances
thwarted
her
case
.
When
he
left
the
room
,
I
couldn’t
text
because
I
was
so
drunk
,
she
recounted
to
me
.
I
could
only
call
.
All
I
had
from
that
night
was
an
outbound
call
to
my
friend
,
and
he
had
an
Uber
receipt
to
his
dorm
.
If
Maciariello
was
so
drunk
she
couldn’t
send
a
text
,
she
clearly
wasn’t
able
to
consent
to
any
sexual
activity
.
But
this
reasoning
,
no
matter
how
common
,
wasn’t
enough
to
appease
the
system
.
Victoria
Krebs
was
right
Maciariello
had
no
concrete
evidence
to
support
a
case
against
her
assailant
.
And
without
a
case
,
she
was
effectively
forced
to
give
up
.
Many
students
,
17
of
the
169
last
year
,
choose
to
seek
a
No
Contact
Directive
rather
than
a
formal
investigation
.
A
No
Contact
Directive
,
effectively
an
on
campus
restraining
order
,
offers
an
appealing
option
for
survivors
who
don’t
want
to
proceed
with
a
formal
reporting
process
but
who
seek
to
prevent
any
potential
future
communication
with
their
assailant
.
However
,
even
this
can
be
daunting
,
as
it
requires
that
the
assailant
be
informed
of
the
report
lodged
against
them
.
Duke’s
relatively
small
campus
and
tight
social
networks
leave
survivors
more
vulnerable
to
backlash
from
the
assailant
or
their
friends
.
Perhaps
survivors
do
have
something
to
gain
from
reporting
.
But
they
also
have
plenty
to
lose
their
dignity
,
the
coping
skills
they’ve
worked
so
hard
to
incorporate
,
and
any
confidence
that
their
experiences
are
legitimate
.
Every
survivor’s
story
matters
,
but
not
every
story
can
stand
up
to
the
system
.
As
a
woman
at
Duke
who
wants
to
see
the
reporting
process
improve
long
term
,
I’d
theoretically
like
to
see
more
survivors
report
.
But
now
that
I
see
the
reality
of
that
process
even
as
removed
from
the
direct
experience
of
survivors
as
I
am
if
I
was
in
a
similar
situation
,
I
don’t
know
that
I
would
choose
to
report
.
I
think
I’d
choose
myself
.
And
for
many
survivors
,
reporting
and
healing
are
mutually
exclusive
.
You
know
that
references
are
still
culturally
relevant
but
I
think
this
one
is
important
to
my
story
so
I’m
gonna
go
for
it
and
if
it
doesn’t
land
,
well
,
the
ten
people
who
make
up
The
Chronicle
opinion
section’s
readership
base
will
just
have
to
wait
another
two
weeks
for
Alex
Frumkin’s
follow
up
to
his
column
about
bean
burgers
.
Where
was
I
?
Right
,
Festivus
.
So
in
this
episode
,
George’s
dad
celebrates
a
holiday
called
Festivus
as
a
substitute
for
Christmas
.
There
are
a
couple
of
marginally
funny
traditions
associated
with
the
holiday
but
the
main
one
is
an
airing
of
grievances
in
which
you
gather
your
family
around
and
tell
them
all
the
ways
they
have
disappointed
you
over
the
past
year
.
The
reason
I
bring
that
up
is
because
I
feel
like
this
year
The
Chronicle
Opinion
Section
has
been
one
big
airing
of
grievances
and
I
love
all
of
it
.
Columnists
as
of
late
have
not
been
afraid
to
fire
shots
at
one
another
it
makes
for
compelling
reading
,
much
needed
,
in
my
opinion
,
for
a
publication
that
seems
to
run
articles
on
a
weekly
basis
about
the
cat
that
lives
on
West
campus
.
As
someone
who
has
both
fired
and
received
some
shots
,
I
like
to
think
that
ultimately
it’s
all
in
good
spirits
and
that
the
discourse
in
most
cases
positively
contributes
to
the
campus
discussion
on
whatever
the
issue
in
question
might
be
.
More
often
than
not
the
most
memorable
columns
are
the
ones
you
take
the
most
issue
with
.
For
example
,
you
may
not
agree
with
everyone’s
favorite
snowflake
fighting
duo
Matthew
Noles
and
Mitch
Murphy
I
know
I
personally
don’t
,
but
their
articles
lead
me
to
formulate
my
own
thoughts
as
to
how
I
disagree
with
them
.
I
think
that’s
a
valuable
exercise
.
Not
the
most
original
of
concepts
,
I
know
,
but
I
thought
I’d
at
least
try
to
sneak
something
of
substance
into
this
thing
before
it
really
derails
.
On
to
the
derailing
Since
I’ve
pretty
much
said
what
I
wanted
to
say
already
,
I
thought
I
would
end
with
an
airing
of
some
of
my
personal
grievances
.
It’s
not
a
complete
list
,
but
off
the
top
of
my
head
here
,
in
bullet
point
form
,
goes
nothing

making
arm
of
the
non
profit
that
is
Duke
University
.
While
the
estimated
cost
of
attendance
at
Duke
is
already
a
staggering
78
,
608
per
year
,
that
number
does
not
include
the
toll
that
Duke
Parking
amp
;
Transportation
will
take
on
your
finances
.
For
many
Duke
students
,
having
a
car
and
a
spot
in
which
to
put
it
is
a
necessity
,
given
that
getting
around
,
whether
it
be
to
a
job
,
internship
,
volunteer
,
or
family
obligations
,
requires
a
car
.
Nonetheless
,
this
necessity
costs
Duke
students
a
whopping
423
per
year
,
the
price
of
a
Blue
Zone
permit
.
While
there
are
free
After
Hours
permits
,
this
does
not
suffice
for
those
who
live
on
campus
.
At
Duke
,
47
percent
of
students
receive
need
based
financial
aid
.
Despite
financial
aid
support
,
many
students
still
pay
more
than
they
can
afford
to
attend
Duke
,
working
several
jobs
all
the
while
.
It
seems
willfully
ignorant
to
charge
such
an
abhorrent
price
.
Although
the
Blue
Zone
Permit
is
inconvenient
and
absurdly
priced
,
it’s
harmless
in
comparison
to
Duke
Parking
amp
;
Transportation’s
ticketing
system
.
Before
every
football
game
day
,
Blue
Zone
permit
holders
are
required
to
move
their
cars
into
other
designated
Duke
lots
to
make
room
for
game
goers
within
a
several
hour
time
period
.
The
day
after
the
game
,
students
are
required
to
have
removed
their
cars
from
the
alternative
parking
lots
by
2
p

Several
times
,
after
getting
out
of
a
late
rowing
practice
,
I
have
had
to
move
my
car
in
the
late
evening
.
On
these
occasions
I
had
to
walk
home
alone
at
night
from
the
Flowers
lot
to
West
Campus
.
Needless
to
say
,
it
is
extremely
unsafe
to
be
a
young
woman
alone
at
night
on
Duke’s
campus
and
this
policy
puts
women
in
explicit
danger
.
Moreover
,
I
was
an
athlete
and
was
required
to
travel
on
weekends
to
compete
.
Several
times
,
when
I
returned
to
my
car
Monday
morning
,
I
had
to
beg
Duke
Parking
amp
;
Transportation
to
allow
me
to
simply
exit
the
parking
lot
,
as
I
had
missed
the
exit
window
.
One
game
day
,
I
had
an
athlete
pass
on
my
car
signifying
I
didn’t
need
to
move
my
car
.
Unsurprisingly
,
I
was
still
ticketed
and
towed
for
a
whopping
250
100
to
be
ticketed
,
100
to
be
towed
,
and

For
our
second
set
of
D
Debates
,
we’re
going
to
be
looking
at
Duke
and
Desis
.
Today
,
I’m
going
to
provide
a
different
way
of
thinking
about
the
Indian
American
identity
as
it
stands
in
2019
.
Now
before
I
start
,
I
feel
a
need
to
offer
a
disclaimer
.
Identity
is
personal
.
nbsp
;
I’m
going
to
try
here
to
be
as
representative
and
fair
as
possible
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
these
are
my
views
regarding
an
identity
that
I
belong
to
,
and
I
am
always
willing
to
hear
about
other
experiences
.
That
said
,
my
biggest
struggle
as
an
Indian
American
has
been
figuring
out
which
of
the
two
I
am
Indian
or
American
.
Because
it’s
clear
to
me
that
there
isn’t
yet
a
concrete
,
separate
identity
for
the
Indian
American
.
The
reason
for
this
is
threefold
for
one
,
only
about
one
percent
of
the
American
population
identifies
as
Indian
American
.
A
culture
grows
stronger
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
people
it
encompasses
.
With
such
a
small
population
,
it’s
hard
to
say
we
have
carved
out
a
distinct
or
unified
identity
.
Instead
,
we
generally
get
shuffled
to
the
bottom
of
the
pile
,
lost
somewhere
in
a
sea
of
black
and
whiteness
.
The
second
reason
is
that
we
simply
haven’t
been
around
that
long
.
As
a
counterexample
,
though
their
early
history
in
this
country
is
marred
by
the
atrocities
of
the
slave
trade
,
African
Americans
have
been
a
major
part
of
the
United
States’
population
breakdown
since
the
colonial
era
.
Meanwhile
,
Indians
were
barely
trickling
into
America
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
this
rate
didn’t
pick
up
until
some
fifty
years
later
.
Time
is
a
key
ingredient
in
shaping
cultures
.
It
creates
distinct
identities
as
people
live
through
common
experiences
and
work
together
to
develop
cultural
traditions
.
Since
Indian
migration
to
the
United
States
has
been
such
a
recent
phenomenon
,
it
still
matters
whether
we
are
first
generation
or
second
generation
.
And
finally
,
there’s
the
simple
fact
that
the
Indian
side
of
Indian
American
is
such
a
vastly
complex
identity
.
Most
Indian
Americans
have
,
at
some
point
in
their
lives
,
been
victims
to
that
one
particularly
cringe
worthy
question
This
question
is
especially
painful
to
those
of
us
who
recognize
the
unbelievable
diversity
of
the
Indian
subcontinent
.
Whether
you
look
at
its
thousands
of
languages
,
hundreds
of
styles
of
cuisine
or
seven
major
coexisting
religious
groups
,
it
seems
clear
that
India
was
never
meant
to
be
packed
into
the
narrow
box
of
a
single
identity
.
When
we
try
to
draw
the
lines
to
form
a
singular
Indian
American
identity
,
there’s
far
too
many
cultures
and
traditions
that
could
get
left
out
.
Having
established
,
to
some
degree
,
that
the
Desis
adding
in
that
lethal
C
word
because
we
knew
we
had
strayed
too
far
from
the
identities
of
our
ancestors
to
merely
be
Indians
born
in
America
.
All
I
know
is
that
one
summer
,
when
I
was
vacationing
in
India
,
I
realized
that
I
could
no
longer
call
myself
an
Indian
.
Or
rather
,
I
wasn’t
allowed
to
.
Maybe
it
was
the
condescension
in
some
of
my
relatives’
voices
when
they
scoffed
at
me
for
messing
up
a
religious
ritual
.
Maybe
it
was
the
hot
shame
in
my
ears
when
I
stumbled
over
words
of
Tamil
that
were
once
smoother
than
milk
and
honey
.
In
any
case
,
it
was
clear
that
I
was
different
.
A
perpetual
outsider
.
So
what
does
that
leave
the
Indian
American
with
?
Not
the
Indian
.
Not
the
American
.
Just
the
hyphen
in
the
middle
.
And
now
,
Bobby
Jindal
has
the
nerve
to
get
in
front
of
a
microphone
and
tell
me
that
the
hyphen
doesn’t
belong
to
us
,
either
.
One
of
the
best
things
I’ve
seen
at
Duke
so
far
is
the
efforts
of
so
many
other
Desis
to
add
meaning
to
that
hyphen
.
I
didn’t
join
Duke
Diya
,
the
South
Asian
society
,
just
so
I
could
get
in
touch
with
my
roots
.
I
joined
so
I
could
help
validate
and
define
our
identity
.
That
hyphen
is
a
sign
of
adaptation
.
It
means
that
we
have
overcome
rejection
and
are
working
to
convert
it
into
something
new
.
To
all
the
other
Indian
Americans
in
the
room
,
I
ask
only
one
thing
Don’t
let
the
American
Desi
be
written
off
as
confused
.
Give
our
identity
definition
,
confidence
and
life
,
so
that
tomorrow’s
Indian
American
won’t
have
any
question
as
to
whether
he
or
she
belongs
.
The
more
exposure
you
have
to
social
media
,
the
more
likely
you
are
to
be
.
Does
this
mean
that
all
the
Duke
students
who
received
Apple
watches
can
become
addicted
to
social
media
?
In
fact
,
the
Apple
watch
study
may
be
fueling
an
addiction
even
more
worrisome
than
we
know
.
I
spent
this
past
summer
baffled
by
my
3
year
old
cousin
who
refused
to
eat
any
food
until
she
was
comfortably
scrolling
through
her
mother’s
Instagram
or
watching
a
video
on
YouTube
.
Within
the
first
week
of
coming
to
Duke
,
my
friend
in
Gilbert
Addoms
told
me
he
had
received
an
Apple
watch
and
could
not
help
but
check
his
notifications
as
they
came
in
.
Do
my
cousin
and
all
the
GA
residents
with
Apple
watches
use
social
media
excessively
?
Or
are
they
just
normal
Generation
Z
beings
?
In
March
,
2019
when
I
read
Roisin
Kiberd’s
opinion
column
in
The
Guardian
,
I
was
in
complete
denial
of
his
argument
that
the
human
race
is
better
described
as
a
populace
of
automatons
that
outsource
relationships
and
working
lives
to
the
internet
.
Can
a
ubiquitous
behavior
like
that
really
be
characterized
as
an
addiction
?
The
hoard
of
latest
findings
as
published
in
the
Science
Daily
that
swarms
my
inbox
undeniably
answer
this
question
.
Social
media
stress
leads
to
social
media
addiction
,
Excessive
social
media
use
is
comparable
to
drug
addiction
.
nbsp
;
nbsp
;
The
stereotypical
illustration
of
the
basement
dwelling
social
media
addict
is
certainly
not
new
.
Tamaki
Saitõ
,
a
Japanese
psychologist
,
coined
the
term
to
typify
reclusive
adolescents
in
Japan
who
traded
their
social
lives
for
internet
,
video
game
and
media
consumption
.
Unknowingly
and
unwittingly
,
we
are
all
part
of
this
and
it’s
reaching
dangerous
levels
.
It
came
as
a
shock
to
me
that
some
people
are
,
in
fact
,
more
susceptible
to
social
media
addiction
than
others
.
Neuroticism
the
degree
to
which
one’s
experience
of
the
world
elicits
anxiety
and
stress
increases
the
probability
of
growing
to
be
an
addict
.
On
the
other
hand
,
conscientiousness
the
quality
of
being
diligent
and
level
headed
decreases
this
probability
.
One’s
capacity
for
self
regulation
and
susceptibility
to
peer
pressure
also
serve
as
predictors
of
social
media
addiction
.
Studies
demonstrate
that
retweets
,
likes
and
shares
trigger
the
same
surge
of
dopamine
as
cocaine
.
It
is
not
only
the
nbsp
;
notifications
or
positive
social
feedback
,
but
the
act
of
self
disclosure
on
social
networking
sites
that
ignites
this
reward
system
.
This
means
that
individuals
place
high
subjective
value
on
opportunities
to
communicate
their
thoughts
and
feelings
to
others
.
However
,
social
media
is
not
only
physically
addictive
due
to
its
effect
on
the
brain
.
Reports
show
that
ten
minutes
spent
on
social
media
can
cause
a
spike
in
oxytocin
,
a
chemical
hormone
,
at
levels
equivalent
to
those
emitted
on
wedding
days
.
With
each
use
,
the
brain
slowly
rewires
in
such
a
way
that
one
experience
of
physiological
effects
decreases
for
the
same
amount
of
time
spent
on
the
social
platform
.
This
is
tolerance
building
.
Perhaps
in
a
few
decades
,
social
media
addiction
will
be
more
overtly
recognized
and
more
scientists
will
investigate
how
the
resilient
fraction
of
the
human
population
resists
checking
social
platforms
more
than
once
a
day
.
The
fact
that
27
of
children
who
spend
3
or
more
hours
a
day
on
social
media
exhibit
symptoms
of
poor
mental
health
calls
for
more
robust
,
longitudinal
systematic
studies
and
the
development
of
sustainable
regulatory
measures
.
The
next
time
you
see
your
friend
scrolling
through
her
phone
while
mindlessly
eating
at
West
Union
or
replying
to
your
snaps
a
second
after
you
send
them
,
maybe
suggest
going
for
a
walk
in
the
Sarah
P
Gardens
or
trying
zumba
at
the
Brodie
Gym
.
Flee
from
this
social
media
addiction
pandemic
.
Breathing
is
hard
when
it’s
hard
to
breathe
.
Messy
,
loud
,
deep
respirations
as
the
lungs
desperately
hold
onto
whatever
oxygen
it
can
.
Palpitations
when
the
heart
beats
in
overtime
.
A
stabbing
pain
in
the
chest
and
my
mind
trying
to
calm
the
symptoms
aren’t
I
too
young
to
be
having
a
heart
attack
?
Don’t
worry
,
my
mother
said
as
she
walked
past
me
curled
over
in
terror
on
the
couch
,
just
get
over
it
.
I
was
clearly
being
overdramatic
;
after
all
,
there
was
no
obvious
physical
trauma
.
And
so
,
she
grabbed
her
keys
and
drove
off
,
as
I
caved
under
the
pressure
beneath
my
ribcage
.
It
wasn’t
until
a
couple
years
later
that
I
learned
what
I’d
had
a
panic
attack
.
Like
many
Asian
immigrants
,
my
parents
are
quick
to
dismiss
any
symptoms
of
intangible
distress
.
Although
mental
health
awareness
in
the
United
States
has
increased
in
recent
years
,
many
people
still
falsely
believe
that
the
symptoms
are
overblown
.
These
misconceptions
are
alarming
,
especially
when
you
look
at
the
numbers
.
Given
the
prevalence
of
mental
health
disorders
,
you’d
think
that
there
would
be
more
encouragement
to
seek
help
.
Sadly
,
less
than
half
of
those
with
a
mental
illness
receive
treatment
.
And
for
those
who
do
,
the
average
delay
between
their
onset
of
symptoms
and
treatment
is
eleven
years
.
In
no
other
medical
condition
is
there
such
a
hesitancy
in
seeking
treatment
.
Can
you
imagine
waiting
over
a
decade
before
seeing
a
dentist
for
a
toothache
?
Asian
Americans
,
in
particular
,
are
more
likely
to
suffer
in
silence
.
They’re
three
times
less
likely
to
seek
out
mental
health
services
compared
to
white
Americans
.
And
when
they
do
reach
out
,
they
can
face
hostility
from
their
parents
.
Rather
than
listening
to
their
feelings
,
parents
may
question
why
they
can’t
simply
feel
better
.
After
all
,
many
immigrant
parents
had
to
overcome
numerous
hardships
to
succeed
in
the
United
States
.
From
parents’
perspective
,
their
children
have
little
to
complain
about
.
Instead
,
they
place
high
expectations
on
their
kids
,
expecting
them
to
appreciate
the
sacrifices
that
have
been
made
.
And
for
the
most
part
,
Asian
Americans
do
understand
.
Most
are
acutely
aware
of
the
relative
comfort
that
they
have
compared
to
their
parents
.
That’s
what
makes
it
difficult
to
reach
out
leaving
them
feeling
guilty
or
unsure
of
whether
their
own
feelings
are
valid
.
It
is
unfair
to
completely
blame
immigrant
parents
for
their
just
get
over
it
mentality
.
A
large
part
of
the
problem
is
rooted
in
cultural
stigma
.
In
many
Asian
countries
,
mental
illness
is
deemed
a
weakness
of
character
.
It
is
associated
with
a
failure
on
both
the
individual
and
the
family
.
A
person’s
social
standing
is
tied
to
the
familial
reputation
;
your
actions
are
a
reflection
of
your
parents’
parenting
.
When
it
comes
to
achievements
such
as
getting
into
a
top
college
,
both
the
student
and
the
parent
are
lauded
.
But
having
a
child
commit
suicide
is
seen
as
a
reflection
of
poor
parenting
;
a
failure
on
the
family
.
After
their
son
,
Evan
,
killed
himself
,
Katherine
Tong
talks
about
losing
friends
They
just
didn't
want
to
associate
with
us
,
because
they
think
this
problem
could
rub
off
on
their
family
.
Many
families
therefore
hide
relatives
with
mental
disorders
as
a
shameful
secret
.
They
fear
being
isolated
as
others
worry
about
catching
the
disease
too
.
As
a
result
,
in
order
to
maintain
social
respect
,
Asian
Americans
are
told
to
follow
the
unspoken
rule
of
putting
on
a
good
face
.
Rather
than
talking
openly
about
their
mental
health
,
Asian
Americans
are
taught
to
bury
their
feelings
.

All
of
this
makes
it
a
long
,
challenging
road
for
Asian
Americans
when
it
comes
to
seeking
mental
health
treatment
.
Years
of
being
taught
otherwise
is
hard
to
overcome
.
Even
just
opening
the
door
for
conversation
can
be
difficult
.
Efforts
to
promote
mental
health
awareness
in
Asian
communities
through
films
and
community
workshops
have
been
a
good
starting
point
.
However
,
it
remains
an
uphill
battle
to
unlearn
the
lessons
learned
from
our
parents
and
culture
.
We
often
speak
about
the
Duke
community
,
but
who
does
that
include
?
Students
,
faculty
,
administrators
and
Coach
K
are
certainly
part
of
it
.
But
this
list
fails
to
mention
the
people
who
enable
our
community
to
function
in
the
first
place
staff
.
The
people
who
work
in
dining
,
maintenance
,
and
transportation
are
just
as
dedicated
to
our
University
as
the
other
stakeholders
,
if
not
more
so
.
It’s
time
we
recognize
that
dedication
in
our
campus
programming
.
A
couple
weeks
ago
,
I
took
a
tour
of
the
Duke
Chapel
with
Oscar
Dantzler
,
the
buildings
custodian
for
over
two
decades
.
His
insight
was
fascinating
and
wide
ranging
,
from
the
intricacies
of
the
stained
glass
windows
to
his
experience
escorting
Mary
Duke
Semans
on
his
arm
.
He
has
been
featured
in
The
Philosopher
Kings
,
a
film
about
custodial
workers
on
university
campuses
across
the
country
,
and
was
awarded
the
University
Medal
,
Duke’s
highest
honor
for
distinguished
service
.
Oscar
is
just
one
of
the
amazing
staff
members
who
contributes
to
our
community
every
day
.
My
experiences
with
staff
have
enriched
my
Duke
experience
more
than
I
could
have
ever
imagined
.
From
the
breakfast
lines
at
Marketplace
freshman
year
to
the
hallways
of
West
campus
dorm
,
these
interactions
have
brightened
my
day
on
so
many
occasions
and
taught
me
things
I
never
would
have
learned
in
a
classroom
.
In
a
recent
column
entitled
Who’s
in
your
Duke
community
?
Bella
Miller
eloquently
conveys
the
immense
value
of
connecting
with
staff
and
how
special
these
relationships
can
become
.
Despite
constant
interactions
between
students
and
staff
,
it
seems
like
they
rarely
get
beyond
Hi
,
how
are
you
?
limiting
the
potential
for
meaningful
relationships
to
form
.
Fortunately
,
some
of
our
community’s
staff
members
are
engagement
all
stars
,
building
genuine
relationships
with
students
through
their
warmth
and
compassion
.
Big
Mike
is
a
shining
example
of
this
.
My
interactions
with
Big
Mike
began
during
late
night
CCX
rides
.
In
the
years
since
,
we
have
developed
a
close
bond
,
speaking
about
everything
from
our
weekend
plans
to
our
families
in
person
and
over
the
phone
.
When
I
saw
Big
Mike
for
the
first
time
this
year
riding
my
bike
,
he
stopped
the
bus
in
the
street
just
to
open
the
door
and
give
me
a
big
hug
.
Feeling
so
fortunate
for
this
friendship
,
I
want
to
create
more
opportunities
for
other
students
and
staff
to
experience
this
.
So
,
I
gave
Big
Mike
a
call
.
When
I
told
him
about
the
prospect
of
creating
a
program
to
help
facilitate
such
relationships
,
he
said
,
it
really
touches
my
heart
.
Everybody
brings
something
to
the
table
.
We
are
the
Duke
family
.
After
getting
his
insight
on
how
this
goal
could
be
most
effectively
achieved
,
I
realized
that
there’s
already
the
infrastructure
available
for
these
types
of
engagements
.
Not
only
would
Duke
Conversations
provide
students
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
staff
,
but
also
to
learn
from
them
.
Just
as
faculty
pre
determine
a
general
theme
for
the
discussion
,
staff
would
do
the
same
.
As
a
result
,
students
and
staff
would
identify
common
interests
,
serving
as
a
foundation
for
further
conversations
.
These
efforts
would
be
an
important
step
forward
in
creating
a
more
inclusive
and
welcoming
community
for
all
of
its
members
.
However
,
each
one
of
us
can
contribute
to
this
goal
in
our
daily
lives
.
We
can
engage
in
full
conversations
with
staff
rather
than
just
exchanging
formalities
.
It
will
brighten
their
days
while
providing
an
opportunity
to
learn
and
connect
.
And
who
knows
,
maybe
taking
the
initiative
on
this
may
lead
to
a
life
long
friendship
.
Near
the
end
of
my
most
recent
conversation
with
Big
Mike
,
he
said
I
love
my
Duke
students
and
staff
.
I
love
the
University
.
That
love
deserves
a
spotlight
in
our
campus
programs
from
everyday
conversations
to
Duke
Conversations
.
It’s
been
a
few
weeks
since
my
last
column
,
The
case
for
well
behaved
women
and
men
,
in
which
I
reflected
that
the
common
adage
,
well
behaved
women
seldom
make
history
,
should
give
us
pause
.
On
Twitter
,
my
peers
told
me
to
delete
myself
;
I
was
called
a
bootlicking
conservative
and
denounced
as
internally
misogynistic
;
I
was
ridiculed
as
having
written
probably
one
of
the
worst
things
the
chronicle
has
published
this
semester
;
I
was
asked
,
did
you
get
picked
?
Did
he
text
you
back
?
because
of
my
column’s
tagline
.
On
the
Chronicle’s
Facebook
page
Why
are
white
women
and
the
pick
me’s
are
out
in
full
force
today
.
From
the
comment
section
of
my
fellow
columnist’s
response
,
Misbehaving
makes
history
,
not
manners
81
likes
.
Not
excused
,
we
just
know
already
they
will
never
change
,
so
why
waste
any
energy
at
all
on
them
.
And
those
are
just
the
,
well
,
less
As
I
received
this
heat
from
which
I
never
expected
to
be
immune
,
I
struggled
to
heed
my
own
wisdom
.
My
reflection
that
a
disregard
for
well
behaved
ness
burden
s
human
interactions
with
coarseness
and
incites
in
us
the
impulse
to
return
insults
and
antipathy
in
kind
rang
true
.
These
commenters
denouncing
me
with
hateful
slurs
are
prejudiced
in
reading
into
my
column
their
own
misguided
,
uninformed
perceptions
of
me
and
my
background
,
I
instinctively
thought
.
.
As
such
,
these
rules
are
not
infallible
and
inerrant
in
their
creation
or
enforcement
,
and
never
especially
not
in
my
previous
column
did
I
claim
them
to
be
otherwise
.
Instead
,
we
must
realize
that
,
just
as
we
humans
fall
short
in
our
own
aims
and
aspirations
towards
the
Truth
and
justice
,
so
,
too
,
do
those
traditions
and
conventions
we
create
.
Therefore
,
we
must
examine
and
be
discerning
of
those
customs
of
supposed
good
behavior
we
inherit
and
in
which
we
take
part
.
If
our
rules
of
well
mannered
ness
apply
unequally
to
humans
men
,
women
,
black
,
white
and
everywhere
in
between
inherently
equal
in
dignity
and
worth
,
we
should
violate
them
.
If
they
perpetuate
injustice
and
oppression
,
we
should
violate
them
.
If
they
delight
in
evil
,
or
call
good
evil
and
evil
good
,
we
should
violate
them
.
This
point
I
attempted
to
make
clear
by
admiring
the
pursuit
of
the
Truth
and
justice
which
the
likes
of
Rosa
Parks
,
Harriet
Tubman
and
the
American
patriots
embodied
in
defying
societal
molds
of
well
behaved
ness
which
perpetuated
injustice
and
slavery
in
its
many
forms
.
nbsp
;
Secondly
instead
of
,
glorify
ing
defiance
and
vilify
ing
well
mannered
ness
,
we
should
lament
the
fact
that
our
standards
of
well
mannered
behavior
do
not
truly
promote
well
mannered
ness
,
that
they
flout
the
Truth
and
justice
while
advancing
evil
and
injustice
.
We
should
grieve
a
world
in
which
we
,
in
order
to
abide
by
the
Truth
and
justice
,
must
bear
the
mark
of
impoliteness
of
being
ill
mannered
and
ill
behaved
.
By
carrying
the
name
of
rule
breaker
,
in
this
way
,
we
should
call
attention
to
the
usurpation
of
our
code
of
behavior
by
those
who
pervert
our
rules
for
their
unjust
ends
.
Thirdly
be
what
my
peer
calls
rebels
,
rabble
rousers
and
revolutionaries
.
Yet
,
we
,
painted
as
radicals
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
uphold
an
narrow
minded
and
stifling
,
should
not
pursue
the
Truth
and
justice
should
not
seek
to
reform
by
using
the
very
unjust
,
impolite
means
with
which
we
were
met
.
Contrary
to
my
peer’s
call
to
reject
societ
al
demands
that
we
take
the
high
road
and
ignore
the
rudeness
without
returning
it
in
kind
,
we
should
we
do
the
opposite
if
we
hope
to
achieve
the
greatest
fulfillment
of
our
end
.
We
must
not
meet
belittl
ing
with
belittling
.
We
must
not
dismiss
as
we
are
dismissed
.
We
must
not
insult
our
insulters
.
It
is
this
very
ethic
of
good
will
,
of
unconditional
love
that
embodying
the
truest
meaning
of
what
it
means
to
be
well
behaved
,
polite
,
kind
,
gracious
which
the
most
radical
,
change
making
,
rule
breaking
people
in
the
history
of
the
world
have
embraced
.
The
Reverend
Dr
.
Martin
Luther
King
,
Jr
.
with
whom
I
share
a
faith
stands
foremost
among
these
revolutionaries
who
pursued
the
Truth
and
justice
with
undying
good
will
towards
everyone
from
his
neighbor
to
his
oppressor
.
It
was
he
who
called
his
fellow
man
wrangling
against
racial
injustice
to
be
an
extremist
for
love
,
truth
,
and
goodness
,
to
rise
above
our
environment
,
and
to
bear
against
those
evils
by
the
forces
of
goodwill
,
in
the
same
way
that
we
must
be
unconditionally
good
willed
to
be
knowledge
about
him
or
her
.
And
it
is
this
sort
of
pervasive
ill
will
that
multiplies
the
existence
of
violence
and
bitterness
in
the
universe
.
Instead
,
we
must
not
glorify
rule
breaking
for
rule
breaking’s
sake
.
We
should
lament
that
our
rules
are
imperfect
and
unjust
,
and
then
seek
to
reform
them
make
history
.
I
wish
for
that
world
.
I
hope
you
would
,
too
.
Picture
this
it’s
2
a
.
m
.
on
a
Saturday
and
you’re
chest
deep
in
the
rabbit
hole
of
Modern
Love
.
You’re
a
little
upset
because
,
yes
,
it’s
cuffing
season
,
and
no
,
you’re
not
cuffed
.
So
you’re
living
vicariously
through
the
stories
of
other
people
but
sometimes
it
hurts
to
be
reading
these
beautiful
love
fragments
and
knowing
that
they
cannot
and
will
not
and
do
not
apply
to
you
.
And
then
you
stumble
upon
another
tidbit
of
romantic
news
an
engagement
!
Between
a
woman
named
Katie
Waldman
and
none
other
than
Stephen
Miller
.
nbsp
;
I’ll
admit
it
this
may
have
been
my
Saturday
night
.
The
phone
nearly
gave
me
a
black
eye
after
I
dropped
it
on
my
face
upon
seeing
the
news
.
I
may
have
broken
down
over
my
fourth
triple
shot
espresso
of
the
evening
.
The
article
just
couldn’t
be
true
.
Stephen
Miller
is
the
punchline
of
my
family
dinners
.
My
sister
will
tease
The
idea
that
Stephen
Miller
had
found
love
tore
me
through
a
quick
pattern
of
quasi
grief
denial
,
anger
,
sadness
.
I
wanted
to
sprint
out
of
my
dorm
and
run
halfway
to
Swift
Avenue
in
the
32
degree
wind
chill
weather
and
scream
Stephen
F
ing
Miller
found
love
,
and
I
can’t
?
from
the
bridge
across
the
underlit
highway
.
But
I
couldn’t
.
I
wanted
to
find
closure
,
but
I
couldn’t
.
So
I
had
to
move
onto
the
fourth
stage
acceptance
.
Maybe
I
did
not
even
need
to
write
another
opinion
article
criticizing
this
University
,
because
the
fact
that
Duke
seemingly
taught
this
monster
to
disguise
himself
as
personable
in
order
to
find
a
potential
partner
is
criticism
enough
.
It
makes
sense
now
why
the
Blue
Devil
is
white
.
Duke
was
doing
its
due
diligence
;
Stephen
Miller
was
behind
the
mask
all
along
.
Acceptance
,
to
me
,
also
meant
setting
a
few
facts
straight
.
You
,
Stephen
Miller
are
a
white
nationalist
,
yes
.
And
,
by
my
decree
as
a
Jewish
Duke
undergrad
,
you
are
expelled
from
our
community
.
The
Jews
don’t
want
you
.
We
never
did
.
Your
bubbe
would
be
flipping
around
in
her
grave
if
she
knew
you
hated
people
now
who
would
have
been
your
family
less
than
a
century
ago
.
You
backed
immigration
policies
Hitler
once
praised
.
journalism
like
all
of
our
worst
nightmares
,
duh
,
believing
that
Modern
Love
applied
to
her
life
too
.
But
Katie
Waldman
is
Mike
Pence’s
press
secretary
,
at
the
center
of
a
few
scandals
herself
,
and
has
used
overly
racist
rhetoric
to
describe
migrants
in
the
past
.
She
may
be
dating
Miller
for
political
reasons
I
mean
,
c’mon
would
ever
swipe
right
,
but
she
knows
exactly
what
she’s
doing
.
So
where
does
all
of
this
leave
me
an
uncuffed
,
messy
,
over
caffeinated
college
girl
navigating
Duke
,
as
Stephen
Miller
once
did
?
He
could
have
sat
at
this
exact
table
in
Vondy
,
where
I’m
writing
this
article
now
.
I’d
vomit
over
my
tenth
shot
of
espresso
.
I’m
not
sure
.
I
do
know
a
few
things
,
though
.
I
know
that
whatever
Stephen
Miller
has
cannot
be
equated
to
finding
love
.
Love
is
deep
,
selfless
,
and
all
encompassing
;
Miller
lacks
the
ability
to
see
an
inch
beyond
his
inflated
yet
deeply
insecure
ego
.
Love
is
trust
,
passion
,
and
empathy
;
Miller
possesses
none
.
Miller
has
harmed
tens
of
thousands
of
people
in
immeasurable
ways
.
He
has
dehumanized
,
displaced
,
and
oppressed
.
Love
will
never
,
ever
be
a
word
in
his
dictionary
.

I

I

and

I
have
loved
.
At
2
a
.
m
.
on
that
Saturday
,
I
told
myself
to
put
my
phone
down
.
I
told
myself
to
throw
away
the
half
empty
latte
and
pull
up
the
covers
.
The
most
evil
,
despicable
people
in
our
country
are
really
just
people
,
too
.
They
are
defeatable
.
And
we
can
find
love
.
Last
week
,
James
Davis
,
the
director
of
the
Duke
Smoking
Cessation
Program
,
proposed
that
Duke
extend
its
soon
to
be
implemented
smoking
ban
to
include
electronic
cigarettes
.
In
its
present
condition
,
the
smoke
free
campus
initiative
will
only
prohibit
combustible
tobacco
products
,
such
as
cigars
and
cigarettes
,
and
does
not
regulate
nbsp
;
the
use
of
e
cigarettes
.
As
some
readers
of
this
publication
might
remember
,
I
am
also
an
opponent
of
Duke’s
general
smoking
ban
,
and
I
think
some
of
the
arguments
are
transferable
to
this
issue
.
The
science
and
policy
surrounding
e
cigarettes
is
vast
and
complex
,
but
I
think
that
Duke
should
take
a
step
back
before
engaging
in
such
drastic
policy
that
may
have
broader
unintended
consequences
.
It
is
worth
mentioning
that
Dr
.
Davis’
suggestions
strongly
echo
the
direction
of
national
policy
.
Just
last
Friday
,
President
Trump
suggested
that
the
United
States
may
move
to
raise
the
minimum
age
to
purchase
vaping
products
to
21
.
The
administration
is
also
moving
to
prohibit
the
sale
of
flavored
e
cigarette
products
.
This
,
of
course
,
lags
behind
more
proscriptive
legislation
in
other
countries
,
which
have
included
full
scale
vaping
bans
.
Opponents
of
vaping
point
to
several
arguments
to
bolster
their
case
.
One
of
the
most
commonly
cited
arguments
against
e
cigarette
use
concerns
the
addictive
qualities
of
nicotine
,
and
how
it
affects
non
smokers
who
may
be
drawn
to
seemingly
harmless
e
cigarettes
and
quickly
find
themselves
hooked
on
the
substance
.

also
mentioned
that
,
given
how
new
the
vaping
phenomenon
is
to
America
,
there
is
little
in
the
way
of
long
term
evidence
that
could
possibly
provide
conclusive
information
relating
to
the
health
effects
of
e
cigarette
usage
.
While
e
cigarette
products
have
been
on
the
market
in
the
United
States
since
2007
,
it
wasn’t
until
Juul
which
now
holds
72
of
the
e
cigarette
market
hit
the
shelves
a
few
years
ago
that
they
became
widespread
.
The
recent
wave
of
vaping
related
illnesses
has
struck
fear
into
the
hearts
of
regulators
and
consumers
alike
.
Dr
.
Davis
points
to
the
uptick
in
Lung
Injury
Syndrome
to
justify
a
campus
wide
ban
on
e
cigarettes
.
I
am
not
going
to
deny
that
there
are
several
health
hazards
associated
with
vaping
,
and
Dr
.
Davis
documents
many
of
these
.
However
,
I
don’t
think
it’s
unreasonable
to
express
some
skepticism
at
a
proposal
as
radical
as
a
full
scale
prohibition
on
the
usage
of
e
cigarettes
.
It
is
worth
referring
back
to
a
recent
letter
to
The
Chronicle
by
a
group
called
the
Concerned
Tobacco
Addiction
Treatment
and
Policy
Experts
,
which
includes
several
physicians
employed
by
Duke
University
.
Their
understanding
of
the
literature
reinforces
the
consensus
that
vaping
is
far
less
dangerous
than
smoking
cigarettes
,
as
studies
of
e
cigarette
users
have
shown
that
they
take
in
far
less
toxins
than
cigarette
smokers
.
As
the
smoking
ban
inches
closer
,
students
and
employees
of
Duke
that
are
addicted
to
nicotine
may
be
forced
to
find
other
alternatives
,
such
as
nicotine
replacement
therapy
,
which
is
,
as
these
experts
discuss
,
about
as
effective
as
e
cigarettes
in
helping
smokers
quit
their
habits
.
Furthermore
,
there
is
a
growing
body
of
evidence
that
suggests
that
much
of
the
recent
ruckus
surrounding
vaping
related
illness
can
be
traced
back
to
vitamin
E
acetate
,
which
is
used
to
treat
cannabis
extracts
for
vapes
,
the
legal
,
nicotine
vapes
that
would
also
be
subject
to
this
ban
.
In
fact
,
86
percent
of
patients
reported
consuming
cannabis
through
their
vapes
,
and
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
the
actual
percentage
was
higher
than
this
.
There
is
a
strong
argument
that
Duke
should
minimize
its
interference
in
the
freedom
of
its
students
and
employees
to
make
choices
related
to
their
personal
health
.
The
members
of
the
Duke
community
that
will
be
affected
by
this
ban
are
adults
with
the
autonomy
and
intelligence
to
make
decisions
about
themselves
consistent
with
their
own
long
term
interests
.
The
bureaucratization
of
the
lifestyle
choices
of
its
students
should
concern
everyone
,
as
it
is
a
logic
that
can
be
employed
to
exercise
further
and
more
restrictive
policies
against
the
student
body
.
In
,
historian
and
Duke
Divinity
professor
Kate
Bowler
describes
what
it
was
like
to
be
diagnosed
with
Stage
IV
colon
cancer
at
the
age
of
35
.
She
writes
clearly
and
honestly
about
living
in
the
liminal
space
between
wellness
and
illness
,
love
and
suffering
,
life
and
death
.
Her
whole
book
is
excellent
,
but
as
a
fervent
member
of
the
Kate
Bowler
fan
club
,
I
can
name
off
the
top
of
my
head
the
part
of
her
book
that
resonated
with
me
most
right
at
the
end
,
when
she
gives
a
list
of
things
to
say
and
things
not
to
say
to
people
who
are
suffering
.
People
with
chronic
pain
know
all
too
well
what
it’s
like
to
be
in
conversation
with
well
intentioned
people
who
don’t
know
what
to
say
.
We
know
what
words
feel
good
,
and
what
words
make
us
want
to
punch
a
hole
in
a
wall
somewhere
.
So
,
wonderful
,
well
intentioned
people
who
don’t
know
what
to
say
to
a
friend
or
acquaintance
who
has
chronic
pain
here
is
a
helpful
cheat
sheet
!
A
disclaimer
you
should
go
to
the
library
,
check
out
the
book
,
and
read
it
all
the
way
to
the
end
.
That
way
,
you
can
see
how
much
I
lightly
,
reverently
borrow
from
some
of
the
following
recommendations
!
I
know
,
I
know
.
What
could
we
possibly
say
to
our
acquaintances
in
line
in
Vondy
if
we
don’t
ask
them
how
they
are
?
I
can’t
count
the
number
of
times
I
have
said
,
Great
!
Fine
!
Doing
amazing
!
and
been
in
intense
pain
when
I
said
it
.
Even
when
I
can
tell
that
someone
is
asking
how
I’m
doing
the
way
people
do
when
they
know
you
might
not
be
okay
you
know
,
how
are
you
in
bed
.
Please
,
come
bring
me
pizza
and
hug
me
and
maybe
sit
on
my
bed
and
talk
about
Anne
Hathaway
with
me
?
I
would
love
that
.
A
couple
of
weeks
ago
I
was
watching
the
Democratic
debate
.
As
usual
,
I
saw
the
oft
made
plans
for
universal
healthcare
and
a
variety
of
new
welfare
programs
such
as
Universal
Basic
Income
UBI
.
What
really
struck
me
,
however
,
was
Elizabeth
Warren’s
consistent
failure
to
respond
to
claims
made
by
her
fellow
Democrats
that
her
spending
plans
were
not
feasible
without
raising
taxes
.
Fundamentally
,
the
federal
government
has
consistently
failed
to
balance
the
budget
over
the
last
couple
decades
,
resulting
in
massive
increases
in
debt
.
Governments
maintain
balanced
budgets
when
their
revenue
exceeds
their
expenses
.
However
,
governments
can
avoid
balancing
their
budgets
when
debt
can
be
issued
to
pay
off
excess
expenses
.
Many
governments
recognize
this
is
not
sustainable
.
Nearly
every
US
state
has
some
sort
of
stipulation
requiring
a
balanced
budget
.
Nevertheless
,
the
federal
government
has
never
had
such
restrictions
on
its
ability
to
run
a
budget
deficit
.
Federal
deficits
have
run
in
the
hundreds
of
billions
for
the
past
several
decades
.
Indeed
,
the
last
year
we
had
a
balanced
budget
was
2001
.
Fundamentally
,
this
problem
is
caused
by
excessive
spending
and
tax
decreases
.
The
spending
part
is
obvious
.
When
the
Congress
increases
spending
it
is
often
politically
difficult
to
raise
taxes
.
This
is
why
Warren
refuses
to
answer
how
she
would
pay
for
her
policy
proposals
.
If
implemented
,
these
policies
will
likely
be
paid
for
through
taking
on
more
debt
.
Since
taxes
are
politically
undesirable
,
the
most
feasible
way
to
account
for
new
expenses
is
through
debt
.
George
W
.
Bush
realized
this
during
the
Wars
in
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
.
Although
these
wars
cost
billions
,
the
Bush
administration
lowered
taxes
instead
of
raising
them
.
This
combination
of
tax
cuts
and
war
kept
support
high
on
both
the
foreign
policy
and
economic
front
.
This
was
of
course
paid
for
through
more
debt
.
Although
issuing
more
debt
may
not
have
been
the
best
long
term
option
,
it
was
certainly
the
most
politically
feasible
.
This
brings
us
to
a
more
recent
example
the
Trump
tax
cuts
.
Fundamentally
,
I
support
any
tax
cuts
,
and
Trump
did
an
excellent
job
in
lowering
corporate
tax
rates
although
there
were
some
problems
with
changes
in
rules
on
income
tax
deductions
.
Roughly
speaking
,
Trump’s
tax
cuts
nbsp
;
decreased
government
revenue
by
close
to
275
billion
in
2018
,
not
taking
into
account
the
increase
in
economic
growth
caused
by
the
tax
cuts
.
While
275
billion
is
a
great
number
to
start
with
in
terms
of
tax
decreases
,
it
is
necessary
to
also
decrease
spending
to
correspond
to
the
lower
revenue
.
However
,
this
is
also
politically
undesirable
.
Just
as
raising
taxes
is
unpopular
,
so
too
is
decreasing
spending
.
Some
constituency
will
inevitably
lose
out
from
a
spending
cut
and
they
could
be
a
key
group
in
a
battleground
state
.
Accordingly
,
tax
cuts
,
just
like
increases
in
spending
,
are
often
paid
for
through
debt
.
To
end
,
I
will
share
the
per
person
value
of
the
American
national
debt
.
The
figure
is
69
,
458
.
That’s
69
,
458
for
every
man
,
woman
,
and
child
in
the
country
.
Now
ask
yourself
,
is
it
fair
to
saddle
future
generations
with
such
a
burden
for
the
sake
of
political
desirability
?

While
it
is
critical
to
hold
candidates
accountable
for
their
spending
plans
and
ensure
they
are
rational
and
sustainable
,
holding
candidates
to
the
standard
of
a
balanced
budget
is
,
at
best
,
impractical
and
,
at
worst
,
a
great
obstacle
to
growth
.
nbsp
;
A
balanced
budget
is
far
from
the
global
standard
of
national
budgets
.
nbsp
;
According
to
the
CIA
,
in
2017
,
out
of
222
countries
,
only
41
had
balanced
budgets
or
budgets
with
surpluses
.
nbsp
;
Furthermore
,
the
vast
majority
of
the
countries
in
this
category
were
smaller
or
less
developed
nations
with
smaller
,
easier
to
balance
budgets
.
nbsp
;
The
US
is
clearly
not
alone
in
its
decision
to
engage
in
deficit
spending
.
If
,
as
Stephen
says
,
not
maintaining
a
balanced
budget
is
failing
,
then
72
of
the
world
is
failing
.
While
debt
,
for
many
,
is
a
frightening
enigma
,
retaining
a
certain
amount
of
debt
,
on
both
a
personal
and
national
level
,
is
a
healthy
practice
.
nbsp
;
The
average
US
household
has
132
,
529
in
debt
,
much
of
which
is
from
mortgages
.
nbsp
;
This
seems
like
a
frighteningly
large
number
,
but
,
for
most
people
,
this
debt
is
sustainable
and
allows
them
to
further
themselves
financially
in
ways
that
would
not
be
possible
without
healthy
debt
.
nbsp
;
The
same
is
true
for
the
debt
accrued
by
a
national
government
.
nbsp
;
Deficit
spending
allows
the
government
to
build
credit
with
other
nations
,
maintain
alliances
,
and
build
up
its
infrastructure
and
support
programs
.
nbsp
;
Without
it
,
as
can
be
seen
by
the
effect
of
Germany’s
debt
brake
a
national
policy
which
requires
the
country
to
run
a
budget
with
a
deficit
of
no
more
than
0
.
35
of
GDP
on
the
country’s
infrastructure
,
growth
halts
.
When
you
boil
it
down
,
a
balanced
budget
can
be
achieved
by
decreasing
spending
,
increasing
revenue
from
taxes
,
or
some
combination
thereof
.
nbsp
;
Accordingly
,
the
265
billion
decrease
in
tax
revenue
caused
by
Trump’s
tax
cuts
clearly
do
not
bring
the
U
.
S
.
any
closer
to
the
goal
of
a
balanced
budget
though
I
argue
this
should
not
be
the
goal
in
the
first
place
.
nbsp
;
To
require
the
nation
to
maintain
a
balanced
budget
is
to
ignore
that
economies
move
in
cycles
.
nbsp
;
There
may
be
years
in
which
maintaining
a
balanced
budget
is
practical
,
but
there
are
certainly
years
where
it
is
harmful
.
nbsp
;
Since
recessions
result
in
decreased
income
,
and
therefore
decreased
revenue
from
taxes
,
a
balanced
budget
would
require
the
government
to
decrease
spending
during
recessions
,
which
would
exacerbate
the
effects
of
downturns
on
individuals
and
corporations
alike
.
At
the
end
of
the
day
,
deficit
spending
is
a
government’s
way
of
investing
in
itself
.
nbsp
;
If
we
are
interested
in
remaining
an
economically
competitive
nation
that
supports
its
citizens
,
we
must
be
willing
to
invest
in
ourselves
.
nbsp
;
While
there
is
,
of
course
,
a
point
where
deficit
spending
is
unsustainable
,
it
is
highly
unlikely
the
US
has
reached
that
point
.
In
2017
,
the
nation
clocked
in
at
131
of
222
countries
in
terms
of
budget
balance
revenue
or
deficit
as
a
percentage
of
GDP
.
nbsp
;
Falling
in
the
59th
percentile
,
the
US’s
deficit
spending
practices
are
arguably
as
normal
as
you’ll
find
.
nbsp
;
It
is
true
that
normal
practices
are
not
inherently
the
best
practices
,
but
in
the
case
of
government
spending
,
countries
have
had
hundreds
to
thousands
of
years
to
reach
a
proper
equilibrium
,
and
the
US’s
spending
falls
near
that
equilibrium
point
.
nbsp
;
There
is
no
indication
that
there
is
genuine
cause
for
concern
in
our
imbalanced
budget
.
Finally
,
to
consider
the
per
person
value
of
the
American
national
debt
alone
is
misleading
.
nbsp
;
While
that
figure
is
69
,
458
,
no
individual
American
will
ever
be
asked
to
cough
up
that
value
at
any
time
or
over
the
course
of
any
time
period
.
nbsp
;
In
contrast
,
the
average
earner
pays
355
,
366
in
taxes
in
a
lifetime
.
nbsp
;
Regardless
of
your
stance
on
tax
increases
,
it
is
clear
from
these
numbers
that
,
if
reducing
or
capping
the
debt
became
a
strong
national
interest
,
it
could
be
done
through
raising
taxes
.
There
is
more
than
meets
the
eye
to
numerical
measurements
of
debt
,
and
we
would
do
well
not
to
fear
them
without
doing
research
into
their
meaning
.
nbsp
;
While
a
balanced
budget
sounds
like
a
clean
solution
to
a
big
problem
,
it
is
not
a
solution
,
the
problem
is
not
big
,
and
the
problem
is
not
a
problem
.
Imagine
if
during
his
time
at
Duke
,
Zion
Williamson
could
sell
his
own
shoes
.
I
,
along
with
the
tens
of
thousands
of
crazed
Duke
fans
,
would
buy
and
proudly
wear
them
.
Without
signing
any
professional
team
contracts
and
remaining
a
Duke
student
,
Zion
would
have
millions
of
dollars
to
his
name
.
The
NCAA’s
recent
decision
allowing
athletes
to
profit
from
their
name
,
image
,
and
likeness
might
make
this
scenario
possible
in
the
future
.
The
ruling
is
a
result
of
pressure
from
a
California
law
Fair
Play
,
Fair
Pay
passed
earlier
this
year
that
gave
NCAA
athletes
in
the
state
the
same
freedoms
.
Changes
to
the
policy
will
go
into
effect
by
January
2021
after
each
sports
division
discusses
and
develops
more
specific
rules
.
Despite
the
lack
of
clarity
concerning
how
athletes
might
benefit
,
the
ruling’s
message
is
clear
.
Student
athletes
should
not
be
pawns
for
institutional
benefits
.
They
deserve
to
retain
the
freedom
to
benefit
from
their
success
.
To
say
that
I
was
shocked
at
the
NCAA’s
decision
would
be
an
understatement
.
The
NCAA
notoriously
uses
its
power
to
give
athletes’
incoming
money
and
fame
to
their
respective
institutions
.
Under
previous
NCAA
amateurism
rules
,
schools
benefited
at
the
expense
of
athletes
.
Too
often
,
the
institutions
win
.
If
anything
,
I
thought
that
the
NCAA
would
oppose
down
the
rule
in
California
.
Maybe
that
is
why
I
am
excited
about
the
new
rule
and
conversations
about
athlete
freedoms
.
Maybe
college
athletics
will
see
more
money
in
the
hands
of
players
.
Maybe
more
successful
athletes
will
finish
school
.
From
a
gender
equality
standpoint
,
some
might
argue
that
the
rule
favors
men’s
basketball
and
football
.
While
I
do
not
doubt
the
greater
attention
and
profit
available
in
those
sports
,
allowing
female
athletes
to
profit
from
their
likeness
is
a
bigger
deal
.
Former
UCLA
gymnast
Kaitlyn
Ohashi
affirms
this
idea
in
her
endorsement
of
the
changes

From

Ohashi

Her
words
made
me
think
of
all
the
female
athletes
at
the
peak
of
their
career
while
college
age
.
Athletes
with
the
opportunity
to
compete
at
the
professional
level
while
college
age
such
as
Simone
Biles
,
Aly
Raisman
,
or
Venus
Williams
cannot
simultaneously
receive
money
and
play
college
sports
.
Many
women
are
at
the
top
of
their
sport
in
terms
of
success
and
fame
during
their
college
years
.
Compared
to
men’s
sports
,
money
in
women’s
professional
sports
might
as
well
be
pennies
in
a
bucket
.
Arguably
,
college
represents
the
best
time
for
female
athletes
to
profit
.
There
are
,
however
,
nbsp
;
a
variety
of
potential
problems
with
allowing
athletes
to
profit
from
their
names
.
This
is
particularly
true
nbsp
;
in
women’s
sports
,
where
social
media
platforms
like
Instagram
,
can
promote
an
oversexualization
of
female
athletes
.
Sports
resembles
a
meritocracy
in
that
wins
and
losses
measure
success
.
.
Thus
,
using
female
athletes’
body
image
in
college
as
a
means
of
income
is
frustrating
.
Is
more
attention
to
and
money
in
female
college
athletics
worth
potential
objectification
?
In
my
conversations
with
Duke
athletes
about
the
ramifications
of
the
ruling
,
the
divide
in
takeaways
was
stark
.
Football
players
expressed
excitement
over
the
ability
to
make
money
.

Wait
for
me
to
develop
my
Instagram
platform
said
football
player
Dewayne
Carter
.
I
am
about
to
bring
in
the
cash
.
On
the
other
hand
,
players
in
sports
like
tennis
,
field
hockey
,
and
track
and
field
almost
dismissed
the
ruling
,
arguing
that
it
had
no
significant
impact
on
minor
sports
.
nbsp
;
I
guess
the
new
rule
is
good
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
this
rule
is
for
men’s
football
and
basketball
said
tennis
player
Chloe
Beck
.
As
a
track
and
field
athlete
,
I
have
no
intention
of
profiting
from
my
name
or
image
while
at
Duke
.
The
feasibility
of
making
money
from
my
sport
in
college
is
so
small
,
especially
compared
to
money
in
campus
jobs
or
summer
opportunities
.
At
the
same
time
,
I
cannot
dismiss
the
impact
and
importance
of
such
a
rule
simply
because
I
have
little
stake
.
I
am
eager
to
see
people
like
Skylar
Diggins
or
Kaitlin
Ohashai
in
years
to
come
earn
money
from
what
is
essentially
a
job
.
This
rule
was
not
meant
to
disempower
institutions
but
to
give
athletes
more
freedom
.
Before
we
all
get
too
excited
,
new
ruling
raises
more
questions
than
anyone
can
answer
at
this
point
.
What
if
Zion
could
have
become
a
millionaire
at
Duke
?
Would
he
have
stayed
?
I
find
that
people
often
avoid
the
conversation
about
money
in
sports
.
My
challenge
to
the
NCAA
and
leaders
in
this
effort
is
to
allow
the
change
in
ruling
create
open
dialogue
for
how
money
in
college
athletics
can
be
ethically
earned
and
distributed
.

One
of
the
best
text
messages
I’ve
received
this
year
came
from
my
RA
.
He
wrote
my
floor
GroupMe
,
Guys
,
I
just
want
to
emphasize
bathroom
cleanliness
someone
is
constantly
urinating
on
the
toilet
seats
.
I
enjoyed
it
so
much
because
it
urgently
needed
to
be
said
.
And
because
before
that
message
,
I
couldn’t
figure
out
if
everyone
else
just
took
it
as
an
unavoidable
fact
of
existence
that
there
would
be
urine
on
the
toilet
seat
in
the
men’s
bathroom
now
and
forever
.
The
problem
has
predictably
persisted
and
the
number
of
stalls
hit
in
conjunction
with
the
amount
of
urine
makes
it
clear
that
a
concerningly
large
contingency
is
at
fault
.
The
most
obvious
read
of
the
situation
is
that
some
guys
boys
are
too
lazy
and
too
arrogant
to
bother
lifting
up
the
toilet
seat
.
I
think
there’s
more
to
it
though
.
The
seat
is
simply
too
easy
to
lift
and
failure
too
incessant
for
laziness
and
arrogance
to
tell
the
whole
story
.
In
contemplating
this
situation
and
two
others
from
typical
daily
life
at
Duke
,
I’ve
come
to
see
common
masculinity
at
Duke
as
troubled
and
indeed
comical
.
I
will
leave
quintessential
toxic
masculinity’
aside
,
opting
to
explore
the
subtler
though
no
less
pervasive
aspects
of
what
I
think
characterizes
masculinity
here
at
Duke
.
Back
to
the
seat
peeing
,
though
,
I
have
two
explanations
to
offer
that
are
at
least
as
important
as
laziness
and
arrogance
.
First
,
men
want
to
experience
their
power
,
and
leaving
the
residue
of
their
urine
on
toilet
seats
helps
them
achieve
this
.
Whenever
I
notice
the
tell
tale
signs
of
a
peed
on
toilet
seat
I
imagine
my
predecessor
looking
down
at
the
drops
of
yellow
he
has
left
behind
and
thinking
smugly
to
himself
,
Ha
!
Yes
!
I
can
affect
the
world
!
I
claim
space
every
time
I
pee
!
In
this
way
,
peeing
on
the
seat
is
the
natural
extension
of
the
masculine
tendency
to
sit
in
the
most
space
consumptive
positions
imaginable
.
Second
,
men
convince
themselves
of
their
fertility
by
peeing
on
the
seats
.
I
generally
find
the
fear
of
fertility
surprisingly
ubiquitous
and
one
of
the
most
obvious
indicators
of
the
deep
insecurity
embedded
within
masculinity
.
So
even
if
peeing
on
the
seat
seems
an
awfully
circuitous
way
of
convincing
oneself
of
one’s
fertility
,
we
should
not
underestimate
the
insecure
man
.
Toilet
seats
are
not
the
only
places
I’ve
noticed
Duke
men
taking
up
space
.
There
is
the
other
classic
instance
when
a
large
ish
man
begins
walking
forward
in
a
crowded
area
while
looking
over
his
shoulder
talking
to
his
friend
,
embarking
on
a
blind
march
into
the
crowd
and
forcing
pedestrians
to
swerve
sideways
in
their
paths
.
I
always
want
to
bump
into
these
guys
boys
and
don’t
,
but
more
on
that
later
.
When
I
first
saw
this
,
I
laughed
to
myself
,
shocked
at
their
obliviousness
to
their
own
rudeness
.
I’ve
decided
,
though
,
that
they
can’t
be
oblivious
.
Too
many
times
they
must
have
bumped
into
people
or
at
least
realized
they
almost
did
.
Again
,
instead
of
mere
obliviousness
,
I
think
that
these
men
are
looking
for
roundabout
ways
to
experience
power
.
And
what
better
way
to
do
so
than
walking
forward
without
looking
on
a
sidewalk
and
knowing
that
nothing
bad
will
happen
.
Or
,
if
a
bump
does
occur
,
knowing
that
their
physicality
will
protect
them
.
More
subtly
,
but
no
less
significantly
,
I
suspect
that
they
are
also
longing
for
a
bump
.
There
is
a
great
scene
in
where
the
unnamed
male
narrator
tries
and
fails
multiple
times
to
bump
shoulders
with
a
socially
superior
man
who
always
hogs
the
sidewalk
.
And
then
,
in
a
shocking
act
of
courage
,
the
narrator
bumps
into
the
man
.
After
this
crucial
bump
,
the
narrator
is
sent
into
self
described
ecstasy
and
starts
singing
Italian
arias
,
even
though
he
bears
the
worst
of
the
bump
.
My
professor’s
read
of
this
scene
is
that
it
is
the
true
sexual
encounter
of
the
novel
,
and
I
have
to
say
that
I’m
convinced
.
Which
leads
me
to
see
these
men
talking
over
their
shoulder
as
they
walk
forward
as
similarly
longing
for
a
bump
and
maybe
a
bump
with
a
man
!
Which
makes
me
wonder
if
a
random
sidewalk
bump
this
the
only
way
for
these
men
to
have
physical
contact
with
another
man
?
My
final
anecdote
,
following
right
in
line
,
is
the
double
dude
moped
rides
where
the
man
in
the
back
refuses
to
hold
onto
the
man
in
front
.
To
my
eye
,
this
is
first
and
foremost
a
major
safety
risk
.
Though
I
must
admit
that
when
I
see
this
scene
I
always
secretly
hope
that
the
man
on
the
back
of
the
scooter
falls
off
as
the
two
go
around
a
tight
corner
.
But
anyways
,
being
so
averse
to
holding
onto
another
man
that
you
forgo
your
own
personal
comfort
and
safety
can
only
indicate
a
troubled
psyche
.
With
few
exceptions
,
someone
who
is
actually
secure
in
their
sexuality
would
have
no
problem
holding
onto
another
person
,
regardless
of
gender
.
It
must
be
that
there
is
such
a
social
or
personal
fear
of
seeming
queer
that
men
don’t
make
physical
contact
even
with
it
makes
absolute
situational
success
.
Either
that
or
they
are
simply
so
unused
to
touching
other
men
that
they
don’t
know
how
to
begin
.
It’s
no
wonder
they
are
longing
to
bump
into
someone
on
the
sidewalk
as
that
would
be
a
blameless
way
to
initiate
man
man
contact
,
a
mere
accident
.
My
conclusion
from
thinking
about
all
this
is
that
many
masc
cis
men
here
at
Duke
have
a
lot
to
gain
from
some
queer
exploration
!
Let
us
review
the
desires
indicated
and
how
they
might
be
aided
by
queer
exploration
.

First
in
terms
of
their
ever
expanding
desire
for
power
gay
sexual
encounters
can
help
teach
those
seat
peers
and
walking
without
looking
ers
to
accept
physical
control
from
another
and
learn
to
let
go
of
their
constant
need
for
power
.
To
be
fair
,
there
is
power
in
submission
and
non
masc
and
non
man
people
can
obviously
be
sexually
dominant
,
but
the
point
stands
.
Second
,
and
similarly
,
what
better
way
to
accept
infertility
than
to
enjoy
sexuality
without
the
remote
possibility
of
impregnating
someone
.
Thirdly
,
if
a
bump
into
another
dude
on
the
sidewalk
would
bring
pleasure
,
imagine
an
actually
honest
expression
of
one’s
sexual
urges
!
And
finally
,
some
baseline
contact
touching
other
men
would
hopefully
lead
to
being
able
to
hold
onto
the
person
in
front
of
you
on
a
moped
,
a
real
win
for
safety
at
Duke
.
This
past
week
,
Duke
University
hosted
Duke
Energy
Week
,
a
week
that
brings
students
,
faculty
,
and
industry
professionals
together
for
a
week
of
energy
events
to
promote
collaboration
,
knowledge
sharing
,
and
professional
networking
.
One
might
assume
that
,
given
the
grave
and
worrisome
series
of
climate
disasters
currently
unfolding
,
the
week
might
focus
on
the
global
relationship
of
energy
to
climate
change
.
However
,
the
language
of
the
event’s
theme
energy
evolution
clearly
takes
a
different
tack
businesses
need
to
adapt
quickly
in
order
to
capitalize
on
new
opportunities
,
implement
effective
strategies
,
and
avoid
being
disrupted
by
others
.
Some
means
of
new
capital
could
include
more
energy
efficient
innovations’
a
phrase
which
the
organizers
use
often
,
but
the
overall
messaging
is
clear
climate
change
might
be
a
disaster
,
but
it
also
opens
up
the
possibility
for
new
opportunities
to
invest
and
profit
.
This
framing
posits
the
climate
crisis
as
a
commodity
,
a
belief
that
reinforces
and
maintains
the
current
operation
of
the
fossil
fuel
and
non
renewable
energy
industry
as
the
status
quo
.
This
is
emphasized
by
Duke
Energy
Week’s
corporation
studded
sponsorship
list
featuring
Chevron
,
DTE
Energy
,
NRG
,
ExxonMobil
,
and
Duke
Energy
,
all
of
which
face
accusations
and
lawsuits
for
severe
environmental
degradation
,
some
on
a
global
scale
.
This
commodification
isn’t
limited
to
this
event
,
but
rather
is
intrinsic
to
the
history
of
Duke
long
before
climate
change
came
into
the
public
discourse
.
Despite
being
a
separate
entity
from
the
University
,
Duke
Energy
was
founded
by
James
B
.
Duke
after
his
cigarette
companies
went
under
.
Ever
since
,
the
company
has
produced
millions
of
tons
of
coal
ash
that
have
leached
into
North
Carolina’s
water
supply
and
poisoned
communities
.
The
company
has
explicitly
attempted
to
deny
responsibility
for
clean
up
.
At
the
same
time
,
members
of
the
Board
of
Trustees
throughout
Duke’s
history
have
invested
in
environmentally
damaging
practices
,
from
Aubrey
McClendon
whose
fortune
was
built
on
fracking
to
David
Rubenstein’s
investments
in
oil
and
coal
through
the
notorious
Carlyle
Group
.
As
the
climate
crisis
initiated
by
these
kinds
of
profit
seeking
ventures
grows
,
so
to
do
the
wallets
of
those
that
extract
dollars
from
desperation
.
In
our
September
editorial
we
highlighted
the
scramble
over
dwindling
freshwater
sources
,
but
examples
of
such
cynical
investments
,
from
flood
wall
construction
to
air
conditioning
,
abound
.
For
as
long
as
the
primary
historical
relationship
between
profit
and
environment
as
commodity
is
maintained
and
not
decoupled
,
it
seems
likely
that
such
profiteering
will
continue
.
Dr
.
Lawrence
Baxter
,
chairman
of
Duke’s
Advisory
Committee
on
Investment
Responsibility
ACIR
succinctly
addresses
this
contradiction
some
investments
are
quite
profitable
for
Duke
,
even
though
they
are
borderline
uncomfortable
for
us
.
This
,
alongside
the
fact
that
ACIR
has
continuously
rejected
student
demands
for
fossil
fuel
divestment
,
brings
us
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
this
relationship
itself
that
must
be
critiqued
and
addressed
.
This
relationship
isn’t
merely
an
abstraction
.
Its
language
,
even
when
expressed
in
marketable
buzzwords
of
conservation
,
obscures
the
actual
impacts
it
has
on
the
livelihoods
of
people
.
While
students
convene
for
Duke
Energy
Week
,
the
California
fires
rage
on
.
While
words
like
sustainability’
and
innovation’
are
thrown
around
by
keynote
speakers
from
companies
like
Chevron
,
our
livelihoods
burn
as
a
result
of
the
decisions
of
those
same
companies
.
This
is
not
an
exaggeration
,
but
merely
a
reminder
that
this
relationship
is
real
and
it
is
lethal
.
If
discourse
on
climate
change
and
sustainable
energy
opportunities
remains
limited
purely
to
a
paradigm
of
profit
,
then
the
discourse
is
missing
the
point
,
whether
ignorantly
or
maliciously
.
The
company
and
environment
may
momentarily
come
in
line
together
,
but
only
insofar
as
it
is
a
profitable
venture
.
Profit
does
not
care
about
livelihoods
nor
the
climate
it
only
cares
about
its
opportunities
to
expand
itself
.
The
only
sustainable
way
out
of
this
is
to
treat
this
relationship
critically
tomorrow’s
future
not
as
a
commodity
,
but
a
world
that
needs
to
be
secured
.
When
I
was
younger
,
my
mama
told
me
I
could
be
anything
I
wanted
.
I
knew
better
than
to
rise
above
my
station
.
Me
and
my
hundreds
of
siblings
were
born
on
a
sod
grass
farm
.
My
mother
died
shortly
after
we
were
born
,
but
I
still
remember
her
last
words
to
us
.
Aspire
to
greatness
,
she
said
.
We
could
one
day
be
planted
somewhere
like
the
White
House
South
Lawn
.
I
didn’t
want
greatness
.
My
dream
was
to
be
planted
in
a
quiet
backyard
in
Raleigh
.
I
wanted
a
comfortable
and
safe
life
.
Unfortunately
,
fate
had
different
plans
for
me
.
Soon
,
I
was
uprooted
and
brought
to
Duke
University
.
I
held
onto
some
hope
that
I
would
be
planted
somewhere
quiet
,
like
in
a
patch
behind
Keohane
.
Instead
,
I
was
unloaded
onto
dirt
in
Krzyzewskiville
.
I
shuddered
.
Some
of
my
siblings
looked
around
in
awe
,
amazed
that
they
would
be
chosen
for
such
a
prestigious
position
.
I
knew
better
.
I
knew
what
really
went
on
in
K
Ville
.
We
were
beautiful
at
first
.
Visitors
and
tour
groups
marveled
at
our
color
,
and
made
sure
to
get
us
in
the
frame
of
their
pictures
of
the
K
Ville
sign
.
Duke
spent
a
lot
of
time
caring
for
us
.
The
University
watered
us
every
night
and
carefully
clipped
us
.
My
siblings
were
convinced
that
Duke
truly
cared
about
us
.
But
then
came
basketball
season
.
The
first
home
game
was
brutal
.
Doe
eyed
first
years
had
no
idea
what
time
to
show
up
to
the
game
,
and
they
arrived
hours
earlier
than
necessary
.
The
idiots
abused
us
.
They
paced
around
on
us
,
they
sat
down
on
us
,
they
picked
us
.
That
was
only
the
beginning
.
The
first
years
never
learned
their
lessons
.
They
kept
coming
early
to
basketball
games
and
kept
abusing
us
.
My
siblings
tried
to
keep
their
spirits
high
.
Duke
still
cared
about
us
,
right
?
They
still
watered
us
.
They
still
clipped
us
.
No
,
I
whispered
to
them
,
wait
until
January
.
January
came
and
so
did
tenting
season
.
I
had
heard
about
tenting
from
a
grass
back
on
the
sod
farm
.
The
grass
said
she
would
sooner
be
planted
on
a
grazing
pasture
than
in
K
Ville
during
tenting
season
.
I
looked
around
me
.
Dozens
of
students
stood
around
our
perimeter
,
holding
tarps
in
their
hands
.
I
wondered
why
they
didn’t
step
on
us
.
Usually
students
loved
to
walk
around
on
us
.
But
now
,
they
were
being
very
careful
not
to
touch
us
at
all
.
Something
was
wrong
.

Suddenly
,
a
human
yelled
something
through
a
bullhorn
.
Then
dozens
upon
dozens
of
students
ran
onto
the
grass
.
It
was
a
bloodbath
.
My
siblings
were
crushed
by
students
running
to
grab
a
spot
on
the
lawn
.
Some
were
further
smothered
by
a
plastic
tarp
.
The
humans
had
no
mercy
.
They
put
crates
down
on
the
tarps
to
further
suffocate
my
siblings
.
Soon
,
the
humans
put
up
tents
.
They
drove
stakes
into
my
siblings’
backs
.
They
pounded
the
stakes
further
and
further
,
ignoring
my
brethrens'
screams
.
By
some
miracle
of
the
Grass
God
,
I
survived
.
I
sat
between
four
tents
.
Even
though
I
survived
,
life
was
not
worth
living
.
Humans
poured
beer
and
vomit
on
me
every
other
night
.
They
dragged
lawn
chairs
and
lawn
ornaments
on
me
.
They
tortured
me
with
their
nightly
renditions
of
Take
Me
Home
,
Country
Roads
by
John
Denver
.
My
few
surviving
siblings
thought
that
they
had
endured
the
worst
.
The
worst
was
yet
to
come
with
P
Checks
.
I
have
never
known
such
agony
.
Please
,
remember
my
story
,
and
perhaps
one
day
,
K
Ville
Grass
will
be
afforded
dignity
.
Last
week
,
former
President
Barack
Obama
condemned
the
leftward
shift
of
the
Democratic
party
at
an
event
in
D
.
C
.
Pointing
the
finger
primarily
at
young
activists
,
he
argued
that
such
a
shift
would
alienate
crucial
moderate
voters
prior
to
the
2020
election
.
Considering
the
insistent
emphasis
on
electability
this
election
cycle
,
Obama’s
call
for
a
more
palatable
and
centrist
Democratic
party
appears
reasonable
.
But
in
doing
so
,
Obama
is
reproducing
an
ideology
that
actively
excludes
dissenting
voices
,
especially
those
of
young
people
,
in
the
name
of
civility
.
For
years
,
pundits
have
invoked
respectability
politics
as
an
all
purpose
deterrent
against
new
ideas
as
well
as
to
silence
dissent
.
This
legacy
threads
its
way
through
American
history
,
from
the
logic
used
to
justify
slavery
,
to
the
backlash
against
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
,
to
the
shocked
responses
to
ACT
UP
and
other
AIDS
activism
.
Such
emphasis
on
civility
or
respectability
to
the
detriment
of
both
dialogue
and
progress
is
also
clearly
alive
and
well
today
in
national
politics
as
well
as
here
on
campus
.
One
recent
column
argued
for
activists
especially
women
to
remember
mannered
ness
,
even
if
doing
so
makes
them
appear
lackluster
or
conformist
or
meek
.
Whether
intentional
or
not
,
this
again
enforces
the
implicit
association
between
civil
behavior
and
adherence
to
the
status
quo
an
option
for
some
perhaps
,
but
often
not
for
those
who
are
actively
harmed
by
white
supremacist
or
patriarchal
structures
to
name
just
a
few
.
Outside
the
pages
of
the
Opinion
Section
,
evidence
of
condescending
respectability
politics
abounds
.
During
President
Price’s
address
to
alumni
last
year
,
Dean
Sue
Wasiolek
handed
fliers
to
student
protesters
,
reminding
them
that
they
would
only
have
their
message
s
heard
as
long
as
they
did
so
without
disruptive
demonstration
.
Actions
such
as
these
belittle
those
with
valid
concerns
and
weaken
their
voices
by
intentionally
directing
them
towards
outlets
in
which
they
are
unlikely
to
receive
any
substantial
attention
.
This
obsession
with
process
and
manners
is
also
central
to
the
boomer
mindset
,
which
,
beyond
being
fabulously
memeable
,
centrally
consists
of
a
dismissal
of
ideas
and
people
outside
the
norm
.
We
see
this
most
obviously
in
the
treatment
of
young
people
as
lacking
wisdom
.
While
older
people
inherently
have
more
experiences
,
we
should
reject
the
notion
that
age
is
the
only
acceptable
measure
of
wisdom
.
On
the
issue
of
gun
violence
,
for
instance
,
Millennials
and
members
of
Generation
Z
have
live
in
an
era
of
seemingly
endless
school
shootings
that
older
members
of
society
simply
did
not
experience
.
In
terms
of
climate
change
,
young
people
have
the
most
at
stake
,
yet
are
placed
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
blasé
politicians
that
frequently
take
actions
detrimental
to
their
future
livelihoods
.
When
a
Duke
first
year
asked
Joe
Biden
about
the
donations
he
receives
from
the
fossil
fuel
industry
at
an
event
last
month
,
he
dismissed
her
question
calling
her
child
.
this
is
in
keeping
with
his
track
record
of
belittling
anyone
,
especially
young
women
,
that
dares
to
challenge
his
ideas
.
nbsp
;
Similarly
,
last
month
,
President
Trump
sarcastically
praised
climate
change
activist
Greta
Thunberg
on
Twitter
as
a
happy
young
girl
.
In
this
context
,
where
young
people
with
direct
experience
of
some
of
the
most
pressing
national
issues
of
our
time
are
ignored
and
attacked
by
older
generations
,
one
can
understand
the
emergence
of
Generation
Z’s
new
favorite
blanket
response
Ok
,
Boomer
.
Rather
than
just
a
reductive
swipe
at
any
and
everyone
born
in
the
post
war
era
,
the
phrase
contests
the
values
and
ideologies
of
that
time
that
today
feel
antiquated
and
oppressive
.
Importantly
,
the
ideals
inherent
in
the
boomer
mindset
are
not
exclusively
related
to
age
.
Even
at
Duke
,
in
a
world
of
teenagers
and
twenty
somethings
,
we
preserve
and
reproduce
them
.
Many
of
us
have
internalized
traditional
ideas
of
success
born
out
of
a
post
war
imagining
of
the
American
Dream
.
We
value
our
self
worth
in
terms
of
money
and
prestige
and
subscribe
to
an
unhealthy
version
of
personal
responsibility
where
every
problem
is
solved
by
merely
tugging
on
our
bootstraps
.
And
of
course
,
there
is
again
the
persistent
call
for
civility
and
respectability
.
Those
of
us
that
accept
these
ideas
not
only
reinforce
an
antiquated
mentality
,
but
are
complicit
in
the
maintenance
of
a
status
quo
that
threatens
our
ability
to
address
the
climate
crisis
,
prevent
thousands
of
needless
deaths
or
invest
in
decent
housing
for
our
neighbors
.
Over
the
past
few
months
,
Ok
,
Boomer
,
has
shattered
the
traditional
paradigm
of
our
national
conversation
;
older
adults
are
no
longer
the
only
ones
setting
the
terms
and
rules
of
political
debate
.
To
young
people
,
the
phrase
is
an
empowering
inversion
of
something
that
we
have
been
told
all
of
our
lives
that
we
are
just
kids
,
that
our
opinions
are
invalid
because
of
our
inexperience
.
On
its
own
,
tying
age
to
wisdom
is
problematic
young
people
understand
this
.
However
,
by
appropriating
this
tactic
for
our
own
advantage
,
we’ve
finally
claimed
a
space
in
the
national
discourse
a
space
that
,
like
the
Boomers
that
came
before
us
,
we
surely
plan
to
hold
onto
.
Has
our
government
failed
us
?
It
claims
to
uphold
the
highest
ideals
of
democratic
representation
,
yet
cronyism
abounds
.
It
purports
to
promote
the
welfare
of
its
citizens
,
but
its
legislative
agenda
consists
of
self
congratulatory
vanity
projects
.
If
nothing
else
,
this
house
has
resolved
to
its
own
wondrous
virtue
.
Our
elected
representatives’
failure
to
live
up
to
their
stated
ambitions
comes
at
a
great
cost
their
own
legitimacy
.
Constituents
wonder
what
their
representatives
even
do
and
whether
legislators
simply
seek
some
fluff
to
add
to
their
resumes
.
Duke’s
foremost
deliberative
body
,
Duke
Student
Government
DSG
,
faces
a
crisis
of
confidence
.
Beyond
anecdotes
,
DSG’s
failure
to
galvanize
students
is
revealed
statistically
.
Despite
extensive
election
coverage
in
the
Chronicle
,
candidate
flyers
papering
every
possible
public
surface
and
the
easy
,
breezy
beauty
of
electronic
voting
,
only
around
33
of
Duke
undergraduates
voted
in
the
last
three
Presidential
elections
.
For
God’s
sakes
,
more
Duke
students
turned
out
to
vote
for
the
oh
so
inspirational
congressman
G
.
K
Butterfield
in
2018
,
pushing
his
vote
count
from
nearly
70
to
just
under
70
.
Duke
students
are
apparently
more
interested
in
the
uncompetitive
,
off
year
congressional
election
of
a
septuagenarian
than
in
the
governance
of
their
own
community
.
nbsp
;
So
what’s
wrong
?
It's
not
the
fundamentals
,
which
are
ideal
.
DSG
governs
a
student
body
that
is
bright
and
informed
.
Its
representatives
are
passionate
,
focused
and
forthcoming
yearly
,
a
large
crop
of
enthusiastic
first
years
arises
to
replace
the
departed
seniors
.
With
an
annual
budget
of
almost
400
,
000
,
DSG’s
coffers
runneth
over
.
The
problem
is
inherent
to
DSG’s
electoral
system
.
The
DSG
Senate
consists
of
60
members
,
48
elected
representatives
,
12
per
class
year
,
and
12
selected
At
Large
Senators
.
The
issue
with
electing
Senators
by
class
year
is
that
doing
so
assumes
the
existence
of
a
collective
interest
amongst
students
on
that
basis
.
For
instance
,
what
do
all
sophomores
universally
share
?
They
are
of
a
similar
age
group
,
they
enrolled
at
the
same
time
and
they
all
have
a
few
common
undergraduate
experiences
.
Besides
these
marginally
significant
facts
,
not
much
unites
sophomores
,
or
any
given
class
of
students
,
at
Duke
.
No
wonder
Duke
students
are
abstaining
from
Senate
elections
,
DSG’s
electoral
system
demands
they
express
a
collective
interest
that
does
not
exist
.
If
not
class
year
,
then
what
does
unite
Duke
students
?
Anyone
familiar
with
our
campus
knows
that
Duke
students
are
meaningfully
bound
together
by
their
academic
pursuits
,
their
moral
convictions
,
their
particular
,
personal
interests
and
their
career
aspirations
.
Conveniently
,
all
of
these
categories
,
these
ties
that
bind
us
,
are
physically
manifested
within
our
on
campus
housing
system
.
The
members
of
Illyria
share
far
more
and
have
a
far
clearer
collective
interest
than
any
randomly
selected
group
of
juniors
.
The
residents
of
Giles
are
far
better
acquainted
with
each
other
than
they
are
with
the
residents
of
Blackwell
dorm
,
despite
the
fact
that
both
dorms
are
populated
by
first
years
.
Therefore
,
rather
than
arbitrarily
asking
Duke
students
to
vote
for
12
Senators
to
represent
their
class
year
,
DSG’s
electoral
system
should
be
based
on
living
groups
and
every
living
group
should
be
represented
by
a
single
Senator
in
DSG
Senate
.
As
of
now
,
DSG
Senate
elections
are
distant
,
impersonal
affairs
.
Generally
speaking
,
most
students
do
not
know
the
candidates
that
are
running
to
represent
them
and
,
therefore
,
do
not
much
care
who
is
elected
.
But
what
if
the
candidate
running
to
represent
you
in
DSG
Senate
lived
just
down
the
hall
?
What
if
your
next
Senator
was
going
to
be
a
sister
in
your
sorority
or
a
member
of
your
SLG
?
In
that
case
,
surely
,
students
would
pay
closer
attention
and
be
more
likely
to
vote
in
DSG
elections
.
Moreover
,
this
change
would
improve
the
quality
of
DSG’s
political
representation
,
as
electoral
outcomes
would
be
more
finely
attuned
to
voter
preferences
.
In
a
win
for
political
accountability
,
elections
would
also
cease
to
be
the
sole
opportunity
for
voters
to
influence
their
representatives
.
Under
this
system
,
by
virtue
of
proximity
,
constituents
could
easily
access
their
Senators
and
lobby
them
on
group
priorities
when
necessary
.
If
DSG
Senators
want
to
be
reelected
,
they
will
take
constituent
feedback
and
,
by
extension
,
their
seat
in
DSG
seriously
.
This
would
diminish
the
perception
that
Senators
run
for
DSG
Senate
just
to
have
another
social
engagement
or
leadership
activity
to
throw
on
the
resume
.
In
turn
,
confidence
in
the
legitimacy
and
usefulness
of
DSG
would
increase
because
students
would
have
a
direct
,
personal
connection
to
their
representation
.
Finally
,
DSG
would
also
be
greatly
improved
if
At
Large
Senators
were
abolished
.
Rather
than
being
elected
,
At
Large
Senators
are
selected
by
an
interview
process
conducted
by
the
Selection
Committee
,
which
is
composed
of
members
of
DSG’s
Executive
Branch
.
Essentially
,
this
is
a
group
of
Senators
who
reflect
the
interests
of
DSG’s
executives
rather
than
the
will
of
the
voters
.
Holding
20
of
the
seats
in
DSG
Senate
,
At
Large
Senators
obfuscate
DSG’s
democratic
purpose
.
They
represent
no
one
in
the
student
body
and
such
Senators
are
only
at
large
in
one
sense
they
have
indefensibly
evaded
democracy
.
Seemingly
the
product
of
affirmative
action
for
failed
populists
,
At
Large
Senators
should
not
be
permitted
in
an
organization
that
claims
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
highest
ideals
of
democratic
representation
.
DSG
should
either
take
itself
seriously
as
a
legitimate
representative
body
or
throw
in
the
towel
and
admit
it
is
just
an
institutionalized
resume
filler
.
It
is
high
time
to
decide
.
At
present
,
DSG
is
a
tin
pot
democracy
.
Its
grand
delusions
of
popular
representation
butt
heads
with
the
reality
of
its
inadequacy
.
Yet
with
a
touch
of
tinkering
and
a
bit
of
change
,
Duke
Student
Government
could
become
more
democratic
and
more
authentically
representative
.
Let
us
reform
.
Challenge
yourself
.
Change
your
world
.
All
Duke
students
have
encountered
this
simple
mantra
,
whether
through
listings
of
summer
programs
or
flyers
push
pinned
to
the
wall
or
lecture
wide
announcements
.
They
summarize
the
quintessential
,
widely
publicized
,
transformative
Duke
student
experience
Duke
Engage
.
And
for
many
,
Duke
Engage
lives
up
to
expectations
.
Some
of
my
professors
and
upperclassmen
peers
have
spoken
highly
of
the
opportunities
presented
in
DukeEngage
Pathway
Projects
and
local
placements
.
However
,
I
was
exposed
to
a
different
perspective
when
the
ICS
Director
of
Undergraduate
studies
,
Catherine
Mathers
,
stood
before
my
class
and
asked
us
to
thoughtfully
consider
the
possible
harm
programs
like
DukeEngage
abroad
as
well
as
some
domestic
programs
might
do
.
For
context
,
our
class
had
previously
taken
part
in
a
discussion
about
the
detrimental
impacts
of
voluntourism
,
especially
in
countries
deemed
,
often
through
racialized
language
,
primitive
and
underdeveloped
and
violent
.
We’d
watched
work
for
the
locals
who
were
already
aware
of
the
resources
necessary
to
aid
their
own
communities
.
In
fact
,
the
entire
premise
of
her
service
was
built
upon
the
paternal
and
colonial
notion
that
white
Americans
knew
more
about
Tanzania
than
the
Tanzanians
themselves
.
In
many
ways
,
DukeEngage
contributes
to
the
same
notion
.
Its
Bahamas
program
speaks
of
aiding
displaced
youth
and
providing
solutions
aimed
at
minimizing
adverse
effects
of
Hurricane
Dorian
,
assuming
that
college
students
,
probably
none
native
to
the
Bahamas
,
have
all
of
the
solutions
.
DukeEngage
China
works
with
local
orphanages
,
which
are
notorious
for
purposefully
neglecting
and
abusing
children
to
funnel
money
into
the
hands
of
profiteers
and
traffickers
.
The
above
are
only
a
few
examples
of
the
damaging
yet
hegemonic
belief
of
doing
good
while
abroad
.
Those
not
specialized
in
a
specific
field
would
be
hard
pressed
to
find
we
must
begin
to
disentangle
volunteering
from
tourism
.
My
classmates
and
I
discussed
during
my
FOCUS
class
that
if
we
do
participate
in
DukeEngage
abroad
,
we
must
analyze
our
actions
every
day
to
ensure
that
we
are
working
as
equitably
as
possible
.
Ethics
are
not
black
and
white
;
we
can
and
should
ask
questions
about
DukeEngage
partner
organizations
and
the
history
of
Duke
alongside
the
communities
we
are
serving
.
And
,
if
at
all
possible
,
we
can
continue
a
long
term
relationship
with
our
Duke
Engage
partners
through
our
time
in
college
.

Professor
Mathers
wrote
in
an
email
,
Most
importantly
,
students
should
make
a
commitment
to
learning
as
much
as
possible
about
the
place
they
are
going
,
preferably
some
language
not
just
regional
but
of
the
local
people
if
possible
and
to
see
DukeEngage
as
part
of
a
broader
and
wide
ranging
education
about
a
region
or
a
global
challenge
.
DukeEngage
asserts
that
participation
will
change
your
world
,
and
perhaps
we
are
changing
our
own
worlds
through
new
narratives
and
perspectives
and
friendships
.
But
if
your
world
also
means
the
world
outside
oneself
,
how
are
we
fulfilling
this
mission
?
And
how
is
it
fair
to
assume
that
this
world
is
even
ours
to
change
?
At
this
year’s
Harvard
Yale
football
game
on
November
23
,
more
than
100
students
and
alumni
stormed
the
field
at
halftime
to
urge
their
universities
to
divest
from
fossil
fuel
companies
.
I
am
writing
to
make
the
same
demand
of
my
own
alma
mater
.
Just
as
Exxon
Mobile
and
the
Chevron
Corporation
are
in
the
business
of
selling
oil
and
natural
gas
,
Duke
University
is
in
the
business
of
educating
students
so
they
can
achieve
their
future
goals
.
Tragically
,
the
otherwise
bright
prospects
of
my
fellow
Blue
Devils
will
be
partly
dimmed
by
the
dramatic
consequences
of
burning
fossil
fuels
.
How
can
Duke
reconcile
its
mission
of
preparing
students
for
the
future
with
investment
strategies
that
indicate
tacit
approval
for
an
industry
whose
practices
directly
threaten
that
future
?
What
kind
of
message
does
it
send
when
Duke
talks
about
going
carbon
neutral
by
2024
while
continuing
to
provide
fossil
fuel
companies
with
the
funds
they
need
to
expand
production
of
planet
warming
substances
?
At
the
University’s
Advisory
Committee
on
Investment
Responsibility
ACIR
open
forum
in
October
,
Committee
Chair
Lawrence
Baxter
commented
that
divesting
from
fossil
fuels
would
be
merely
a
symbolic
statement
,
but
symbolic
statements
.
It
matters
when
a
University
with
a
reputation
like
Duke’s
signals
that
fossil
fuels
are
a
morally
acceptable
investment
.
It
matters
that
Harvard
and
Yale
students
and
alumni
disrupted
their
biggest
sports
event
of
the
year
to
express
outrage
over
their
institutions’
fossil
fuels
investments
.
And
though
I
am
just
one
person
,
it
matters
that
I
am
pledging
to
no
longer
donate
to
my
beloved
alma
mater
until
it
divests
from
fossil
fuels
.
I
hope
that
others
will
join
me
;
perhaps
then
our
collective
action
will
be
more
than
just
symbolic
.
The
term
gaslighting
the
denial
of
someone’s
reality
in
an
attempt
to
invalidate
or
dismiss
them
comes
from
the
1938
play
and
subsequent
movie
Gaslight
,
in
which
a
husband
manipulates
his
wife
to
the
point
that
she
questions
her
own
sanity
.
Sarah
Ottey
,
founder
of
PCOS
Challenge
The
National
Polycystic
Ovary
Syndrome
Association
,
coined
the
term
healthcare
gaslighting
to
highlight
the
sexism
and
weight
bias
women
often
experience
in
navigating
the
healthcare
system
.
Duke
students
are
also
familiar
with
the
phenomenon
.
In
my
last
column
,
I
discussed
sophomore
Cate
Schick’s
encounter
with
Student
Health
being
told
that
she
was
just
stressed
when
in
fact
,
she
was
experiencing
an
allergic
reaction
,
but
that
was
only
one
of
the
many
similar
cases
I
heard
.
Senior
Kezia
Matson
has
a
blood
regulation
condition
that
,
when
left
untreated
,
can
cause
chest
pain
,
racing
heart
rate
,
fatigue
and
lightheadedness
especially
when
standing
up
or
walking
symptoms
she
had
been
experiencing
for
over
a
year
.
Last
semester
,
she
visited
the
ER
three
times
due
to
extreme
symptoms
and
accompanying
fevers
.
Matson
tried
to
connect
with
a
cardiologist
in
the
Duke
hospital
,
but
she
was
told
that
as
a
Duke
student
,
she
needed
a
referral
from
Student
Health
.
At
Student
Health
,
a
nurse
practitioner
saw
in
her
records
that
she
was
previously
diagnosed
with
anxiety
,
and
decided
that
her
symptoms
were
a
manifestation
of
the
mental
illness
.
Matson
then
explained
that
in
the
preceding
summer
,
she
tried
to
recover
by
stepping
away
from
stress
and
working
on
a
farm
,
and
yet
her
symptoms
continued
to
worsen
.
And
that
light
physical
activity
exacerbates
her
symptoms
,
which
would
not
be
the
case
with
anxiety
.
But
the
NP
would
not
budge
.
She
was
very
dismissive
when
I
tried
to
give
my
thoughts
,
Matson
said
.
It
made
her
more
defensive
in
the
fact
that
she
believed
she
was
right
,
instead
of
taking
in
what
I
was
saying
.
Matson
read
online
that
a
tilt
table
test
changing
a
patient’s
position
quickly
and
seeing
how
their
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
respond
can
be
used
to
assess
her
symptoms
,
so
she
asked
the
NP
to
perform
the
test
on
her
.
She
was
very
unhappy
that
I
asked
her
to
do
it
,
Matson
recalled
.
The
test
results
indicated
that
her
heart
rate
and
blood
pressure
changing
dramatically
,
but
the
NP
insisted
that
the
numbers
didn’t
show
anything
.
Instead
of
referring
Matson
to
a
cardiologist
as
she
requested
,
she
referred
her
to
a
psychiatrist
,
which
she
already
had
.

Matson
later
learned
that
she
should’ve
been
given
a
positive
test
result
and
further
testing
.
In
the
weeks
following
the
appointment
,
she
worked
on
mitigating
her
supposed
anxiety
.
I
really
tried
to
tweak
it
from
the
standpoint
of
diet
and
wellness
and
when
I
didn't
see
results
,
it
made
me
feel
so
guilty
and
frustrated
,
Matson
said
.
I
was
being
mad
at
myself
for
trying
to
control
something
that
I
can't
control
.
Finally
,
she
met
with
an
off
campus
general
practitioner
,
who
immediately
referred
her
to
a
cardiologist
.
Student
Health’s
misdiagnosis
delayed
Matson
from
receiving
necessary
treatment
and
medication
,
negatively
impacting
her
academic
,
social
and
emotional
well
being
.
The
gaslighting
,
which
led
to
her
questioning
and
blaming
herself
for
her
physical
suffering
,
may
potentially
have
longer
lasting
effect
.
A
2015
study
interviewed
women
who
had
been
hospitalized
but
avoided
following
up
or
obtaining
routine
care
.
Many
cited
anxiety
about
being
perceived
as
complaining
about
minor
concerns
and
feeling
rebuffed
or
treated
with
disrespect
.
Another
senior
who
asked
that
I
only
disclose
his
year
recognizes
how
damaging
healthcare
gaslighting
can
be
,
after
he
tumbled
down
the
stairs
and
hit
his
head
on
the
hand
railing
of
a
lecture
hall
.
He
had
had
six
concussions
,
so
based
on
his
experience
,
he
was
sure
that
this
fall
led
to
a
seventh
.
The
doctor
at
Student
Health
,
however
,
noted
that
he
had
a
history
of
anxiety
and
was
only
being
anxious
about
having
a
concussion
.
He
then
asked
the
doctor
to
perform
a
concussion
test
,
which
he
refused
.
This
guy
was
so
cocky
about
it
,
he
said
.
He
was
like
,
you
need
to
be
knocked
around
to
get
a
concussion
.
I’ve
slipped
in
the
shower
and
got
a
concussion
.
Without
a
concussion
diagnosis
,
he
continued
to
do
activities
that
would
worsen
a
brain
injury
reading
,
looking
at
screens
frequently
and
engaging
in
physical
activity
.
As
much
as
he
pushed
himself
to
work
harder
,
his
symptoms
memory
loss
,
headache
,
fatigue
,
light
sensitivity
caused
him
to
frequently
miss
class
and
deadlines
.
He
recalled
feeling
conflicted
between
what
the
doctor
said
and
how
his
body
felt
.
I
was
like
,
I
definitely
have
a
concussion
.
I'm
concussed
.
But
then
I
was
like
,
oh
maybe
I'm
just
anxious
and
they're
right
and
I'm
overthinking
it
,
he
said
.
I
was
alternating
between
I
feel
horrible’
and
blaming
myself
for
feeling
horrible
.
A
week
and
a
half
later
,
his
symptoms
became
so
severe
that
he
called
his
mom
and
asked
her
to
take
him
to
a
neurologist
,
who
quickly
diagnosed
him
with
a
concussion
.
The
injury
led
him
to
STINF
all
of
his
midterms
and
miss
another
week
and
a
half
of
school
almost
three
weeks
of
class
missed
in
total
.
nbsp
;
I
was
struggling
to
catch
up
for
the
rest
of
the
semester
,
and
I
don’t
think
it
would’ve
been
that
bad
if
I
had
been
told
right
away
that
I
was
concussed
,
he
said
.
nbsp
;
Student
Health’s
misdiagnosis
and
gaslighting
not
only
impacted
his
academics
and
potentially
caused
permanent
neurological
damage
,
but
also
,
ironically
,
caused
him
considerable
anxiety
.
The
doctor’s
words
unleashed
an
odd
mind
game
He
would
think
that
he
had
a
concussion
,
then
become
upset
with
himself
for
worsening
his
symptoms
by
doing
what
the
doctor
told
him
not
to
being
anxious
about
having
a
concussion
.
Student
Health’s
deficiencies
can
have
dangerous
impact
.
A
psychological
misdiagnosis
can
make
a
rare
disease
patient’s
actual
diagnostic
delayed
2
.
5
to
14
times
0
.
5
to
12
times
more
than
a
non
psychological
misdiagnosis
according
to
a
survey
of
12
,
000
European
patients
.
That
is
time
in
which
the
disease
can
spread
or
further
compromise
the
body
.
A
student’s
record
of
mental
illness
does
not
provide
an
excuse
to
bypass
one’s
medical
duties
.
Anxiety
is
not
a
Band
Aid
that
can
be
stuck
onto
any
set
of
symptoms
without
further
testing
.
By
invalidating
a
patient’s
suffering
and
undermining
the
voice
in
their
own
head
,
one
is
doing
what
Charles
Boyer
did
to
Ingrid
Bergman
dimming
and
brightening
the
gaslights
,
but
telling
her
she’s
just
imagining
things
.
In
case
your
parents
aren’t
as
prompt
in
informing
you
of
the
happenings
of
the
Duke
Parents
Facebook
page
as
my
mom
is
,
this
weekend
is
Family
Weekend
.
It
promises
to
be
a
full
two
to
three
days
of
awkward
introductions
,
waiting
in
lines
,
and
neglecting
your
homework
.
Exciting
,
no
?
One
of
the
most
challenging
parts
of
having
family
visit
is
trying
to
decide
where
to
eat
.
Durham
has
dozens
of
wonderful
restaurants
,
and
no
matter
what
vibe
you’re
looking
for
,
I’m
sure
there
is
a
place
that’s
perfect
for
your
family
.
If
you’re
having
a
hard
time
deciding
,
here
are
a
few
of
my
suggestions
,
free
of
charge
.
You’re
welcome
.
The
menu
alone
provides
several
dozen
conversation
topics
that
steer
clear
of
any
questions
you’d
rather
avoid
entirely
.
When
they
ask
about
grades
,
or
the
drinking
scene
on
campus
,
or
if
you
watched
the
Democratic
debates
last
week
,
just
invite
the
waiter
over
to
explain
the
whole
imported
beef
thing
again
.
It’ll
blow
their
minds
.
And
let
me
tell
you
,
Elmo’s
holds
up
.
There’s
something
on
the
menu
for
everyone
even
your
vegan
but
still
eats
eggs
sister
.
Breakfast
for
dinner
?
To
quote
Old
El
Paso
,
Anything
you
want
to
eat
,
Elmo’s
has
it’s
basically
the
Room
of
Requirement
of
Durham
eateries
.
Your
sister
will
put
their
star
shaped
paper
lanterns
on
her
Instagram
story
;
your
parents
can
give
Gonza
five
stars
on
the
basis
of
their
black
beans
alone
;
everyone
can
take
a
bizarre
family
photo
under
their
neon
outdoor
sign
.
Fun
!
If
restaurants
can
be
placed
on
the
D
amp
;
D
alignment
chart
,
Pompieri
is
definitely
chaotic
good
,
in
the
best
way
.
Everyone
will
have
a
great
time
,
once
your
parents
get
over
the
novelty
of
the
scissors
situation
and
actually
try
the
pizza
.
The
Parlour
offers
some
of
the
best
ice
cream
around
,
but
who
among
us
can
regularly
afford
such
a
luxury
?
During
Family
Weekend
,
that
all
goes
out
the
window
.
They
even
have
dairy
free
options
for
your
vegan
but
still
eats
eggs
sister
,
so
truly
the
whole
fam
can
join
the
fun
.
It’s
time
to
go
all
out
.

Wallow
all

In
September
of
2017
,
President
Price
convened
the
Commission
on
Memory
and
History
to
advise
him
on
addressing
issues
of
memorialization
on
campus
.
Members
of
the
commission
would
nbsp
;
review
future
concerns
and
recommend
a
suitable
use
of
the
vacant
space
at
the
Chapel
.
The
commission
consisted
of
16
members
,
including
professors
,
faculty
from
various
departments
,
and
an
undergraduate
representative
,
but
no
nonacademic
worker
.
It’s
a
notable
omission
given
that
one
of
Price’s
goals
is
to
give
recognition
to
those
individuals
whose
labor
was
the
foundation
of
the
wealth
that
created
Duke
University
and
whose
hands
built
our
campus
.
How
can
the
Commission’s
membership
fail
to
include
representatives
of
the
very
people
they
are
trying
to
recognize
?
Commission
member
Dr
.
William
Ferris
,
a
history
professor
at
the
University
of
North
Carolina
Chapel
Hill
,
said
he
was
not
sure
why
nonacademic
staff
were
not
involved
.
I
was
asked
simply
to
participate
and
did
participate
as
fully
as
I
could
.
But
I
agree
with
you
,
that
was
an
oversight
and
it
should
have
been
done
,
he
said
.
Former
Duke
housekeeper
Shawn
Easterling
,
for
one
,
is
disappointed
but
not
surprised
by
the
underrepresentation
on
the
administrative
level
.
As
he
put
it
,
nbsp
;
You
have
all
your
educated
people
discussing
the
non
educated
people
,
so
to
speak
,
without
the
non
educated
people
being
there
.
I
can’t
tell
you
about
your
culture
without
having
you
there
.
I
need
you
there
to
be
part
of
that
conversation
.
There’s
going
to
be
some
things
that
are
going
to
be
discussed
that
they’re
not
going
to
look
at
,
that
the
service
workers
will
see
,
recognize
,
and
know
.
For
example
,
Easterling
believes
that
instead
of
taking
down
statues
like
that
of
Robert
E
.
Lee
,
other
statues
should
be
added
alongside
them
.
Go
ahead
and
memorialize
other
cultures
that
have
had
things
happen
to
them
and
leave
those
statues
and
other
memorials
,
he
says
.
The
reason
I
say
that
is
if
you
keep
taking
down
our
history
,
we
won’t
know
our
history
because
you
keep
trying
to
erase
it
To
me
,
I
would
rather
know
about
my
history
rather
than
hiding
it
.
Charles
Gooch
,
an
employee
of
Duke
for
46
years
,
echoes
the
need
for
a
more
inclusive
commission
.
They
need
some
everyday
people
on
there
,
he
says
.
When
you
look
down
on
a
nobody
,
you
say
that
we’re
supposed
to
do
stuff
like
this
,
you’re
gonna
get
overlooked
.
That’s
the
disappointing
thing
,
and
it’s
why
I’m
very
outspoken
.
I
tell
them
what
I
hear
,
I
see
,
and
I
feel
.
Gooch
thinks
there
should
be
some
type
of
memorial
for
the
people
who
put
all
these
years
of
service
and
don’t
get
recognition
.
For
as
long
as
he’s
been
here
,
Gooch
has
watched
fellow
workers
like
himself
pour
years
of
service
into
Duke
.
Where
have
you
seen
something
to
remember
the
workforce
?
It’s
only
the
academic
people
the
only
black
man
I
know
is
John
Hope
Franklin
Center
.
He
was
a
prominent
black
man
.
They
named
it
after
him
.
But
he
sic
only
been
here
a
few
years
.
We’ve
got
people
putting
in
25
,
30
years
We
want
respect
,
too
.
At
the
50th
reunion
of
the
1969
Allen
Building
Takeover
in
February
,
Howard
Fuller
,
a
prominent
civil
rights
activist
who
spearheaded
community
organizing
work
in
Durham
,
proposed
a
memorial
be
built
for
Oliver
Harvey
.
Easterling
,
when
asked
who
he
wants
to
see
memorialized
,
replied
,
My
first
statue
would
be
of
Oliver
Harvey
.
That’s
the
man
that
founded
the
Union
.
I
would
start
with
him
.
Gooch
also
supports
the
proposal
,
especially
because
most
Local
77
employees
don’t
know
who
he
is
,
and
expressed
his
disappointment
in
the
union’s
lack
of
effort
to
give
him
homage
.
To
choose
just
one
worker
to
memorialize
,
however
,
would
be
too
difficult
for
Gooch
.
I
wouldn’t
know
,
he
says
,
because
they
should
put
all
the
workers
.
Just
like
in
war
,
they
put
statues
of
people
.
.
.
Show
these
are
the
workers
at
Duke
that
put
their
heart
and
life
in
.
This
is
a
statue
of
housekeeping
and
food
service
workers
.
President
and
founder
of
Duke
Students
and
Workers
Alliance
,
graduating
senior
Grace
Mok
,
agrees
that
a
memorial
is
not
the
end
all
be
all
.
She
says
,
It
doesn’t
sound
bad
,
but
I
don’t
know
if
that’s
necessarily
the
best
way
to
memorialize
them
either
.
It’s
also
not
a
material
change
.
It’s
a
symbolic
one
to
honor
what
has
been
done
,
but
a
statue
doesn’t
raise
wages
or
change
schedules
back
I
have
mixed
feelings
,
but
I
also
feel
like
it’s
not
my
answer
that
matters
.
Easterling
thinks
that
taking
down
and
putting
up
statues
causes
too
much
commotion
.
Instead
,
we
need
dialogue
.
We
need
to
talk
about
it
more
,
he
says
.
Our
discussion
about
it
first
and
foremost
would
bring
up
some
interesting
points
.
But
to
just
go
ahead
and
start
putting
up
statues
of
African
American
history
and
taking
down
the
other
history
I
don’t
think
that’s
the
answer
.
I
think
that
would
cause
more
confusion
than
anything
and
add
fuel
to
the
race
war
that
we
already
have

If
he
were
on
the
commission
,
he
would
want
to
focus
more
on
education
and
conversation
,
because
statue
or
not

he
says
,
the
fact
that
the

is
acknowledgement

Two
weeks
ago
I
wrote
an
op
ed
entitled
It
is
time
for
the
Christian
church
to
respond
to
Christianist
violence
in
America
,
linking
white
supremacy
to
its
roots
in
Christian
theology
.
In
writing
this
piece
,
I
sought
to
start
a
discussion
on
the
relationship
between
Christianism
and
the
responsibility
of
Christians
as
delicately
and
respectfully
as
I
could
.
One
of
my
fellow
columnists
,
Reiss
Becker
,
disagreed
with
my
characterization
.
nbsp
;
Andrew
Sullivan
defines
the
term
in
his
Christianism
is
an
ideology
,
politics
,
an
ism
.
The
distinction
between
Christian
and
Christianist
echoes
the
distinction
we
make
between
Muslim
and
Islamist
It
is
the
belief
that
religion
dictates
politics
and
that
politics
should
dictate
the
laws
for
everyone
,
Christian
and
non
Christian
alike
.
While
Becker
asserts
that
Real
Christians
,
real
people
of
various
sects
,
colors
,
and
backgrounds
,
are
implicated
and
suffer
reputational
consequences
when
subjected
to
careless
generalizations
that
affiliate
their
faith
with
evil
,
he
neglects
to
note
that
I
did
not
generalize
carelessly
.
This
is
exactly
why
we
should
employ
the
term
Christianist
,
in
order
to
distinguish
this
violence
from
faithful
Christians
.
The
purpose
of
my
article
was
to
point
out
that
Christianist
violence
in
America
exists
,
but
that
it
is
not
adequately
named
as
such
.
My
statement
,
white
supremacy
,
which
is
ideologically
linked
to
Christianity
.
.
.
is
not
slander
.
I
am
not
saying
that
Christianity
is
white
supremacist
,
but
rather
nbsp
;
that
white
supremacy
has
roots
in
Christian
ideology
.
In
her
book
,
,
Jeannine
Hill
Fletcher
writes
,
the
theology
of
Christian
supremacy
gave
birth
to
the
ideology
of
White
supremacy
,
and
White
supremacy
grew
from
a
dangerous
ideology
to
an
accepted
position
inherited
by
Whites
.
This
relationship
between
Christian
theology
and
whiteness
is
highly
implicated
in
the
current
stance
among
white
evangelical
voters
that
they
need
to
reclaim
the
country
in
effect
,
to
Make
America
Great
Again
for
white
people
.
I
am
in
no
way
asserting
that
Christians
are
violent
,
or
that
their
religion
inherently
breeds
violence
.
It
would
be
equally
incorrect
to
assert
that
Islam
is
a
violent
religion
.
Islam
is
not
violent
.
There
are
violent
individuals
who
use
the
tenets
of
the
religion
to
pursue
their
violent
agenda
.
The
same
goes
for
Christianity
.
Think
the
Crusades
.
Think
the
KKK
.
Think
White
supremacy
today
.
In
his
article
,
,
Mark
Juergensmeyer
analyzes
current
trends
in
Christianist
violence
in
America
In
the
United
States
,
attacks
on
abortion
clinics
,
the
killing
of
abortion
clinic
staff
,
and
the
destructive
acts
of
members
of
Christian
militia
movements
are
chilling
examples
of
assaults
on
the
legitimacy
of
modern
social
and
political
institutions
,
based
on
the
theological
frameworks
of
reconstruction
theology
and
Christian
Identity
thinking
.
American
Christianism
is
a
white
supremacist
identity
politics
movement
,
not
a
religious
one
.
But
the
core
of
this
identity
is
linked
to
Christian
ideals
,
which
necessitates
a
strong
Christian
response
.
As
Becker
calls
me
to
better
clarity
in
my
writing
,
I
would
also
call
him
to
a
better
understanding
of
it
.
When
he
says
,
Arguing
there
is
an
ideological
link
between
Christianity
and
white
supremacy
ignores
the
existence
of
Black
,
Latino
,
and
Asian
Christians
is
their
faith
connected
to
white
supremacy
as
well
?
Obviously
,
if
the
believer
is
not
white
,
then
they
are
probably
not
implicated
in
supremacy
.
Black
,
Latino
,
and
Asian
Christians’
individual
faith
is
not
connected
to
white
supremacy
,
but
these
believers
are
nevertheless
impacted
by
white
supremacy
and
other
belief
systems
which
reinforce
a
racial
hierarchy
.
Christianity
was
used
as
a
tool
for
colonization
,
and
in
many
instances
it
was
colonialism
that
introduced
Christianity
to
these
groups
.
Non
white
Christians
aren't
implicated
in
white
supremacist
violence
,
and
so
far
have
not
been
implicated
in
Christianist
violence
because
Christianism
has
been
predominanlty
touted
by
white
believers
.
Directly
calling
out
Christianist
violence
,
among
other
cultural
perversions
present
in
our
nation
and
world
,
will
allow
us
to
respond
more
directly
to
these
issues
.
We
need
greater
understanding
of
the
underlying
factors
,
one
of
which
I
am
saying
is
some
Christians’
refusal
to
recognize
the
problem
children
among
them
.
The
idea
that
Christians
should
be
absolved
of
any
guilt
or
complicity
in
this
type
of
violence
,
while
Muslims
are
regularly
blamed
for
Islamist
extremism
,
is
blatant
hypocrisy
which
denotes
strong
bias
and
lack
of
awareness
in
this
current
climate
.
The
Public
Religion
Research
Institute
provides
compelling
research
on
by
religious
affiliation
,
showing
that
No
religious
group
expresses
a
larger
double
standard
than
white
evangelical
Protestants
.
White
evangelical
Protestants
are
the
most
likely
87
percent
to
disown
Christian
terrorists
who
claim
to
be
acting
in
Christianity’s
name
.
However
,
they
are
among
the
least
likely
44
percent
to
say
the
same
about
terrorists
who
identify
as
Muslim
.
Of
course
I
recognize
that
there
is
not
one
universal
Church
institution
which
can
respond
to
this
issue
,
but
that
is
not
what
I
am
asking
for
.
I
am
asking
that
many
parts
respond
.
Wherever
Christianists
are
implicated
,
believers
of
all
sects
have
the
opportunity
to
respond
.
I
would
not
agree
with
the
sentiment
in
Becker’s
article
that
religious
groups
should
only
be
held
morally
responsible
for
the
actions
of
their
own
believers
,
especially
as
it
pertains
to
Christianity
because
I
don't
believe
that
selective
moral
concern
is
a
tenet
of
the
faith
.
Christian
ideals
have
clearly
been
used
by
some
to
advance
a
Christianist
or
white
supremacis
agenda
,
and
I
want
to
understand
why
this
violence
is
happening
.
What
in
the
religion
has
allowed
it
?
What
in
the
culture
has
allowed
it
?
It
is
not
slander
to
call
for
introspection
into
Christian
ideals
as
well
as
how
they
are
being
misconstrued
and
abusively
implemented
by
fundamentalists
.

There
is
some
evidence
that
Christian
leaders
recognize
the
importance
of
confronting
white
supremacist
violence
.
In
2017
,
the
National
Catholic
Reporter
recounted
that
more
than
400
Christian
ethicists
and
other
theologians
have
signed
A
Statement
from
Christian
Ethicists
Without
Borders
on
White
Supremacy
and
Racism
.
The
statement
rejects
racist
,
anti
Semitic
,
anti
Muslim
,
and
neo
Nazi
ideology
as
a
sin
against
God
that
divides
the
human
family
created
in
God's
image
.
Thankfully
,
I
have
found
this
response
,
but
in
all
my
internet
searches
on
what
Christians
are
doing
to
address
Christianist
terrorism
,
the
results
come
few
and
far
in
between
.
There
should
be
many
more
reponses
,
and
that
includes
on
the
local
church
level
.
The
mission
for
Christians
in
America
today
may
well
be
to
reconnect
with
the
identity
politics
Christians
to
fight
white
supremacy
and
Christianism
at
its
roots
to
reclaim
the
hearts
of
Christianists
in
our
nation
.
On
November
5
,
the
city
of
Durham
will
have
its
municipal
elections
.
On
the
ballot
this
election
is
the
mayor’s
seat
,
three
at
large
council
members
and
the
Affordable
Housing
Bond
.
Over
the
years
,
Duke
students
have
been
told
to
care
about
and
vote
in
the
local
elections
,
from
Chronicle
opinion
columns
to
POLIS’s
comprehensive
all
in
voter
engagement
plan
.
Yet
voting
in
Durham
is
situated
within
a
larger
conversation
of
caring
,
as
students
in
the
University
.
As
Duke
undergraduates
,
what
does
it
mean
for
us
to
care
about
Durham
and
its
politics
?
The
2019
Durham
Voter
Guide
uses
the
tagline
This
is
your
city
,
your
home
.
Now
Durham’s
future
is
up
to
you
.
But
for
many
undergraduate
students
,
our
time
in
Durham
is
temporary
,
equivalent
to
an
average
of
four
years
at
Duke
living
in
Durham
is
seen
as
incidental
to
the
Duke
experience
.
There
is
a
shared
consciousness
of
the
Duke
bubble
,
but
popping
the
bubble
and
being
more
involved
in
Durham
must
come
with
some
amount
of
reflection
and
intention
as
well
.
For
Durham
to
become
our
city
,
our
home
,
it
demands
more
than
volunteer
hours
.
To
begin
,
the
campus
discussion
on
municipal
politics
need
not
center
on
Duke
undergraduates
.
nbsp
;
Though
we
primarily
interact
with
the
University
as
an
institution
of
higher
education
,
Duke’s
relationship
with
Durham
is
primarily
as
a
business
and
as
an
employer
.
To
say
,
as
some
have
,
that
students
should
involve
themselves
in
politics
because
they
are
so
much
more
well
educated
,
so
much
more
affluent
,
and
have
so
much
more
time
on
their
hands
not
only
assumes
a
monolithic
student
population
,
but
fails
to
fully
acknowledge
the
position
that
undergraduates
occupy
.
We
cannot
consider
ourselves
residents
of
Durham
by
default
and
neither
should
we
pretend
that
,
when
we
pop
the
bubble
,
we
are
not
representatives
of
this
University
and
its
complicated
history
.
These
considerations
are
particularly
relevant
this
election
cycle
as
Durham
is
asked
to
vote
on
an
Affordable
Housing
Bond
.
The
bond
is
supported
by
local
politicians
and
community
organizations
,
and
there
have
been
calls
to
get
students
involved
.
An
ambitious
plan
to
tackle
housing
affordability
in
Durham
,
the
bond
will
be
financed
by
property
taxes
a
cost
that
few
,
if
any
,
undergraduates
will
bear
.
Similarly
,
as
detailed
in
our
editorial
last
week
,
the
University
is
directly
responsible
for
much
of
the
downtown
growth
that
has
spurred
this
affordability
crisis
,
yet
no
calls
to
action
or
cajoling
of
the
student
electorate
has
engaged
with
or
even
acknowledged
this
history
.
To
ask
students
to
vote
in
the
hopes
that
they
might
benefit
from
a
solution
to
a
problem
Duke
created
without
requiring
any
of
the
cost
to
fall
on
the
University
is
misinformed
at
best
and
disingenuous
at
worst
.
Without
taking
a
definitive
stand
on
the
bond
or
any
of
the
other
items
on
the
ballot
this
Tuesday
,
we
would
urge
a
greater
reflexivity
and
degree
of
reflection
,
especially
in
the
undergraduate
community
.
A
guilt
ridden
vote
in
the
municipal
election
is
certainly
not
the
only
way
to
care
and
neither
is
it
necessarily
the
best
way
.
At
the
very
least
,
arguing
that
voting
is
equivalent
to
caring
excludes
those
who
are
not
able
to
vote
or
who
choose
to
vote
elsewhere
in
communities
in
which
they
feel
more
at
home
.
There
are
students
and
community
members
who
are
not
given
the
right
to
vote
or
have
been
institutionally
and
systematically
disenfranchised
,
including
international
students
,
undocumented
immigrants
,
Black
voters
and
Indigenous
peoples
.
There
are
other
ways
to
care
about
Durham
and
its
politics
,
especially
in
supporting
the
communities
in
Durham
that
were
organizing
before
we
came
and
will
continue
to
organize
long
after
we
leave
.
These
include
groups
such
as
Durham
for
All
,
Southerners
on
New
Ground
,
and
Durham
CAN
.
To
be
in
solidarity
with
them
,
we
can
show
up
with
our
physical
presence
when
they
call
us
to
;
we
can
listen
;
and
we
can
commit
to
a
process
of
learning
that
is
forever
ongoing
.
At
Duke
,
we
tend
to
exist
within
a
narrow
understanding
of
what
is
good
and
bad
,
with
such
limited
examples
of
what
is
good
.
But
voting
is
not
and
cannot
be
the
end
all
be
all
of
political
engagement
.
There
is
not
one
good
or
right
political
move
,
voting
or
otherwise
,
as
we
might
discover
if
we
spend
some
time
being
considerate
what
does
it
mean
to
volunteer
with
this
organization
?
Or
,
vote
for
this
candidate
?
Or
,
shop
at
this
specific
business
?
When
we
leave
campus
and
interact
with
Durham
,
we
are
representatives
of
the
University
,
whether
we
actively
choose
to
be
or
not
.
So
if
we
are
to
pop
the
bubble
,
let
us
do
so
with
care
.
When
I
found
myself
hastily
preparing
for
a
last
minute
trip
to
see
my
grandmother
earlier
this
semester
a
trip
that
would
involve
mostly
sitting
with
my
family
and
navigating
grief
I
packed
the
softest
and
most
comfortable
things
I
own
my
Duke
English
major
shirt
,
my
favorite
cotton
pants
and
the
least
sexy
underwear
of
all
time
.
My
brain
had
unconsciously
decided
to
prioritize
physical
comfort
in
anticipation
of
an
exceedingly
uncomfortable
few
days
.
When
I
looked
down
at
my
suitcase
,
I
wondered
why
would
I
give
myself
this
level
of
comfort
only
for
such
an
uncomfortable
time
?
Do
I
not
deserve
to
feel
good
in
my
body
even
on
the
days
when
I’m
not
hurting
?
This
question
is
important
to
me
because
I
live
with
chronic
pain
.
My
body
is
and
will
always
be
physically
painful
.
Why
would
I
ever
do
anything
to
make
this
body
hurt
more
?
The
immediate
answer
to
this
question
is
that
much
of
what
is
required
of
me
,
day
to
day
,
makes
my
body
more
uncomfortable
than
it
already
is
.
For
example
,
sitting
for
long
periods
of
time
,
especially
in
chairs
without
adequate
back
support
,
is
one
of
the
most
common
culprits
of
increased
pain
in
my
life
.
Yet
I
need
to
be
seated
for
the
duration
of
each
of
my
classes
,
usually
more
than
once
a
day
,
in
whatever
seats
are
available
in
whatever
classroom
I’m
assigned
.
The
same
truth
that
experiencing
increased
pain
is
built
into
my
daily
life
can
be
applied
to
big
heavy
doors
,
to
my
backpack
,
to
my
bras
.
I
interact
daily
with
things
that
turn
tolerable
pain
intolerable
.
But
it's
not
just
obligatory
activities
that
cause
me
more
pain
.
Often
my
back
hurts
more
after
sitting
,
not
because
I
picked
an
uncomfortable
chair
,
but
because
I
found
myself
leaning
forward
,
excited
by
a
conversation
or
enthralled
by
a
class
discussion
.
Singing
in
choir
,
dancing
my
heart
out
,
baking
cookies
,
making
out
in
the
car
,
taking
airplanes
to
exciting
places
all
of
these
joyful
things
cause
me
more
pain
.
If
I
were
to
orient
my
life
toward
reducing
pain
at
all
costs
,
would
I
not
have
to
give
up
these
joyful
,
painful
moments
?
And
what
about
bigger
,
more
life
changing
,
joyful
,
painful
things
,
like
being
a
pastor
or
social
worker
or
writer
or
all
three
?
What
about
being
a
parent
?
What
is
the
balance
,
in
a
life
of
chronic
pain
,
between
a
livable
life
and
a
joyful
one
?
Luckily
,
the
work
of
social
justice
facilitator
and
author
adrienne
maree
brown
name
intentionally
uncapitalized
came
into
my
life
recently
to
offer
me
some
answers
to
these
questions
.
brown’s
latest
book
,
satisfy
this
a
desire
within
me
,
that
will
hurt
more
than
they
heal
.
It
means
listening
to
my
body
,
giving
its
pain
the
room
to
take
up
however
much
space
it
requires
,
and
forgoing
the
shame
and
guilt
that
I
feel
when
my
body’s
limitations
are
different
from
the
limitations
of
the
other
bodies
around
me

Pleasure
activism
makes
room
for
two
things
to
be
true
at
the
same
time
for
this
body
of
mine
to
be
the
site
of
pain
,
but
also
the
site
of
joyful
and
liberatory
pleasure
.
Singing
,
dancing
,
baking
,
traveling
,
wandering
around
museums
,
sitting
in
classrooms
,
chatting
with
friends
,
lying
in
the
sunshine
,
stretching
on
a
yoga
mat
,
marching
at
protests
,
pastoring
,
parenting
,
living
all
of
it
will
hurt
.
But
these
pleasures
will
also
feel
good
in
the
place
in
my
soul
where
the
erotic
yes
,
the
most
whole
part
of
myself
,
resides
.
I
am
still
learning
how
to
do
this
,
to
answer
my
body’s
constant
pain
with
space
and
time
and
good
things
rather
than
shame
and
strictures
and
frustration
.
In
truth
,
I
haven’t
gotten
much
further
than
opening
big
heavy
doors
with
the
automated
button
and
wearing
more
Comfort
Colors
.
But
I
do
know
that
my
idea
of
the
future
something
that
often
simply
looked
like
pain
to
me
now
includes
pleasure
,
too
.

On
a
Friday
drive
from
East
to
West
Campus
,
I
tracked
how
many
e
scooters
I
saw
abandoned
in
the
middle
of
sidewalks
and
on
street
corners
.
Since
the
semester
began
,
I’ve
lost
count
of
how
many
parking
offenses
I’ve
seen
,
but
illegally
parked
in
a
single
cross
campus
trip
?
Aren’t
Duke
students
better
than
this
?
Ever
since
the
e
scooters
invaded
Durham
streets
and
sidewalks
back
in
June
,
students
have
jumped
all
over
this
convenient
and
cheap
transportation
.
An
e
scooter
can
turn
the
trek
from
Gross
Hall
to
Biddle
into
a
12
minute
trip
,
instead
of
a
race
to
the
bus
stop
only
to
find
the
C1
pulling
away
.
And
the
ride
costs
less
than
3
.
00
!
A
win
win
for
riders
and
vendors
,
right
?
Think
again
.
I
see
the
world
through
a
different
lens
though
not
by
choice
.
My
late
father
relied
on
mobility
devices
during
his
long
battle
against
a
rare
neurological
disease
.
So
instead
of
viewing
the
new
e
scooters
as
empowering
and
eco
friendly
alternatives
,
my
first
thought
was
,
Wow
,
this
is
an
ADA
nightmare
.
E
scooters
parked
in
the
middle
of
sidewalks
and
curb
cuts
violate
the
Americans
with
Disabilities
Act
ADA
.
At
best
,
they’re
a
nuisance
.
At
worst
,
they’re
a
danger
,
especially
for
people
who
live
with
vision
and
mobility
disabilities
.
Even
for
people
like
me
who
aren’t
differently
abled
,
carelessly
parked
e
scooters
are
annoying
and
hazardous
.
The
root
problems
are
student
ignorance
,
apathy
and
lack
of
accountability
.
Duke’s
Scooter
Operations
and
Parking
Guidelines
explicitly
say
,
Scooters
must
be
parked
upright
adjacent
to
nbsp
;
a
bicycle
rack
and
not
impede
pedestrians
,
and
then
decree
that
parked
e
scooters
shouldn’t
block
pedestrian
pathways
,
doors
or
access
ramps
,
and
fire
hydrants
.
But
,
as
students
have
already
demonstrated
,
it’s
pretty
easy
to
not
give
a
damn
.
There’s
no
convenient
way
in
real
time
to
track
down
an
illegally
parked
e
scooter’s
last
user
and
hold
them
accountable
,
which
means
there’s
no
incentive
to
park
responsibly
.
Laziness
and
convenience
win
the
day
and
e
scooters
get
left
everywhere
.
Without
an
enforcement
mechanism
that
holds
users
themselves
accountable
for
their
careless
parking
,
things
won’t
get
any
better
.
Students
might
frown
at
an
e
scooter
left
in
the
middle
of
the
nbsp
;
sidewalk
,
and
then
just
walk
around
,
figuring
it’s
someone
else’s
responsibility
.
But
when
Duke
senior
Bryan
Rusch
,
who
uses
a
wheelchair
,
found
a
diagonally
parked
e
scooter
blocking
the
sidewalk
one
day
,
he
didn’t
have
time
to
wait
for
PTS
to
impound
it
.
I
was
just
like
,
I
can’t
do
anything
!
’
Thank
goodness
I’m
slightly
able
bodied
,
because
I
had
to
get
down
and
grab
it
at
its
base
and
swing
it
,
then
move
myself
and
grab
it
and
swing
it
again
.
It
took
five
minutes
to
move
it
.
There
have
been
all
sorts
of
small
instances
like
that
.
It’s
been
a
pain
.
In
fact
,
even
members
of
the
Duke
Disability
Alliance
DDA
have
been
slow
to
grasp
the
scale
of
the
issue
.
No
one
had
raised
it
yet
.
Oh
,
dang
,
I
didn’t
realize
how
true
this
is
!
DDA’s
treasurer
,
senior
Trent
Lau
,
told
me
after
I
asked
the
group
to
weigh
in
.
It’s
a
hassle
even
for
people
who
don’t
live
with
a
disability
,
for
whom
an
e
scooter
parked
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
still
presents
a
safety
hazard
.
Last
night
I
was
running
,
it
was
dark
,
and
I
turned
the
corner
and
had
to
jump
out
of
the
way
because
there
was
a
scooter
right
in
the
middle
of
the
sidewalk
,
said
Kevin
Solomon
,
a
Duke
senior
and
a
member
of
DDA
.
It
affects
everyone
.
So
,
how
should
we
fix
it
?
Dr
.
Marion
Quirici
,
DDA’s
faculty
advisor
,
suggested
a
public
shaming
campaign
,
a
strategy
that
president
Symon
Ma
,
a
junior
,
agreed
could
work
.
I
think
advocacy
always
starts
with
awareness
,
or
like
,
you
know
,
publicity
,
Ma
said
.
Most
Duke
students
aren’t
heartless
.
In
fact
,
they
probably
think
they’re
doing
the
right
thing
by
using
an
eco
friendlier
mode
of
transportation
.
Some
people
really
just
don’t
care
.
says
Duke’s
ADA
Facilities
Program
Director
Tony
Galiani
.
But
they
also
might
not
even
realize
what
they’re
doing
.
Most
people
don’t
view
life
through
disability
goggles
.
Rusch
believes
people
need
to
open
their
eyes
to
how
people
with
disabilities
need
to
use
space
differently
.
You
could
walk
on
the
grass
,
I
can’t
.
You
can
do
this
,
I
can’t
.
You
could
move
that
scooter
two
steps
over
and
help
me
save
five
minutes
of
my
day
.
It
only
takes
two
seconds
of
yours
.
He
said
he’s
even
had
to
compete
with
e
scooter
users
for
space
on
ADA
mandated
ramps
.
Everyone
Duke
,
student
activists
,
the
e
scooter
companies
has
a
responsibility
to
raise
awareness
around
disability
.
Increased
awareness
needs
to
be
the
first
step
of
a
larger
action
plan
.
Durham
could
follow
Raleigh’s
lead
,
where
city
officials
ran
Bird
,
Spin
,
and
Lime
out
of
town
in
favor
of
Gotcha
,
whose
business
model
enforces
greater
accountability
.
In
contrast
to
the
others
,
Gotcha’s
e
scooter
wranglers
are
trained
employees
instead
of
part
time
contractors
.
If
you
don’t
park
your
e
scooter
in
one
of
their
designated
parking
zones
,
expect
a
fine
to
be
charged
right
to
your
phone
.
By
switching
exclusively
to
Gotcha
,
and
ending
business
with
other
companies
,
Duke
and
Durham
could
declare
a
commitment
to
responsibility
over
convenience
.
Change
could
start
right
now
.
But
if
students
can’t
be
held
accountable
for
careless
e
scooter
parking
,
Duke
should
simply
take
away
the
privilege
of
having
them
on
campus
.
So
,
students
step
it
up
,
give
a
damn
,
or
one
day
soon
,
you
might
wake
to
find
your
precious
e
scooters
gone
.
I’ve
been
having
this
thought
a
lot
recently
We
can’t
keep
acting
like
everything
is
going
to
be
ok
.
To
be
fair
,
I’m
not
quite
sure
who
the
we
is
here
,
and
I’m
sure
it’s
not
everyone
,
but
I
think
it’s
a
pretty
wide
smattering
.
I
first
began
seeing
Duke
culture
in
this
way
as
I
noticed
my
fellow
first
years
and
myself
find
our
way
at
Duke
through
following
various
subcultures
.
It
started
just
watching
the
droves
of
first
years
walking
around
East
Campus
quad
in
that
almost
feverish
Friday
night
way
,
dressed
as
if
to
make
clear
that
there
were
all
together
.
But
once
the
thought
first
struck
,
it
kept
coming
when
I
ran
into
acquaintances
coming
back
from
the
gym
in
smiles
,
as
I
sat
around
with
friends
talking
about
our
feelings
.
I
could
go
on
.
Three
clarifications
are
in
order
,
though
.
First
,
I’m
aware
that
lots
of
people
,
especially
here
at
Duke
,
would
never
.
And
from
our
actions
alone
,
it
seems
like
we
think
that
everything
is
going
to
be
ok
.
Second
,
the
main
action
that
tells
me
we
think
it’s
going
to
be
ok
is
the
ubiquity
of
following
a
pre
ordained
path
without
much
if
any
personalization
.
It’s
been
most
obvious
watching
my
fellow
first
years
and
myself
find
our
way
here
at
Duke
,
but
not
that
much
less
obvious
among
the
older
years
.
You
are
free
to
read
,
following
a
crowd
as
the
action
I
am
writing
of
,
dear
reader
.
Third
,
the
small
examples
that
inspired
my
original
thinking
here
are
simply
parts
of
the
larger
web
of
potential
paths
that
every
Duke
student
can
choose
to
go
down
.
Lots
of
them
run
something
like
this
study
hard
in
college
,
party
to
make
it
through
,
get
a
good
job
,
make
a
lot
of
money
.
But
there
are
plenty
of
other
paths
,
like
don’t
get
too
stressed
about
college
or
grades
,
make
good
friends
,
find
a
major
you’re
interested
,
get
a
job
that
you
like
and
that
can
support
you
.
I
intend
to
be
writing
about
all
of
these
paths
.
Which
leads
me
to
the
point
where
I
must
say
,
to
my
own
dismay
,
it’s
not
all
going
to
be
ok
.
You
probably
already
agree
with
this
,
but
here
are
two
reasons
why
it
seems
so
to
me
.
First
,
there
is
the
whole
climate
change
or
insert
your
world
crisis
of
choice
situation
.
Second
,
there
is
the
much
more
spatially
and
temporally
proximate
issue
of
mental
health
.
As
was
just
recently
reported
in
the
nbsp
;
Chronicle
,
according
to
the
APA
,
41
.
9
of
college
students
live
with
anxiety
and
36
.
4
live
with
depression
.
Living
with
anxiety
or
depression
need
not
mean
that
your
life
is
awful
,
but
it
seems
safe
to
say
that
we
would
all
rather
avoid
either
of
those
diagnoses
.
Relatedly
,
I
was
told
in
O
week
that
80
of
Duke
students
report
being
lonely
or
very
lonely
here
.
I
have
been
totally
unable
to
verify
this
statistic
,
and
I
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
it’s
actually
so
high
,
but
,
regardless
of
the
number
,
loneliness
does
seem
to
be
widespread
here
at
Duke
.
In
times
past
,
it
wasn’t
so
obvious
that
no
one
really
knew
what
they
were
doing
or
whether
they
were
harming
the
world
.
But
now
,
with
mental
health
issues
affecting
college
students
of
every
walk
of
life
and
climate
change
coming
to
seem
like
a
force
out
of
our
control
,
we
must
see
what
has
long
been
true
no
one
really
knows
what
they
are
doing
.
So
what
does
this
all
mean
?
I’m
not
quite
sure
,
but
it
most
importantly
suggests
to
me
that
we
need
some
more
creativity
in
how
we
go
about
our
lives
here
at
Duke
.
Watching
how
others
go
about
things
shouldn’t
be
thrown
out
the
window
,
but
I
think
that
we
must
be
more
reticent
to
set
ourselves
down
one
of
the
traditional
paths
,
given
that
these
traditional
lives
aren’t
necessarily
leading
to
great
things
!
What
invariably
happens
to
me
,
though
,
is
that
whenever
I
find
myself
critiquing
others
,
I
realize
that
I
have
just
projected
my
problem
onto
another
and
am
critiquing
them
.
For
I
am
certainly
no
saint
,
and
I
certainly
follow
a
crowd
and
my
actions
reveal
that
I’m
complicit
in
most
of
the
world’s
great
problems
and
that
I
think
that
I
will
live
a
good
life
if
I
just
check
off
the
boxes
fit
myself
into
the
boxes
,
that
is
.
Which
brings
me
to
my
last
point
,
a
slight
deviance
from
my
main
thesis
,
dear
reader
.
nbsp
;
Part
of
the
way
out
of
acting
like
everything
will
be
ok
and
following
a
crowd
is
to
realize
that
no
one
really
belongs
in
any
crowd
.

Because
every
jock
that
I’ve
known
from
high
school
till
college
isn’t
actually
a
jock
.
For
the
category
jock
isn’t
actually
made
to
represent
a
real
person
,
but
rather
a
flat
one
dimensional
character
that
only
belongs
in
comedy
movies
.
Every
pre
ordained
path
is
like
this
.
It
is
made
to
fit
an
unreal
person
who
isn’t
anyone
that
you
could
actually
ever
meet
.
Humans
,
to
me
,
are
infinitely
complex
which
means
that
any
finite
set
of
boxes
will
never
be
able
to
meet
all
of
their
needs
.
But
please
don’t
take
this
to
be
some
praise
of
individualism
or
interpersonal
isolation
!
It
isn’t
.
I
do
hope
,
though
,
to
suggest
that
by
recognizing
that
we
can
never
fit
our
whole
selves
into
any
of
the
common
life
paths
in
the
first
place
,
we
are
prompted
to
be
creative
and
develop
a
path
personalized
to
the
time
and
place
one
is
living
in
and
the
needs
and
wants
that
one
has
.
Maybe
this
starts
as
straightforwardly
as
including
religious
faith
and
charitable
giving
in
one’s
finance
career
,
I’m
not
sure
.
Which
means
that
we
must
admit
that
we
don’t
know
if
everything
is
going
to
be
ok
!
For
no
one
has
ever
done
just
what
we
are
going
to
do
.
We’re
going
into
the
future
,
after
all
.
I’d
like
to
close
with
some
words
that
I
don’t
fully
understand
yet
,
but
that
I
like
We
are
living
our
lives
as
an
answer
,
but
we
don’t
know
what
the
prompting
question
was
because
it
was
posed
before
we
were
born
.
Anyone
who
finds
themselves
in
this
position
must
uncover
that
question
before
they
go
any
further
.
Integrity
is
often
thought
of
as
an
innate
characteristic
,
featured
in
sayings
like
He
has
a
strong
moral
compass
or
It
just
didn’t
feel
like
the
right
thing
to
do
.
Yet
,
this
sense
of
honor
must
come
from
somewhere
,
and
in
many
cases
,
it
is
parents
or
guardians
that
instill
children
with
a
sense
of
moral
duty
.
This
sentiment
might
be
derived
from
a
rich
cultural
heritage
,
handed
down
through
generations
,
or
fabricated
from
a
guardian’s
personal
experiences
.
Regardless
of
origin
,
this
first
definition
of
honor
can
have
an
immeasurable
impact
on
a
child’s
beliefs
and
actions
.
As
these
children
become
young
adults
,
many
question
and
analyze
their
place
in
the
world
and
their
system
of
values
.
The
idea
of
integrity
certainly
raises
many
questions
Is
there
one
universal
standard
?
What
is
my
personal
standard
?
How
do
I
interact
with
people
who
have
different
definitions
of
honor
?
Teenagers
may
begin
to
ponder
these
ideas
in
high
school
,
but
in
college
,
they
are
thrust
into
the
spotlight
.
.
.
Suddenly
,
students
are
surrounded
with
more
diversity
of
opinions
and
backgrounds
than
ever
and
are
certain
to
encounter
people
who
view
honor
in
different
ways
.
Three
main
outcomes
may
occur
students’
familial
,
innate
ideas
of
integrity
may
be
reinforced
,
students’
innate
ideas
of
integrity
may
be
refined
,
or
students’
innate
ideas
of
integrity
may
be
replaced
.
Yet
,
while
each
individual
struggles
internally
to
define
honor
and
set
moral
standards
,
a
greater
question
looms
does
the
overarching
Duke
community
ascribe
to
a
single
definition
of
honor
,
and
if
so
,
what
is
it
?
Certainly
,
Duke
students
are
held
to
the
Community
Standard
,
a
document
that
provides
a
framework
for
integrity
but
leaves
room
for
some
personal
interpretation
.
Beyond
the
community
standard
,
though
,
is
there
a
certain
culture
or
community
of
honor
that
students
,
faculty
,
and
staff
have
an
obligation
to
promote
?
Or
,
is
honor
an
internal
,
deeply
personal
and
private
choice
?
Regardless
of
the
answer
to
these
questions
,
engaging
in
meaningful
conversations
about
ethics
and
integrity
can
help
define
personal
and
community
ideals
.
So
,
I
leave
the
reader
with
a
challenge
.
Investigate
the
sense
of
integrity
that
your
family
or
early
life
experiences
instilled
you
with
,
and
compare
it
to
the
definition
of
honor
to
which
you
currently
ascribe
.
Then
,
look
beyond
yourself
and
into
the
Duke
community
,
and
compare
your
personal
values
to
those
of
the
university
at
large
.
Finally
,
ask
someone
else
to
share
their
answers
to
these
questions
.
It
is
surprising
how
much
you
can
learn
about
a
peer
or
professor
simply
from
asking
them
about
how
their
definition
of
honor
has
changed
with
time
,
as
moral
character
is
tied
to
every
aspect
of
life
,
from
family
to
friendships
,
from
work
to
play
,
and
from
the
individual
to
the
community
.
Did
the
Pratt
School
of
Engineering’s
namesake
believe
in
integrity
over
image
?
Duke
is
undeniably
one
of
the
best
engineering
schools
in
the
country
.
This
reputation
wouldn’t
have
been
possible
if
it
wasn’t
for
Edmund
T
.
Pratt
Jr
.
’s
generous
endowment
of
35
million
.
This
gift
deemed
him
the
namesake
of
the
School
of
Engineering
and
ensured
that
he
would
be
remembered
.
But
what
do
we
remember
him
for
?
His
generous
donation
?
His
ability
to
take
raise
Pfizer’s
revenues
sevenfold
in
his
time
as
CEO
?
Or
do
we
remember
him
for
his
involvement
in
a
company
that
consistently
chose
over
integrity
?
In
Pratt’s
years
as
CEO
of
Pfizer
,
the
company
was
involved
in
a
major
scandal
.
In
the
1980s
,
Pfizer
sold
heart
valves
to
thousands
of
patients
,
hundreds
of
whom
died
from
the
valve
fracturing
.
In
Pratt’s
last
year
as
CEO
,
it
was
uncovered
that
the
company
had
deliberately
withheld
information
from
the
government
in
an
attempt
to
get
the
heart
valve
approved
for
the
market
faster
.
In
other
words
,
Pfizer
knowingly
allowed
over
31
,
370
of
these
deadly
medical
devices
to
be
implanted
in
patients
,
killing
hundreds
in
the
process
.
It
would
be
unfair
to
blame
this
tragedy
entirely
on
Pratt
.
He
was
not
directly
responsible
for
what
occurred
.
Even
after
Pratt
left
his
position
as
CEO
,
Pfizer
continued
to
bury
itself
under
mountains
of
accusations
and
lawsuits
.
In
1996
Pfizer
conducted
an
unauthorized
clinical
trial
on
200
children
in
Nigeria
involving
a
meningitis
drug
,
Trovan
.
After
the
death
of
eleven
children
and
causing
paralysis
,
blindness
,
or
deafness
in
many
more
,
Pfizer
still
put
the
drug
on
the
market
.
After
this
drug
had
been
given
to
millions
of
people
,
the
FDA
finally
labeled
it
as
dangerous
.
The
drug
had
to
be
withdrawn
from
the
U
.
S
.
market
.
Additionally
,
in
2012
,
Pfizer
was
sued
for
misbranding
its
drug
Protonix
for
the
sake
of
profits
,
and
sued
again
in
2016
for
overcharging
Medicaid
for
it
.
These
are
only
a
few
of
the
many
scandals
Pfizer
has
been
involved
to
date
.
It
is
clear
that
Pfizer
consistently
made
and
still
makes
choices
that
value
the
image
of
prosperity
over
the
integrity
demanded
by
true
promotion
of
patient
well
being
.
We
may
never
know
the
extent
of
Pratt’s
involvement
in
Pfizer’s
scandals
during
his
time
as
CEO
.
But
the
question
remains
was
the
money
he
donated
legitimately
earned
if
hundreds
of
patients
suffered
in
the
name
of
profit
?
Regardless
of
how
we
choose
to
remember
Edmund
T
.
Pratt
Jr
.
,
there
is
a
great
and
tragic
irony
in
this
situation
.
Duke
prides
itself
on
being
the
first
university
to
offer
a
biomedical
engineering
department
.
Not
only
that
,
Duke
ranks
3
in
the
country
for
best
undergraduate
biomedical
engineering
programs
,
and
5
in
the
world
for
best
biomedical
engineering
programs
as
a
whole
.
Every
year
many
of
the
students
who
graduate
from
Duke’s
biomedical
engineering
program
go
into
the
medical
device
industry
.
With
the
history
of
Pratt’s
endowment
in
mind
,
many
of
these
alumni
will
be
faced
with
ethical
dilemmas
that
could
put
thousands
of
lives
at
risk
.
For
this
reason
,
it
is
imperative
that
Duke
instills
a
strong
sense
of
integrity
over
image
into
its
students
.
But
biomedical
engineers
are
not
the
only
ones
that
will
have
to
make
this
choice
.
This
is
a
choice
we
all
need
to
make
.
And
it
is
a
choice
worth
making
.
I
was
,
begrudgingly
,
in
yoga
class
again
.
I
don’t
like
yoga
very
much
.
I
am
almost
always
uncomfortable
in
class
,
not
just
because
even
some
of
the
most
careful
yoga
practices
in
the
United
States
fall
into
the
trap
of
whitewashing
,
commercialization
and
cultural
appropriation
,
but
because
I
am
almost
always
uncomfortable
in
general
.
Chronic
pain
makes
most
exercise
unbearable
,
but
the
combination
of
breathing
,
meditation
and
self
direction
of
yoga
has
been
able
to
bring
me
back
to
class
every
week
despite
my
misgivings
.
One
mitigatory
approach
is
the
habit
of
setting
an
intention
before
practicing
.
It’s
helpful
,
especially
in
a
practice
that
is
both
healing
and
painful
,
to
have
something
to
go
back
to
when
my
pain
or
my
busy
mind
draw
me
away
from
my
movements
,
my
breath
.
I
used
to
rack
my
brain
for
an
intention
,
ashamed
that
I
couldn’t
think
of
anything
other
than
maybe
wanting
to
be
home
in
my
pajamas
rather
than
sitting
on
a
mat
on
a
floor
somewhere
.
But
after
I
found
out
this
year
that
my
pain
was
going
to
be
permanent
,
it
was
as
if
my
body
came
up
with
one
by
itself
.
There
are
two
things
there
.
One
of
the
intentions
is
to
love
my
body
;
one
of
them
is
to
think
of
it
as
good
.
Neither
are
easy
for
a
body
in
pain
.
We’ll
start
with
the
good
.
It
doesn’t
take
a
detective
to
scroll
through
Netflix
offerings
,
Instagram
ads
,
or
TV
channels
and
notice
the
way
that
white
,
cisgendered
,
straight
,
United
States
born
,
wealthy
,
thin
and
able
bodies
are
considered
desirable
and
good
,
while
bodies
that
deviate
from
these
privileged
identities
are
considered
undesirable
and
bad
.
Nor
does
it
take
a
detective
to
notice
the
way
that
this
media
bias
is
a
reflection
of
structural
violence
,
the
way
that
our
government
,
our
institutions
and
our
culture
hate
,
harm
and
punish
those
bodies
that
are
black
,
brown
,
trans
,
queer
,
immigrant
,
materially
poor
,
fat
bodied
or
disabled
.
We
are
steeped
in
a
culture
that
finds
only
a
few
very
privileged
bodies
good
;
the
necessary
intervention
,
then
,
is
not
only
to
advocate
in
all
levels
of
society
for
structural
change
that
protects
and
makes
life
possible
for
marginalized
people
,
but
also
to
foster
a
counterculture
that
insists
on
the
goodness
of
every
body
.
In
learning
to
think
of
my
body
as
good
,
I
found
myself
intentionally
changing
my
language
,
shifting
it
away
from
loving
the
parts
of
my
body
that
are
in
accordance
with
hegemonic
beauty
standards
toward
more
ability
focused
,
skills
oriented
language
.
In
other
words
,
I
started
looking
below
skin
deep
factors
to
find
a
basis
for
my
self
love
.
But
even
this
shift
,
away
from
my
body
is
good
because
it
looks
good
toward
my
body
is
good
because
it
can
do
good
things
is
not
enough
.
I
don’t
mean
to
suggest
that
celebrating
what
is
beautiful
and
capable
and
life
giving
about
our
bodies
is
unequivocally
bad
quite
the
contrary
.
But
linking
my
body’s
goodness
with
its
ability
is
a
fraught
and
dangerous
thing
to
do
because
our
human
bodies
are
never
entirely
able
.
My
own
ability
has
always
fluctuated
.
I
lived
through
five
years
of
wearing
a
back
brace
,
through
three
surgeries
,
through
months
of
hard
recovery
,
through
countless
rounds
of
physical
therapy
.
Even
this
month
,
when
my
pain
flared
up
,
I
was
reminded
of
how
quickly
my
body
can
go
from
being
able
to
perform
in
such
a
way
that
it
passes
as
fully
able
bodied
to
laying
in
bed
,
in
intense
pain
,
suddenly
unable
to
do
most
of
that
which
I
pride
myself
on
being
able
to
do
.

But
unless
a
person
dies
very
young
and
very
suddenly
,
every
person
alive
will
experience
a
moment
of
aging
or
illness
,
where
their
bodies
fail
them
in
one
way
or
another
.
If
your
body’s
goodness
is
wrapped
up
in
its
abilities
,
then
the
moment
your
body
loses
its
ability
,
your
belief
in
its
goodness
evaporates
,
too
.
In
my
religion
,
we
are
taught
that
when
God
created
human
beings
,
God
made
them
in
God’s
own
image
and
called
all
of
them
good
.
There
are
no
stipulations
on
ability
status
,
and
it
is
not
hard
to
see
why
it
would
be
inhumane
and
cruel
to
say
that
very
old
,
very
young
or
mentally
or
physically
disabled
bodies
are
not
fundamentally
good
.
And
yet
my
understanding
of
my
own
body’s
fundamental
goodness
was
contingent
upon
its
abilities
.
I
had
been
unconsciously
feeding
into
the
ableist
,
capitalistic
and
wrong
notion
that
human
bodies
are
good
only
when
they
are
able
.
My
body
is
good
not
because
it
is
beautiful
and
not
because
it
is
able
;
it
is
good
because
all
bodies
are
good
.
But
there’s
still
this
love
thing
.
Sure
,
this
body
is
theoretically
,
inherently
good
,
but
how
could
I
love
a
body
that
hurts
?
Last
week
,
I
was
back
on
a
yoga
mat
,
begrudgingly
.
I
had
spent
the
past
few
days
in
bed
,
feeling
no
love
for
this
good
body
that
hurt
me
so
.
Every
time
I
moved
the
left
side
of
my
body
in
class
,
I
wanted
to
cry
out
in
pain
.
I
had
returned
to
child’s
pose
for
the
fourth
time
when
,
like
the
intention
of
a
thought
arose
,
unbidden
,
in
my
body
.
I
shifted
positions
,
tuning
out
whatever
pose
everyone
else
in
the
class
was
doing
.
What
is
it
that
my
body
is
trying
to
tell
me
?
There’s
a
good
chance
that
my
mind
had
plagiarized
the
words
of
spoken
word
poet
Andrea
Gibson
,
because
their
words
arrived
to
me
next
Everything
is
a
lesson
.
Lesson
one
through
infinity
you
will
never
have
a
greater
opportunity
to
learn
to
love
your
enemy
than
when
your
enemy
is
your
own
red
blood
.
A
body
in
pain
is
still
a
wise
,
good
body
.
It
knows
that
it
hurts
.
It
knows
it
deserves
love
anyway
.
And
it
knows
that
if
everything
is
a
lesson
,
then
this
pain
is
one
,
too
.
Learning
to
love
this
good
body
may
be
the
greatest
lesson
I
ever
learn
.
The
motto
of
Duke
University
is
me
what
my
religion
is
,
I
say
that
I
am
a
Hindu
.
While
growing
up
in
Atlanta
,
I
generally
attended
Hindu
festivals
and
went
to
Hindu
temples
.
But
I
also
identified
with
Christianity
,
the
religion
of
most
of
my
friends
,
if
they
had
any
religion
at
all
.
Atheism
was
also
common
among
the
people
I
spent
time
with
and
there
were
some
areas
where
my
understanding
of
science
conflicted
with
what
any
religious
tradition
around
me
said
.
For
example
,
is
it
possible
to
be
Christian
and
simultaneously
believe
in
the
Theory
of
Evolution
?
Since
at
least
middle
school
I
felt
somewhat
connected
to
both
Christianity
and
Hinduism
,
but
separated
from
both
of
them
as
well
.
I
brought
this
religious
ambiguity
with
me
when
I
came
to
Duke
.
I
have
not
been
here
long
enough
to
say
if
my
time
at
Duke
has
radically
changed
my
outlook
on
religion
,
or
on
anything
else
.
However
,
I
think
that
I
came
a
little
bit
closer
to
understanding
my
own
relationship
to
religion
over
fall
break
,
where
I
went
to
a
Hindu
celebration
called
Durga
Puja
back
home
in
Atlanta
.
I
have
attended
Durga
Pujas
all
my
life
,
but
the
fact
that
it
was
happening
that
week
did
not
even
occur
to
me
until
the
day
it
actually
happened
.
The
ceremony
itself
took
place
in
a
converted
high
school
cafeteria
in
Gwinnett
County
,
more
than
an
hour
from
our
home
.
I
listened
to
the
drumming
and
the
blowing
of
the
conch
shell
,
and
I
briefly
admired
the
decorated
idols
.
I
attended
an
Anjali
service
.
This
consists
of
clutching
some
petals
in
your
hands
and
repeating
a
long
list
of
Sanskrit
words
,
most
of
whose
meanings
we
did
not
understand
,
after
the
priest
.
I
was
hungry
,
impatient
for
dinner
to
begin
.
The
priest
was
talking
too
fast
;
I
barely
had
time
to
pronounce
the
longer
Sanskrit
words
before
he
moved
on
to
the
next
word
.
I
did
not
feel
especially
holy
or
connected
to
God
.
However
,
the
evening
wasn’t
done
after
the
Anjali
.
After
the
ceremony
and
a
very
spicy
dinner
,
there
was
a
performance
by
a
well
known
Bengali
pop
star
from
my
parents’
generation
.
He
sang
songs
in
Bengali
nbsp
;
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
religion
including
a
bilingual
cover
of
Louis
Armstrong’s
What
a
Wonderful
World
.
Many
of
the
audience
members
,
sang
along
with
his
songs
.
They
were
clearly
enjoying
themselves
and
excited
about
the
prospect
of
hearing
in
person
someone
who
was
a
major
celebrity
when
they
were
younger
.
It
was
clear
that
for
at
least
some
of
the
people
there
,
including
my
parents
,
the
main
attraction
was
the
singer
,
not
the
ceremony
.
I
heard
my
mother
talking
about
the
singer
before
we
even
got
to
the
celebration
.
This
reveals
something
important
about
my
family’s
religion
for
us
,
religion
was
not
mainly
about
praying
to
Gods
or
about
following
rules
.
We
rarely
go
to
the
Hindu
Temple
,
and
we
do
not
follow
Hindu
dietary
restrictions
.
For
my
family
,
Hinduism
is
largely
about
remembering
our
past
and
about
celebrating
our
heritage
as
Indians
and
members
of
the
Bengali
ethnic
group
.
That
is
not
to
say
that
there
was
no
spiritual
aspect
of
my
family’s
religion
my
parents
kept
a
statue
of
Ganesh
above
their
bedroom
door
when
I
was
a
kid
,
and
they
taught
me
to
make
a
gesture
of
apology
to
Saraswati
,
goddess
of
learning
,
whenever
I
inadvertently
stepped
on
a
book
.
But
for
the
most
part
,
our
observances
of
Hinduism
occurred
either
on
events
of
family
significance
,
such
as
birthdays
of
deceased
relatives
,
or
on
occasions
which
allowed
opportunities
to
engage
with
the
Bengali
community
,
such
as
Durga
Puja
.
Understanding
this
reminds
us
that
religion
can
come
from
many
places
.
But
I
feel
this
can
also
help
explain
my
religious
confusion
growing
up
.
My
religious
feeling
as
a
Hindu
was
weak
not
only
because
my
family’s
relative
lack
of
religiosity
,
but
also
because
Hinduism
was
tied
to
my
Indian
and
Bengali
identity
.
And
living
in
a
neighborhood
that
was
eighty
five
percent
white
and
where
I
had
exactly
one
Indian
friend
in
middle
school
,
my
Indian
identity
was
not
that
strong
either
.
I
don’t
want
to
imply
that
my
family’s
religion
is
defective
or
somehow
inferior
to
other
types
of
religion
.
Many
people
are
perfectly
happy
and
comfortable
seeing
religion
primary
as
a
vehicle
for
social
or
ethnic
identity
.
In
my
case
,
however
,
the
religion
of
my
childhood
left
plenty
of
space
for
spiritual
confusion
.
Confusion
,
though
,
can
be
an
opportunity
.
Here
at
Duke
,
I
will
have
lots
of
opportunities
to
explore
my
religion
.
This
includes
not
just
the
spiritual
aspect
of
religion
,
but
also
the
communal
part
what
it
is
like
to
be
part
of
a
community
of
faith
and
connection
.
I
have
already
begun
to
expand
my
religious
horizons
,
attending
several
Christian
and
Jewish
services
.
I
do
not
know
the
future
;
it
is
possible
that
my
entire
life
will
be
defined
by
religious
confusion
.
At
Duke
,
however
,
it
is
possible
that
I
can
more
fully
explore
both
halves
of
our
motto
developing
my
own
religion
while
learning
at
a
great
university
.
It’s
five
weeks
deep
into
the
semester
and
the
first
round
of
midterms
has
already
come
and
gone
.
Throughout
the
week
,
I
frequented
the
first
floor
of
Perkins
,
where
a
sea
of
hunched
figures
,
coffee
,
textbooks
,
and
glowing
laptop
screens
greeted
me
as
I
hit
my
own
late
night
grinds
.
I
throw
off
my
50
pound
backpack
with
relief
,
grab
a
seat
,
and
toss
my
textbooks
,
which
amount
to
a
whopping
600
dollar
cumulative
retail
value
,
on
the
table
without
a
second
thought
.
After
weeks
of
neglect
,
my
many
purchases
in
the
DukeStore
during
drop
add
finally
saw
the
light
of
day
.
Still
,
not
everyone
has
the
luxury
of
hurling
their
exorbitantly
priced
materials
across
a
table
in
Perkins
with
agitation
.
In
fact
,
many
students
refrain
from
purchasing
their
books
altogether
.
Course
costs
pose
a
barrier
not
only
to
student
outcomes
once
they’re
in
a
class
,
but
actively
impact
students’
self
determinism
in
the
course
selection
process
.
Because
of
the
imposition
of
financial
restraints
,
a
student
may
opt
to
take
classes
with
more
affordable
materials
.
In
an
institution
that
prizes
free
reign
to
explore
intellectually
without
barriers
,
this
compromise
that
students
are
cornered
into
is
unacceptable
.
This
lack
of
consumerism
can
be
attributed
to
the
growth
of
shadow
libraries
the
black
market
of
course
materials
which
bypass
the
actual
purchase
of
materials
by
way
of
textbook
pdf
circulation
,
online
databases
and
other
sharing
platforms
.
But
it’s
also
a
consequence
of
the
general
inflated
costs
endemic
to
higher
education
over
the
past
few
decades
.
The
problem
isn’t
exclusive
to
Duke
either
.
In
a
national
survey
,
about
80
of
respondents
reported
that
they
had
waited
to
purchase
course
materials
until
after
the
class
had
started
and
42
said
they
had
avoided
purchasing
the
course
materials
altogether
.
We
truly
are
in
an
access
crisis
,
said
Richard
Baraniuk
,
professor
at
Rice
University
and
founder
of
OpenStax
,
a
nonprofit
that
provides
access
to
free
online
versions
of
textbooks
.
Notwithstanding
the
obvious
fact
that
courses
are
growing
increasingly
more
expensive
,
it’s
also
an
issue
when
assumed
required
class
materials
actually
end
up
being
optional
.
It’s
a
flaw
in
the
course
design
if
the
class
materials
are
not
continually
evaluated
for
relevancy
.
But
beyond
the
course
by
course
level
,
dependence
on
traditional
forms
of
course
materials
pose
higher
systemic
issues
,
most
notable
being
the
monopoly
publishers
purvey
over
standardized
knowledge
.
Five
publishers
Pearson
Education
,
Scholastic
,
McGraw
Hill
Education
,
Cengage
Learning
,
Houghton
Mifflin
Harcourt
control
an
astounding
80
of
the
textbook
industry
.
What
can
actually
be
done
,
though
?
Classes
demand
structured
curriculum
and
textbooks
serve
to
streamline
knowledge
so
that
professors
are
able
to
employ
their
discretion
when
paving
through
material
.
Last
semester
,
I
participated
in
a
Spring
Breakthrough
program
called
Hack
Your
Education
Design
Sprint
.
It
was
a
several
day
problem
solving
workshop
that
revolved
around
issues
affecting
the
greater
Duke
undergraduate
community
.
The
session
kicked
off
with
a
reverse
pitch
,
where
our
team
listened
to
representatives
spanning
the
institution
on
a
wide
purview
of
topics
.
Dave
Hansen
,
Associate
University
Librarian
for
Research
Collections
and
Scholarly
Communication
,
pitched
on
the
allocation
of
university
resources
to
help
mitigate
course
costs
.
Deeply
disturbed
at
the
hurdles
students
leap
through
in
order
to
acquire
their
books
,
we
unanimously
resolved
to
take
on
this
critical
problem
.
Signup

our
editorially
curated

weekly

Cancel

any

.
In
a
survey
our
team
sent
out
to
a
sample
of
the
undergraduate
student
body
,
many
expressed
the
struggle
to
navigate
nebulous
backwaters
to
get
the
materials
they
need
for
class
.
One
student
wrote
in
an
anonymous
statement
that
they
often
end
up
downloading
illegal
copies
of
textbooks
since
second
hand
books
are
too
costly
.
I
wish
there
was
another
way
for
me
to
access
the
information
for
free
,
they
said
.
Others
felt
disillusioned
by
the
hefty
fees
.
I
was
just
blindsided
by
all
of
these
costs
,
in
all
honesty
.
But
these
costs
transcend
solely
textbook
fees
.
Students
often
find
themselves
drowning
in
subscription
,
software
,
and
other
miscellaneous
lab
fees
.
In
the
past
decade
,
the
integration
of
technology
in
the
classroom
has
skyrocketed
.
And
because
of
this
rapid
digitization
of
the
21st
century
learning
environment
,
textbook
publishing
companies
have
been
implementing
compensatory
means
to
maintain
relevance
from
cranking
up
subscription
fees
to
churning
out
new
editions
.
Part
of
the
fear
stems
from
legitimate
concern
that
their
resources
are
becoming
somewhat
obsolete
.
Online
tools
are
dynamic
,
easily
modifiable
,
and
widely
accessible
.
At
the
end
of
the
Spring
Breakthrough
,
we
explored
potential
solutions
assuaging
the
burden
of
hiked
course
costs
.
And
from
our
findings
,
open
Educational
Resources
OER
,
a
growing
medium
of
course
materials
,
has
the
potential
to
transform
learning
in
higher
education
.
OER
are
any
type
of
open
licensed
educational
material
.
Anyone
can
legally
and
freely
use
,
adapt
,
and
re
share
the
content
.
By
democratizing
,
standardizing
,
and
generating
knowledge
through
OER
,
universities
can
pool
their
intellectual
resources
,
ideally
developing
an
inter
collegiate
consortium
of
class
material
.
This
would
then
reduce
higher
education’s
strict
reliance
upon
big
five
publishers
to
provide
students
with
quality
content
,
thus
fostering
more
institutional
autonomy
.
Because
at
a
university
that
wields
the
power
to
create
knowledge
,
so
does
it
also
have
the
capacity
to
curate
it
.
As
practicing
clinicians
and
scientists
,
we
write
to
express
our
concern
regarding
the
use
of
electronic
cigarettes
on
campus
,
and
to
urge
Duke
University
to
join
almost
2
,
000
US
colleges
and
universities
in
taking
a
proactive
stance
by
banning
these
products
on
the
campus
.
Our
university
and
its
host
city
Durham
have
navigated
a
long
and
fraught
relationship
with
tobacco
,
and
we
now
face
a
new
opportunity
to
impact
the
tobacco
industry’s
threats
to
local
and
world
public
health
.
Vape
manufacturers
and
marketers
have
made
excessive
claims
of
benefit
in
smoking
cessation
while
targeting
youth
,
who
are
especially
vulnerable
to
addiction
.
They
have
delivered
unhealthy
and
misleading
information
about
the
safety
of
these
products
,
which
the
FDA
has
failed
to
regulate
.
The
most
recent
Duke
policy
of
April
2019
has
deferred
a
decision
regarding
e
cigarettes
and
vaping
on
campus
.
In
our
opinion
,
the
clear
and
strong
recent
local
and
national
evidence
of
the
highly
addictive
and
life
threatening
effects
of
vaping
should
motivate
students
and
staff
to
abandon
vaping
and
the
University
to
implement
a
ban
.
While
the
specific
chemical
exposures
causing
this
outbreak
remain
unknown
at
this
time
,
the
Centers
for
Disease
Control
CDC
strongly
recommends
that
young
people
not
use
e
cigarettes
or
vaping
products
,
particularly
those
containing
THC
.
Thus
,
we
urge
the
University
to
move
quickly
to
acknowledge
the
health
crisis
linked
to
vaping
and
ban
the
use
of
all
e
cigarette
products
on
our
campus
.
Odysseus
In
order
to
complete
his
quest
,
the
legendary
Greek
hero
Odysseus
must
travel
to
the
Underworld
to
meet
the
wise
prophet
Tiresias
.
So
it
goes
.
Meant
for
the
damned
souls
of
the
dead
,
the
Underworld
is
a
miserable
,
hellish
place
.
Odysseus
,
a
man
still
living
,
dreads
going
.
To
get
to
the
Underworld
,
Odysseus
must
traverse
the
River
Styx
,
a
murky
body
of
water
that
literally
translates
into
the
river
of
hate
.
It
really
isn’t
the
best
place
to
swim
.
The
only
way
for
Odysseus
to
get
across
the
River
Styx
is
to
take
a
ferry
eternal
damnation
aside
,
a
boat
service
to
Hell
sounds
pretty
cool
operated
by
Charon
,
the
ferryman
of
the
dead
.
For
the
right
price
,
Charon
would
take
dead
souls
to
the
Underworld
on
a
one
way
trip
.
Oh
,
and
if
he
didn’t
like
someone
,
Charon
could
fling
them
off
his
boat
at
any
time
.
Understandably
,
Odysseus
was
afraid
.
Thus
,
it
must
have
been
quite
perplexing
,
when
it
was
time
to
make
my
own
voyage
to
the
Underworld
,
that
I
was
strangely
excited
?
Waiting
on
the
shorelines
of
the
East
Campus
bus
stop
,
I
anticipated
my
trip
to
the
Underworld
,
or
as
most
people
call
it
Duke
University
West
Campus
.
Stepping
on
to
the
C1
bus
,
the
driver
didn’t
even
expect
payment
.
the
march
upwards
that
will
always
follow
.
More
than
half
a
millennium
ago
,
in
1492
,
Christopher
Columbus
sailed
the
ocean
blue
as
the
common
elementary
poem
goes
.
This
past
Monday
,
the
federally
recognized
holiday
Columbus
Day
celebrated
his
arrival
to
and
discovery
of
the
Americas
.
What
the
poem
and
the
holiday
fail
to
reflect
,
however
,
is
how
Columbus
got
lost
and
ended
up
on
Indigenous
land
only
to
leave
in
his
wake
horrifying
and
devastating
legacies
of
mass
genocide
,
rape
and
sexual
exploitation
,
enslavement
and
land
seizure
.
To
correct
the
gross
celebration
of
genocidal
settler
colonialism
and
to
instead
recenter
Indigenous
histories
and
communities
,
many
states
and
cities
have
moved
towards
the
celebration
of
Indigenous
Peoples’
Day
instead
.
Historical
commemorative
holidays
usually
look
back
and
reflect
upon
the
past
.
In
this
shift
,
it
is
important
to
note
that
Indigenous
Peoples’
Day
is
not
only
a
recognition
of
and
reflection
on
history
,
but
also
a
reckoning
with
the
ongoing
and
invisible
issues
that
Native
Americans
face
.
Today
,
there
are
more
than
five
hundred
federally
recognized
Indigenous
nations
that
makes
up
nearly
three
million
people
,
descendants
of
the
fifteen
million
Native
people
who
once
inhabited
the
United
States
.
As
a
result
of
land
seizures
of
over
1
.
5
billion
acres
,
isolation
by
reservations
and
environmental
destruction
,
Native
Americans
experience
high
poverty
and
incarceration
rates
,
low
educational
attainment
and
alarming
health
disparities
related
to
diabetes
,
alcohol
related
and
drug
induced
deaths
.
Despite
centuries
of
violence
and
erasure
,
Native
Americans
are
reclaiming
their
narrative
and
calling
upon
allies
to
amplify
Native
voices
and
stories
about
Indigenous
resistance
and
resilience
.
However
,
the
few
Indigenous
news
stories
that
make
it
onto
timelines
and
news
feeds
tend
to
be
based
on
stereotypes
or
only
relevant
to
allies
that
find
common
ground
with
certain
issues
such
as
environmental
justice
.
This
is
convenient
for
liberals
who
already
believe
in
environmental
preservation
and
sustainable
land
use
and
subsequently
co
opt
the
movement
.
Meanwhile
,
these
allies’
remain
willfully
or
unintentionally
silent
around
issues
that
do
not
directly
impact
them
,
contributing
to
the
erasure
of
the
multifaceted
Indigenous
experiences
.
On

,

,
the
only
readily
available
recognition
of
Indigenious
Peoples’
Day
from
Duke
University
could
be
found
in
a
tweet
from
the
Duke
University
Archives’
Twitter
page
.
Although
it
may
be
little
known
,
there
exists
a
valuable
long
standing
history
and
presence
of
Native
Americans
at
Duke
that
deserves
much
greater
recognition
.
Beneath
the
glass
boxes
and
beyond
the
Gothic
architecture
,
the
Community
Editorial
Board
acknowledges
that
the
Duke
University
campuses
sit
on
the
occupied
land
of
the
Catawaba
and
Shakori
Peoples
who
have
stewarded
this
land
for
generations
.
In
1880
,
at
a
time
when
Trinity
College
struggled
financially
,
twelve
children
from
the
Eastern
band
of
the
Cherokee
nation
were
admitted
into
Trinity
College’s
Cherokee
Industrial
School
.
This
was
the
result
of
the
College
taking
advantage
of
an
assimilationist
federal
policy
established
by
the
Bureau
of
Indian
Affairs
which
paid
educational
institutions
to
clothe
,
board
and
provide
education
to
Native
American
children
,
mostly
boys
and
some
as
young
as
eight
years
old
.
This
lasted
for
almost
five
years
before
Joseph
Maytubby
,
a
member
of
the
Chickasaw
nation
from
Oklahoma
,
entered
Trinity
College
in
1892
and
became
the
first
Native
American
student
to
graduate
from
Trinity
College
in
1896
.
North
Carolina
is
home
to
the
largest
Native
American
population
east
of
the
Mississippi
River
and
the
eighth
largest
Native
population
in
the
United
States
.
This
contrasts
sharply
with
the
statistic
that
Native
American
students
make
up
2
of
the
undergraduate
population
for
the
class
of
2022
,
but
Duke
does
not
require
verification
of
students’
Indigenous
heritage
affiliation
when
they
apply
.
In
spite
of
the
lack
of
visibility
and
Duke's
deliberate
or
ignorant
silence
in
confronting
its
colonial
history
,
Native
students
are
actively
working
to
decolonize
and
reclaim
their
space
.
It
has
only
been
in
recent
years
that
cultural
space
and
recognition
has
emerged
such
as
the
Wekit
,
a
new
space
in
the
Center
for
Multicultural
Affairs
in
the
Bryan
Center
for
the
Native
American
Student
Alliance
and
Native
students
on
campus
.
However
,
even
this
designation
of
space
to
Native
students
speaks
to
the
colonial
nature
of
the
institution
what
does
it
mean
for
the
University
which
sits
on
stolen
,
occupied
land
to
afford
a
slice
of
its
space
back
to
Native
students
?
Beyond
a
physical
space
,
Native
students
have
rightfully
begun
to
ask
for
the
hire
of
Indigenous
faculty
and
the
establishment
of
Native
American
studies
.
There
have
been
calls
for
allies
to
uplift
and
make
space
for
Indigenous
voices
,
to
show
up
to
their
events
on
campus
and
within
the
community
,
to
actively
educate
themselves
on
Indigenous
culture
,
beliefs
and
history
,
and
to
avoid
appropriating
Indigenous
culture
.
The
designation
of
the
Wekit
can
only
be
the
start
of
the
University
grappling
with
its
colonial
history
,
listening
to
and
amplifying
the
struggles
and
visions
of
Indigenous
Peoples
,
and
actively
supporting
a
material
decolonial
movement
towards
reconciliation
and
self
determination
for
Indigenous
Peoples
.
Hookup
culture
dominates
the
social
scene
of
American
college
campuses
today
,
including
Duke
.
Although
most
people
reading
this
are
probably
familiar
with
the
term
,
it
is
defined
as
a
culture
that
accepts
and
encourages
casual
sex
encounters
,
including
one
night
stands
and
other
related
activity
,
without
necessarily
including
emotional
bonding
or
long
term
commitment
.
Here
at
Duke
,
I
have
overheard
complaints
about
this
culture
and
how
to
prevent
it
,
but
the
reality
is
that
it
is
a
widespread
instilled
mindset
in
adolescents
around
the
nation
that
physical
intimacy
no
longer
necessitates
emotional
intimacy
.
nbsp
;
Hookup
culture
has
integrated
its
way
into
pop
culture
and
media
and
honestly
,
it
looks
like
it’s
here
to
stay
for
the
long
term
.
In
fact
,
an
estimated
60
80
of
college
students
in
North
America
have
experienced
a
hook
up
.
And
though
hookup
culture
,
for
Duke
students
,
may
conjure
up
memories
of
questionable
nights
at
Shooters
and
late
night
walks
back
to
dorm
rooms
,
the
reality
of
this
culture
may
represent
something
more
important
than
we
initially
think
.
Hookup
culture
,
despite
its
prevalence
in
today’s
society
,
has
been
conventionally
portrayed
as
shameful
and
careless
within
the
media
.
Romantic
comedies
depict
the
regret
,
irrational
impulsivity
,
and
emotional
emptiness
of
one
night
stands
.
The
walk
of
shame
is
often
portrayed
as
a
girl
,
mascara
smudged
and
hair
messy
walking
barefoot
in
the
dress
from
the
night
before
.
While
the
traditional
perception
of
hookup
culture
may
dictate
shame
,
this
culture
may
actually
have
deeper
roots
in
a
widespread
movement
of
progressive
and
changing
sexual
norms
in
our
society
.
And
though
there
are
definite
negatives
surrounding
hookup
culture
,
like
increased
sexual
health
risk
,
one
important
aspect
we
often
fail
to
consider
is
how
it
changes
sexual
norms
in
a
way
that
makes
them
less
taboo
,
easier
to
talk
about
,
and
overall
more
transparent
.
In
order
to
gain
a
more
experienced
perspective
on
the
topic
,
I
spoke
to
Professor
Taylor
Black
,
an
Assistant
Professor
in
Gender
,
Sexuality
and
Feminist
Studies
at
Duke
,
who
provided
a
valuable
perspective
about
this
culture
.
He
spoke
about
how
hookup
culture
has
always
been
prevalent
within
our
society
,
yet
in
a
more
closeted
way
,
especially
among
the
queer
community
.
Now
,
however
,
hookup
culture
has
become
more
integrated
in
popular
culture
in
a
monetized
way
,
like
through
mobile
apps
,
movies
and
songs
which
normalize
and
encourage
casual
sexual
relations
between
strangers
.
Another
point
Professor
Black
made
was
how
American’s
purantical
cultural
background
which
essentially
dictates
that
sex
is
bad
,
has
made
it
difficult
to
completely
destigmatize
sexual
pleasure
in
our
society
.
When
I
asked
about
his
opinion
on
the
integration
of
hookup
culture
into
popular
culture
,
he
admitted
that
in
the
long
run
,
if
hookup
culture
helps
debunk
the
stigma
around
sexual
pleasure
,
it’s
overall
better
for
society
.
Similarly
,
besides
the
traditional
view
of
hookup
culture
portrayed
in
rom
coms
,
more
recent
mainstream
media
has
normalized
sex
in
a
non
judgemental
manner
.
Apps
like
Tinder
,
Grindr
,
and
Bumble
allow
people
to
pursue
,
among
other
types
of
relationships
,
casual
sexual
encounters
among
singles
in
their
area
.
Songs
like
One
More
Night
by
Maroon
5
,
Hotline
Bling
by
Drake
,
and
countless
others
depict
and
normalize
casual
sexual
encounters
.
This
saturation
of
hookup
culture
within
our
popular
culture
allows
the
topic
of
sex
into
a
daily
conversation
among
adolescents
in
ways
that
have
been
unacceptable
in
the
past
.
I
also
spoke
with
Professor
Gabriel
Rosenberg
,
an
associate
professor
of
Gender
,
Sexuality
,
and
Feminist
Studies
,
who
mentioned
that
although
hookup
culture
is
not
synonymous
with
sex
positivity
,
it
is
possible
that
the
integration
of
hookup
culture
into
popular
culture
has
created
new
conversations
around
sex
.
He
also
stated
that
the
popular
media
is
merely
a
reflection
of
the
prominent
way
that
hookup
culture
structures
people’s
relationship
about
sex
.
Whatever
opinion
one
has
about
hookup
culture
,
it
is
irrefutable
that
it
has
significantly
changed
the
way
that
we
think
,
act
,
and
speak
about
sex
.
Sex
is
no
longer
the
unmentionable
term
that
was
only
discussed
behind
closed
doors
,
and
the
decisions
of
individuals
to
have
sexual
encounters
are
often
no
longer
vilified
as
they
were
in
the
past
.
Normalization
of
sex
,
an
effect
of
hookup
culture
,
has
shaped
our
principles
to
be
more
accepting
of
physical
intimacy
and
sexual
diversity
.
Hookup
culture
,
on
an
individual
level
,
may
conjure
memories
of
decisions
fueled
by
impulsivity
and
desire
.
Yet
on
a
societal
level
,
this
culture
serves
as
an
integral
part
of
a
larger
sexually
progressive
movement
of
our
generation
that
seeks
to
defile
the
cloud
of
shame
around
sex
and
normalize
it
.
Alright
,
I
have
fifteen
minutes
.
Sweat
beads
down
my
forehead
as
I
storm
through
the
doors
of
Penn
Pavilion
,
darting
from
table
to
table
.
A
mountain
of
papers
rapidly
accumulated
in
my
hands
Study
Abroad
,
Academic
Resources
Center
,
Psychology
,
History
,
Public
Policy
the
list
goes
on
.
I
circled
the
perimeter
of
Penn
twice
,
making
rapid
fire
stops
to
absorb
as
much
insight
as
possible
while
knowing
that
I
had
to
run
to
my
11
45
a
.
m
.
class
in
three
minutes
.
The
Majors
Fair
came
and
went
in
a
flash
.
As
I
sped
walked
my
way
to
class
,
I
flipped
through
the
massive
stack
of
handouts
clutched
tightly
in
my
hands
.
My
mind
swept
thoughts
of
insecurity
away
,
a
momentary
respite
only
to
be
reactivated
by
an
ever
lingering
reality
I
needed
to
make
some
concrete
decisions
,
and
fast
.
Perhaps
not
so
coincidentally
,
the
Majors
Fair
acts
as
a
harbinger
for
the
spooky
and
quickly
approaching
Bookbagging
season
.
And
if
you’re
anything
like
me
,
Bookbagging
season
elapses
as
a
series
of
avoidant
behaviors
up
until
the
cusp
of
the
even
decision
dictates
the
rest
of
your
life
.
This
perception
is
imposed
culturally
.
From
the
day
we
are
thrown
onto
East
campus
as
first
years
,
the
two
questions
we
are
asked
from
the
get
go
are
Where
are
you
from
?
and
What
is
your
major
?
The
question
directly
feeds
into
the
implicit
stigmatization
of
being
undecided
.
Last
semester
,
I
was
restless
with
worry
that
I
was
undecided
,
especially
as
my
peers
began
to
shape
up
their
four
year
plans
.
Although
,
looking
back
,
it’s
a
bit
ludicrous
that
some
people
were
so
set
on
an
academic
trajectory
before
they
even
had
the
opportunity
to
take
any
classes
.
While
categorizing
yourself
into
a
major
bucket
can
be
a
heuristic
for
peers
to
gauge
interests
and
grasp
if
there
are
any
curricular
overlaps
that
are
suitable
to
form
study
groups
,
commiserate
,
or
probe
for
opportunities
there’s
not
much
,
if
any
,
added
value
to
posing
the
question
.
Rather
than
copy
and
paste
these
dull
scripts
,
I
propose
a
new
set
of
questions
,
namely
What
excites
you
?
and
What
are
you
passionate
about
?
By
asking
these
questions
,
students
can
transcend
essentializing
people
down
to
their
major
and
instead
provoke
more
meaningful
conversations
on
identity
and
areas
of
interest
.
Yes
,
these
columns
have
been
done
before
,
and
will
inevitably
be
written
again
,
but
it’s
important
to
reiterate
that
it
is
developmentally
important
and
even
normal
to
have
these
doubts
when
choosing
a
major
.
As
of
now
,
I’m
three
semesters
deep
into
my
undergraduate
experience
and
I
still
don’t
have
a
clue
what
I
want
to
major
in
.
And
that’s
okay
.
If
you
get
anything
from
this
column
,
let
it
be
validation
that
your
pace
,
your
own
academic
timeline
is
unique
to
you
,
whether
you
decide
in
the
first
month
of
classes
or
change
your
major
four
times
before
junior
fall
.
You
are
not
your
major
.
It
starts
as
a
new
healthy
habit
.
Our
heart
rate
monitors
,
glorified
pedometers
,
or
calorie
trackers
often
enter
our
lives
deceptively
innocent
,
wanting
only
to
improve
our
well
being
.
Yet
sometime
along
the
way
,
lost
in
the
she’s
just
trying
to
get
her
ten
thousand
steps
,
of
course
or
the
refusal
of
a
warm
chocolate
cookie
for
the
sake
of
a
number
,
these
health
aids
transform
into
our
masters
.
I
fear
this
same
slippery
slope
of
health
monitoring
may
be
an
unfortunate
result
of
Duke
Health’s
study
of
180
Gilbert
Addoms
first
years
.
These
students
received
Apple
Watches
or
Fitbits
in
exchange
for
participation
in
a
research
study
exploring
health
habits
.
The
objective
of
the
study
is
noble
.
Researchers
hope
to
use
sleep
,
activity
,
and
diet
data
collected
for
personalized
health
recommendations
.
One
first
year
even
noted
that
during
information
sessions
and
in
emails
,
the
researchers
tend
to
emphasize
nbsp
;
the
importance
of
mental
health
over
physical
activity
throughout
the
study
.
I
do
like
that
the
researchers
have
put
less
emphasis
on
tracking
and
more
emphasis
on
mental
health
and
stress
related
to
school
,
first
year
Ian
Acriche
said
.
I
was
relieved
to
hear
Acriche’s
words
.
Large
research
projects
too
often
undervalue
the
mental
health
of
participants
.
Yet
the
fact
that
the
researchers
felt
the
need
to
even
include
such
stringent
emphasis
on
mental
health
throughout
the
study
shows
the
inherent
mental
health
risks
in
quantifying
and
tracking
freshmen
health
for
a
year
.
The
hidden
message
measuring
your
steps
,
activity
,
sleep
,
and
diet
everyday
should
not
be
normal
.
It
is
not
natural
.
And
without
combating
it
,
these
practices
can
undermine
a
healthy
relationship
with
exercise
,
sleep
,
and
food
.
The
study
initially
focused
on
sleep
patterns
in
an
effort
to
identify
better
sleep
habits
.
Being
aware
that
one’s
sleep
is
monitored
might
lead
to
efforts
to
sleep
more
.
In
addition
to
potentially
helping
sleep
patterns
,
I
can
see
the
merit
of
this
study
in
proving
just
how
messed
up
many
of
our
sleep
schedules
are
.
The
freshmen
I
interviewed
,
however
,
all
expressed
that
their
sleep
schedules
have
not
improved
nbsp
;
since
beginning
the
study
.
As
a
first
year
,
I
am
just
trying
to
get
used
to
having
a
different
schedule
than
in
high
school
,
Acriche
said
.
I
have
the
same
bad
sleep
habits
,
but
now
my
Apple
watch
just
reminds
me
of
them
.
I
have
not
changed
my
actions
,
but
I
am
more
cognizant
of
how
much
sleep
I
am
getting
at
night
,
first
year
Kelyce
Allen
said
.
Researchers
did
not
give
the
students
simply
a
sleep
tracker
,
and
they
did
not
only
ask
for
sleep
data
.
In
addition
to
sleep
,
the
yearlong
study
includes
weekly
surveys
about
students’
diet
and
activity
levels
.
The
Apple
watch
has
the
capabilities
of
a
small
robot
with
an
impeccable
memory
and
annoyingly
effective
notification
properties
on
one’s
wrist
.
In
fact
all
the
other
capabilities
of
the
smart
watches
attract
more
attention
and
potential
obsessiveness
.
As
far
as
exercise
,
many
cited
their
watches
as
motivators
for
increased
exercise
.

Apple
watch
is
a
motivator
for
me
to
get
out
and
exercise
I
would
say
that
my
exercise
has
definitely
increased
,
first
year
Lauren
May
said
.
And
the
notification
features
of
the
watches
garnered
even
more
attention
,
sometimes
with
shameful
remarks
about
the
frequency
of
glances
toward
the
screen
.
I
check
my
watch
maybe
twenty
times
a
day
.
It
is
just
easy
for
checking
the
time
and
all
the
notifications
,
May
said
.
Let’s
just
say
that
I
check
my
heart
rate
once
an
hour
.
My
apple
watch
also
sends
me
weird
information
like
I
should
stand
up
or
move
around
sometimes
.
I’ll
just
tell
it
to
shut
up
,
Acriche

As
someone
who
has
personally
struggled
with
my
relationship
towards
food
and
exercise
partly
because
of
a
fitness
tracker
,
I
was
triggered
at
the
thought
of
a
study
requiring
first
years
to
monitor
these
metrics
.
What
if
the
study
lights
an
obsessive
tendency
in
a
student
that
could
have
been
avoided
?
Hearing
people
talk
about
increasing
exercise
for
a
watch
reminds
me
of
dark
moments
walking
around
my
backyard
to
hit
an
arbitrary
step
goal
.
I
would
not
wish
that
on
anyone
.
Yet
in
asking
questions
,
I
have
tried
to
separate
my
own
experience
with
a
fitness
tracker
and
give
room
for
potentially
positive
experiences
.
It
is
when
these
actions
become
second
nature
,
an
instinct
and
not
a
choice
that
the
watch
starts
to
gain
control
over
us
.
Freshmen
transitioning
from
high
school
to
college
are
arguably
in
the
most
formative
periods
of
their
life
.
They
deserve
to
struggle
with
their
identity
,
habits
,
self
image
,
and
relationships
without
the
crutch
of
a
quantitative
tracker
.
Moreover
,
at
what
other
point
in
your
life
is
crucial
to
form
a
sense
of
self
than
between
the
ages
of
18
and
22
?
Smart
watches
and
nbsp
;
fitness
trackers
are
not
inherently
bad
.
I
use
a
Garmin
smartwatch
to
nbsp
;
track
my
steps
,
calories
,
and
activity
levels
.
But
I
rarely
nbsp
;
check
how
many
steps
I
walked
in
a
day
,
an
insufficient
measure
of
the
day’s
healthiness
.
I
don’t
compete
or
compare
my
steps
with
those
of
my
friends
.
I
do
take
it
off
completely
at
least
once
a
week
to
let
my
skin
and
my
mind
breathe
.
I
do
check
the
time
often
every
three
minutes
during
a
biology
lecture
to
be
specific
.
It
took
a
long
time
for
me
to
get
here
.
Months
of
obsessively
wearing
and
monitoring
my
steps
and
months
of
forgetting
my
Garmin
in
the
corner
of
my
room
and
correcting
a
hideous
watch
tan
.
Now
I
feel
like
I
have
finally
reached
a
healthy
equilibrium
.
And
despite
reservations
about
their
own
mental
health
,
all
the
students
I
interviewed
said
they
intend
to
continue
wearing
the
watch
after
the
study
.
We
as
a
culture
still
value
our
physical
well
being
,
how
we
appear
to
be
on
the
outside
,
and
what
our
actions
show
over
our
mental
health
.
Turning
to
fitness
technology
to
fix
our
mental
well
being
and
restore
a
natural
sense
of
self
is
the
very
problem
.
It’s
not
an
uncommon
experience
to
hear
Duke
students
who
are
politically
right
of
center
to
claim
that
they’re
marginalized
on
campus
and
nbsp
;
that
they
face
discrimination
nbsp
;
for
their
set
of
beliefs
.
This
perception
,
you
will
notice
,
often
manifests
as
excuses
for
students
to
hide
their
viewpoints
in
academic
or
social
settings
.
It
is
my
view
that
,
more
often
than
not
,
these
fears
are
mired
in
tales
of
hyperbole
and
unrealistic
expectations
.
This
isn’t
to
say
that
Duke
is
,
but
rather
to
encourage
intellectual
minorities
to
feel
less
apprehensive
about
expressing
their
views
.
Of
course
,
Duke
is
overwhelmingly
left
wing
,
both
in
terms
of
student
and
faculty
,
but
this
is
not
uncommon
at
an
elite
institution
.
What
is
important
is
that
,
relative
to
those
other
schools
,
Duke
does
a
pretty
decent
job
at
permitting
and
encouraging
heterodox
opinions
,
across
the
board
.
Anecdotally
speaking
,
I’ve
never
once
hid
my
commitment
to
free
markets
in
any
of
my
classes
,
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
convince
me
that
I
have
been
a
victim
of
discrimination
for
holding
these
views
.
Often
,
professors
have
been
more
than
happy
to
entertain
my
perspectives
and
those
of
my
right
leaning
friends
and
challenge
me
to
defend
them
to
the
best
of
my
abilities
.
Furthermore
,
Duke
does
an
above
average
job
in
preserving
those
conditions
necessary
to
maintain
free
and
civil
discourse
among
young
intellectuals
looking
to
engage
in
political
debate
.
The
Foundation
for
Individual
Rights
in
Education
FIRE
,
which
provides
a
rating
for
schools
based
on
their
free
speech
policies
,
gave
Duke
a
green
light’
for
its
speech
code
,
which
is
the
highest
possible
rating
that
a
school
can
get
,
which
means
that
FIRE
couldn’t
find
any
serious
threats
to
students’
free
speech
rights
in
the
policies
on
that
campus
.
Other
campuses
are
much
less
fortunate
FIRE
claims
that
fewer
than
30
universities
out
of
around
450
have
earned
a
green
light
.
I
am
more
than
willing
to
concede
that
there
is
not
nearly
enough
intellectual
diversity’
at
Duke
as
I
would
ideally
like
to
see
,
but
that
isn’t
so
much
a
problem
with
a
ready
solution
as
it
is
a
result
of
those
students
that
decide
to
apply
to
schools
like
Duke
.
The
real
issue
is
,
however
,
that
conservative
and
libertarian
students
are
simply
too
afraid
to
voice
their
opinions
,
either
because
they
cannot
defend
their
views
,
or
out
of
fear
of
some
abstract
social
consequences
.
If
you
are
in
the
former
camp
,
perhaps
you
shouldn’t
be
a
conservative
or
libertarian
.
I
would
ask
such
students
to
really
think
about
why
they
believe
what
they
believe
,
and
hopefully
consult
the
rich
tradition
of
thinkers
produced
by
the
political
right
,
so
they
may
be
able
to
formulate
a
more
consistent
politics
founded
in
reason
,
rather
than
fly
by
night
beliefs
they
picked
up
from
that
edgy
kid
they
sat
next
to
in
AP
Government
.
If
you
are
in
the
latter
group
,
I
would
urge
you
to
reconsider
your
stance
most
students
are
far
more
tolerant
of
dissenting
views
than
you
might
think
.
I’ve
had
some
of
my
most
memorable
conversations
on
campus
with
students
with
profound
opposition
to
my
views
on
a
host
of
issues
,
political
and
otherwise
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
your
friends
are
genuinely
willing
to
spite
you
for
your
lack
of
intellectual
conformism
,
you
might
want
to
consider
expanding
your
friend
circle
.
A
significant
part
of
the
college
experience
is
having
your
ideas
challenged
and
developing
them
in
an
environment
dedicated
to
learning
.
Instead
of
feeling
like
ideological
outcasts
,
conservatives
and
libertarians
should
rejoice
at
the
opportunity
to
whet
their
views
and
participate
in
regular
and
meaningful
contests
of
ideas
,
to
a
degree
that
many
of
their
left
leaning
peers
will
not
.
The
fact
that
some
students
don’t
experience
this
facet
of
university
life
is
more
than
tragic
,
and
I
do
hope
that
right
of
center
students
can
learn
to
discard
their
fears
,
and
hopefully
stimulate
more
intellectual
discourse
as
election
season
rears
its
head
.
While
working
in
the
field
of
eviction
diversion
,
I
saw
family
after
family
struggling
to
make
rent
in
overpriced
apartments
.
Many
of
these
folks
had
grown
up
in
Durham
and
watched
it
change
into
a
different
city
,
one
in
which
increased
development
and
a
new
trendy
sheen
had
sky
rocketed
the
cost
of
living
.
Now
,
as
noted
in
a
2019
report
published
by
the
National
Low
Income
Housing
Coalition
,
a
person
in
Durham
must
work
2
.
8
full
time
minimum
wage
jobs
in
order
to
afford
fair
market
rent
for
a
two
bedroom
apartment
.
If
a
person
can
no
longer
meet
this
financial
hurdle
and
is
evicted
,
the
eviction
becomes
a
permanent
mark
on
their
rental
background
and
credit
history
.
In
a
city
like
Durham
,
where
the
demand
for
housing
is
always
rising
,
it
often
means
that
finding
another
place
to
live
in
the
Bull
City
will
be
impossible
.
Being
able
to
help
prevent
or
divert
the
eviction
of
others
in
Durham
by
recourse
to
the
law
was
moving
.
However
,
it
also
often
felt
like
a
futile
effort
.
For
every
individual
we
could
assist
,
there
were
many
more
whom
we
could
not
.
The
supply
of
housing
was
simply
too
small
and
the
demand
simply
too
large
.
Until
that
fact
changes
,
landlords
will
have
no
incentive
to
be
flexible
or
understanding
with
tenants
,
and
tenants
will
have
no
ability
to
stay
in
Durham
when
they
fall
on
hard
times
.
Fortunately
,
a
recent
city
proposal
offers
a
first
step
in
the
process
of
disrupting
this
dangerous
dynamic
.
The
Affordable
Housing
Bond
is
a
funding
proposal
based
on
a
five
year
affordable
housing
plan
developed
by
City
staff
alongside
the
community
.
The
bond
promises
to
affordably
house
more
than
15
,
000
low
income
Durham
residents
.
It
will
create
more
than
1
,
800
new
affordable
rental
units
and
preserve
more
than
800
affordable
rental
units
,
most
of
them
in
downtown
Durham
.
In
addition
,
the
bond
will
also
move
at
least
1
,
700
homeless
households
into
permanent
housing
;
create
at
least
400
home
ownership
opportunities
for
low
income
families
;
and
stabilize
more
than
2
,
500
low
income
renters
in
their
homes
through
eviction
diversion
,
emergency
rental
assistance
,
property
tax
assistance
and
repairs
.
The
entire
plan
costs
about
160
million
,
and
the
95
million
bond
up
for
referendum
in
this
election
is
needed
alongside
current
local
and
federal
resources
to
make
the
plan
a
reality
.
That
95
million
will
come
from
an
additional
1
.
6
percent
tax
on
property
values
which
translates
to
an
increase
of
37
per
year
for
the
average
Durham
property
owner
.
A
recent
study
performed
by
Duke
students
in
Duke’s
Data
summer
research
program
found
that
people
of
color
and
other
historically
disadvantaged
groups
are
disproportionately
affected
by
eviction
in
Duram
,
and
passing
the
bond
will
help
keep
our
city
diverse
and
equitable
.
However
,
if
those
reasons
aren’t
convincing
,
it’s
worth
noting
that
all
Duke
students
would
directly
benefit
from
affordable
housing
being
widely
available
.
Even
though
Duke
undergraduates
are
required
to
live
on
campus
for
three
years
and
many
are
able
to
stay
for
a
fourth
,
others
will
need
to
look
to
the
community
for
housing
.
In
addition
,
there
is
no
on
campus
housing
for
graduate
or
professional
students
we
have
to
find
a
place
to
stay
in
or
near
Durham
.
Even
if
Duke
students
aren’t
actually
living
in
the
places
the
bond
will
create
or
renovate
,
increasing
the
supply
of
housing
will
help
temper
the
demand
for
apartments
and
go
a
long
way
to
keeping
citywide
rents
down
.
That’s
something
we
can
all
get
behind
.
And
,
let’s
not
beat
around
the
bush
the
bond
is
being
funded
through
a
property
tax
.
There
aren’t
exactly
many
undergraduate
students
with
houses
.
I’d
like
to
end
with
one
final
thought
.
Folks
our
age
are
often
unenthusiastic
or
unwilling
when
it
comes
to
voting
.
They
feel
disenfranchised
and
disillusioned
,
worried
their
voices
can’t
change
anything
.
But
this
just
isn’t
the
case
when
it
comes
to
the
bond
measure
.
In
local
politics
,
where
the
voting
population
is
low
and
turnout
even
lower
,
every
single
vote
matters
.
If
one
person
reads
this
and
decides
to
vote
for
the
bond
,
it
will
make
a
difference
.
If
ten
people
go
out
and
vote
,
it
could
quite
literally
be
the
reason
the
bond
passes
.
Please
consider
voting
for
the
Affordable
Housing
Bond
this
November
5
in
the
Durham
Municipal
Elections
.

My
first
year
at
Duke
was
a
tough
one
spent
navigating
D1
athletics
,
Chem
101
,
new
friendships
,
illness
,
injury
,
the
total
first
year
experience
.
Everything
was
changing
so
fast
and
every
day
seemed
to
bring
a
new
obstacle
,
yet
I
knew
I
had
one
constant
at
Duke
I
would
be
greeted
with
love
by
Julia
at
Marketplace
breakfast
.
Before
she
had
even
met
me
,
she
greeted
me
each
morning
,
along
with
every
other
student
who
streamed
into
the
dining
hall
with
a
Hey
baby
!
How
you
doin’
?
No
matter
how
many
hundreds
of
students
she
had
greeted
,
how
early
or
late
it
was
,
or
how
students
responded
,
she
greeted
each
one
with
bountiful
kindness
and
energy
.
Over
time
,
our
brief
interactions
became
long
conversations
and
these
long
conversations
formed
a
strong
friendship
.
In
my
years
at
Duke
,
has
been
a
constant
source
of
unconditional
love
,
endless
wisdom
,
laughter
,
support
through
highs
and
lows
,
and
wonderful
conversation
over
meals
.
What
was
first
one
friendship
unfolded
into
many
more
,
as
Julia
introduced
me
to
her
co
workers
.
I’m
lucky
enough
to
have
a
community
there
,
what
I
consider
a
family
away
from
home
.
Because
of
their
friendship
,
Marketplace
has
gone
from
simply
a
dining
hall
into
a
space
of
endless
love
.
While
returning
the
staff’s
kindness
should
be
a
baseline
expectation
,
it
goes
an
incredibly
long
way
.
In
fact
,
Julia
told
me
that
Interacting
with
the
students
and
getting
to
know
the
ones
that
take
time
to
ask
how’s
your
day
?
’
is
her
favorite
part
of
the
job
.
Friendships
start
simply
and
organically
here
if
you
treat
employees
with
the
same
respect
that
you
treat
your
peers
.
While
close
staff
student
friendships
are
considered
unconventional
at
Duke
,
they
shouldn’t
be
.
As
first
years
,
you
interact
with
the
Marketplace
staff
every
day
for
a
whole
school
year
.
After
a
year
of
daily
interaction
,
how
do
you
not
form
a
relationship
to
some
extent
?
Why
is
it
rare
that
students
ask
about
employees’
days
or
about
their
backgrounds
the
way
they
would
ask
other
students
?
This
mindset
,
seeking
friendships
with
students
but
not
staff
,
is
not
purely
over
our
differences
with
the
staff
,
as
we
as
students
share
friendships
despite
multitudes
of
differing
identities
.
Rather
,
it
demonstrates
a
value
system
in
which
we
don’t
value
the
staff
to
the
same
extent
that
we
do
fellow
students
.
Despite
an
overwhelmingly
progressive
campus
culture
,
it
is
an
elitist
and
classist
mindset
that
shapes
this
value
system
.
Staff
members
do
more
for
us
than
we
ever
realize
.
One
night
of
my
first
ever
O
Week
,
seven
friends
and
I
piled
onto
the
CCX
en
route
to
a
fraternity
party
.
Where
are
you
ladies
heading
tonight
?
said
the
bus
driver
.
Our
cluelessness
gave
us
away
as
first
years
at
first
glance
,
and
he
asked
,
You
need
any
help
?
Once
I
told
him
the
address
we
were
heading
to
,
he
told
me
what
stop
to
get
off
at
and
the
walking
directions
.
Before
we
hopped
off
the
bus
,
he
stopped
us
to
tell
us
to
be
safe
and
look
out
for
one
another
.
This
was
my
first
interaction
with
Big
Mike
,
and
I
was
awestruck
by
the
genuine
care
he
showed
for
eight
strangers
.
While
Big
Mike
is
a
bus
driver
,
he’s
become
famous
for
something
beyond
his
bus
driving
skills
although
he
can
hit
turns
in
a
double
length
C1
like
nobody’s
business
.
But
Big
Mike
has
won
hearts
for
the
infectious
love
and
kindness
he
spreads
on
campus
.
Brief
encounters
on
the
C1
and
CCX
became
long
conversations
,
and
eventually
I
was
hopping
on
the
buses
just
to
ride
back
and
forth
and
talk
to
him
.
Throughout
the
years
,
I’ve
been
lucky
enough
to
develop
a
beautiful
friendship
with
Big
Mike
and
his
wife
Pam
.
We
share
meals
together
,
regularly
check
up
on
each
other
and
support
each
other
through
hard
times
.
After
every
interaction
,
I
walk
away
with
a
new
nugget
of
wisdom
.
We
all
learn
by
interacting
among
each
other
,
Big
Mike
told
me
,
We
coexist
within
a
fishbowl
of
people
of
different
ages
,
nationalities
,
sizes
,
ethnicities
,
careers
,
economic
backgrounds
,
personalities
,
abilities
the
list
is
endless
.
We
all
bring
something
to
the
table
,
so
I
try
to
slowly
get
everyone
a
little
out
of
their
comfort
zone
without
imposing
on
them
.
It
is
exactly
this
mentality
that
is
the
foundation
of
Big
Mike
and
my
friendship
.
Despite
our
differences
in
nearly
every
demographic
sense
,
we
are
friends
to
the
extent
that
we’re
family
.
Thanks
to
this
bond
,
I
have
the
privilege
of
learning
from
his
plethora
of
stories
and
wisdom
.
Of
all
of
the
incredible
faculty
at
Duke
,
there
is
no
one
I’ve
learned
more
from
and
been
influenced
by
than
Big
Mike
in
my
time
here
.

Likewise
to
the
nature
of
close
friendships
between
staff
and
students
,
it
appears
that
this
sort
of
learning
is
rare
at
Duke
.
I
cannot
imagine
that
a
significant
amount
of
Duke
students
would
claim
that
anyone
but
a
faculty
member
has
served
as
their
greatest
influence
and
teacher
here
.
Yet
,
again
,
I
see
no
valid
reason
for
this
.
While
our
professors
may
be
distinguished
experts
in
their
respective
academic
fields
,
that
is
just
one
realm
of
learning
.
As
Big
Mike
reminds
us
,
we
learn
from
interacting
with
one
another
.
Thus
,
if
we
recognize
that
the
staff
have
complex
lives
,
stories
,
and
lessons
,
to
the
same
extent
that
our
professors
do
,
we
would
more
often
see
students
forming
relationships
with
and
learning
from
the
staff
.
If
I
hadn’t
simply
returned
the
respect
that
Julia
gave
me
,
I
would
be
missing
out
on
one
of
the
greatest
friendships
I
could’ve
made
at
Duke
.
If
I
hadn’t
simply
returned
the
respect
that
Big
Mike
gave
me
,
I
would
be
missing
out
on
the
most
important
lessons
I’ve
learned
at
Duke
.
This
in
mind
,
the
biggest
takeaway
from
Duke
career
thus
far
is
that
I
have
as
many
friends
to
be
made
in
the
staff
as
I
do
the
student
body
,
and
that
I
have
as
much
to
learn
from
the
staff
as
I
do
my
professors
.
This
Wednesday
,
former
Israeli
Foreign
Minister
Tzipi
Livni
will
be
visiting
Duke
,
hosted
by
the
Grand
American
Strategy
program
.
Prior
to
Livni’s
arrival
,
The
Chronicle
published
a
column
accusing
Livni
of
committing
war
crimes
.
These
claims
are
a
gross
misconstruction
of
the
truth
.
To
the
contrary
,
Livni
is
an
upstanding
peacemaker
and
a
model
for
all
of
us
at
Duke
.
Since
the
early
2000’s
,
Livni
has
been
the
face
of
the
Israeli
peace
movement
.
She
began
her
career
as
a
peacemaker
,
dedicated
to
bringing
peace
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians
,
in
2005
during
the
Second
Intifada
.
At
the
height
of
this
violent
period
,
Livni
joined
Israeli
politician
Ariel
Sharon
in
forming
Kadima
,
a
new
party
committed
to
creating
peace
.
To
Livni
and
Sharon
,
the
violence
stemming
from
Israeli
presence
in
Gaza
was
untenable
.
From
2001
to
2005
,
militant
groups
in
the
coastal
enclave
launched
2
,
400
rockets
at
Southern
Israeli
cities
.
Sharon
and
Livni’s
plan
for
ending
this
violence
was
bold
remove
every
trace
of
Israeli
presence
from
Gaza
in
hopes
of
earning
peace
.
This
plan
,
now
called
the
Gaza
Disengagement
,
resulted
in
the
evacuation
of
21
Israeli
settlements
,
the
relocation
of
8
,
000
Israelis
,
and
the
unilateral
Israeli
withdrawal
from
the
territory
.
As
Justice
Minister
,
Livni
coordinated
the
legal
and
legislative
components
of
this
plan
,
aiming
to
create
a
more
peaceful
and
secure
future
.
Livni
reaffirmed
her
commitment
to
peace
during
the
2007
Annapolis
Conference
,
a
peace
conference
brokered
by
the
Bush
administration
.
Livni’s
negotiations
with
the
Palestinian
Authority
led
to
a
joint
statement
in
which
the
two
parties
committed
to
a
two
state
solution
,
with
Israelis
and
Palestinians
living
side
by
side
in
peace
and
security
.
At
this
conference
,
Livni
accomplished
more
than
just
political
negotiations
with
Palestinians
.
There
,
she
even
became
friends
with
the
Palestinian
negotiating
team
.
I
would
vote
for
you
,
chief
Palestinian
negotiator
Ahmed
Qurei
told
Livni
,
according
to
the
minutes
of
one
2008
meeting
.
In
2012
,
Livni
founded
a
new
political
party
,
Hatnuah
,
focused
on
social
issues
and
the
peace
process
.
According
to
the
Israeli
Policy
Forum
,
Hatnuah
consistently
ran
with
Israeli
Palestinian
peace
as
a
mainstay
of
its
political
platform
,
unambiguously
endorsing
the
two
state
solution
.
Fulfilling
her
promise
to
push
for
peace
,
Livni
represented
Israel
in
the
2013
14
Peace
Talks
,
led
by
the
Obama
administration
.
During
these
negotiations
,
Livni
facilitated
the
release
of
78
Palestinian
prisoners
as
a
gesture
of
Israel’s
readiness
and
commitment
to
peace
.
As
Donald
Macintyre
writes
in
Tzipi
Livni
Agent
of
change
,
none
of
this
is
to
depict
Livni
as
a
Peace
Now
dove
.
It
is
critical
to
understand
,
however
,
that
Livni
has
been
in
Israeli
politics
for
decades
,
consistently
pushing
for
a
two
state
solution
.
This
is
not
something
to
be
taken
lightly
in
an
increasingly
right
wing
and
status
quo
driven
system
.
With
Livni’s
long
history
of
pushing
for
peace
,
why
does
the
October
21
column
accuse
Livni
of
war
crimes
?
It
comes
down
to
a
falsification
of
the
facts
surrounding
the
2008
Gaza
War
and
a
tactic
known
as
lawfare
.
Following
the
2005
Disengagment
from
Gaza
,
the
Palestinian
Authority
held
elections
in
the
enclave
.
In
a
political
upset
,
the
millitant
group
Hamas
beat
out
the
Fatah
party
for
control
of
the
Palestinian
Legislature
.
An
affiliate
of
the
Muslim
Brotherhood
and
designated
terrorist
organization
,
Hamas
seized
control
over
the
Gaza
Strip
in
2007
and
reinitiated
a
campaign
of
indiscriminate
rocket
fire
at
Southern
Israeli
cities
.
Though
a
cease
fire
held
for
several
months
,
fighting
broke
out
in
2008
when
Hamas
launched
88
rockets
in
the
opening
salvos
of
the
First
Gaza
War
.
In
response
to
this
cease
fire
violation
,
the
Israeli
Defense
Force
IDF
launched
Operation
Cast
Lead
,
a
military
intervention
into
Gaza
that
targeted
rocket
launch
sites
and
military
support
infrastructure
.
The
controversy
lies
in
where
Hamas
built
their
rocket
launch
sites
.
According
to
NATO’s
Strategic
Report
on
Hamas
activities
from
2008
2014
,
Hamas
carried
out
a
policy
during
the
war
of
launching
rockets
from
civilian
buildings
in
densely
populated
areas
.
These
included
schools
,
hospitals
and
mosques
.
Gazans
report
that
civilians
were
forced
to
stay
put
while
Hamas
militants
attacked
IDF
soldiers
from
their
homes
and
that
Hamas
rocket
launchers
were
located
on
top
of
residential
buildings
.
This
use
of
human
shields
presented
an
ethical
catch
22
.
Israel
could
either
allow
rocket
fire
at
its
civilians
or
risk
harming
Gazan
civilians
.
The
IDF
addressed
this
dilemma
with
policy
of
roof
knocking
.
Prior
to
striking
a
target
,
the
IDF
would
call
telephones
and
drop
leaflets
,
telling
the
occupants
to
evacuate
.
Nonetheless
,
loss
of
life
still
occurred
.
The
Laws
of
Armed
Conflict
draw
a
clear
distinction
between
incidental
civilian
casualties
and
those
that
occur
out
of
the
lust
to
kill
.
While
individual
soldiers
may
have
committed
unjustifiable
actions
and
have
been
rightfully
reprimanded
,
these
deaths
do
not
constitute
war
crimes
by
the
Israeli
government
.
There
was
no
Israeli
policy
of
wantonly
targeting
civilians
.
The
Chronicle
column
cites
the
UN
Goldstone
Report
as
evidence
for
war
crimes
.
What
it
leaves
out
,
however
,
is
the
follow
up
to
this
report
.
After
analyzing
further
evidence
,
Chief
UN
Factfinder
Richard
Goldstone
backtracked
on
his
previous
conclusions
,
writing
that
if
he
had
known
then
what
he
knows
now
,
the
Goldstone
Report
would
have
been
a
different
document
.
Goldstone
concludes
that
the
crimes
allegedly
committed
by
Hamas
were
intentional
.
Its
rockets
were
purposefully
and
indiscriminately
aimed
at
civilian
targets
.
On
the
other
hand
,
Goldstone
exonerates
the
Israeli
military
,
writing
that
civilians
were
not
intentionally
targeted
as
a
matter
of
policy
by
the
IDF
.

According
to
the
NATO
Strategic
Report
on
the
war
,
Hamas’
use
of
human
shields
constitutes
a
tactic
known
as
lawfare
using
the
legal
system
to
delegitimize
an
enemy
.
The
report
outlines
Hamas’
intentional
effort
to
use
civilian
human
shields
in
order
to
make
Israel
inadvertently
harm
civilians
,
a
fact
that
could
then
be
used
in
executing
lawfare
.
nbsp
;
Abu
Issa
,
a
Gazan
from
Tel
Awwa
recounts
how
Hamas
wanted
the
Israelis
to
fire
on
our
homes
so
they
would
be
accused
of
war
crimes
.
Hamas
made
the
conscious
decision
to
sacrifice
the
lives
of
Gazan
civilians
so
that
activists
could
point
to
alleged
war
crimes
and
slander
Israelis
like
Livni
.
These
war
crimes
did
not
occur
.
The
allegations
referenced
by
the
column
were
not
brought
by
prosecutors
at
the
International
Criminal
Court
,
or
any
prosecutor
for
that
matter
.
Rather
,
they
were
civil
compaints
issued
by
Palestinian
legal
groups
.
There
is
no
legitimacy
to
these
claims
,
which
contravene
every
shred
of
evidence
pointing
to
Livni’s
role
as
a
peacemaker
,
a
woman
who
has
spent
her
career
attempting
to
bring
peace
between
Israelis
and
Palestinians
.
The
perspective
on
e
cigarette
use
presented
recently
in
the
Chronicle
is
not
held
by
all
Duke
faculty
,
nor
is
it
supported
by
many
tobacco
treatment
investigators
.
According
to
the
CDC
,
the
recent
outbreak
of
respiratory
illness
among
e
cigarette
users
has
mainly
been
linked
to
contaminated
sources
of
illicit
street
products
containing
THC
or
CBD
.
The
U
.
S
.
Surgeon
General’s
report
of
2010
and
many
other
experts
have
concluded
that
the
diseases
from
smoking
are
caused
mainly
by
combustion
products
of
cigarettes
,
not
nicotine
.
Studies
of
e
cigarette
users
have
shown
that
they
take
in
far
less
toxins
than
cigarette
smokers
.
A
study
published
in
the
prestigious
New
England
Journal
of
Medicine
showed
that
e
cigarettes
were
nearly
twice
as
effective
at
helping
smokers
quit
than
nicotine
replacement
therapy
.
Therefore
,
it
is
misguided
and
counterproductive
to
ban
vaping
because
it
is
an
important
,
less
harmful
alternative
to
combustible
cigarettes
for
addicted
smokers
who
cannot
quit
.
A
ban
on
vaping
products
may
also
drive
students
to
seek
out
illicit
products
,
increasing
rather
than
lowering
their
risk
.
Moreover
,
e
cigarette
use
is
already
prohibited
in
all
Duke
buildings
.
Education
about
risks
,
including
addiction
,
is
a
wiser
approach
than
more
extensive
bans
.
While
working
in
the
field
of
eviction
diversion
,
I
saw
family
after
family
struggling
to
make
rent
in
overpriced
apartments
.
Many
of
these
folks
had
grown
up
in
Durham
and
watched
it
change
into
a
different
city
,
one
in
which
increased
development
and
a
new
trendy
sheen
had
sky
rocketed
the
cost
of
living
.
Now
,
as
noted
in
a
2019
report
published
by
the
National
Low
Income
Housing
Coalition
,
a
person
in
Durham
must
work
2
.
8
full
time
minimum
wage
jobs
in
order
to
afford
fair
market
rent
for
a
two
bedroom
apartment
.
If
a
person
can
no
longer
meet
this
financial
hurdle
and
is
evicted
,
the
eviction
becomes
a
permanent
mark
on
their
rental
background
and
credit
history
.
In
a
city
like
Durham
,
where
the
demand
for
housing
is
always
rising
,
it
often
means
that
finding
another
place
to
live
in
the
Bull
City
will
be
impossible
.
Being
able
to
help
prevent
or
divert
the
eviction
of
others
in
Durham
by
recourse
to
the
law
was
moving
.
However
,
it
also
often
felt
like
a
futile
effort
.
For
every
individual
we
could
assist
,
there
were
many
more
whom
we
could
not
.
The
supply
of
housing
was
simply
too
small
and
the
demand
simply
too
large
.
Until
that
fact
changes
,
landlords
will
have
no
incentive
to
be
flexible
or
understanding
with
tenants
,
and
tenants
will
have
no
ability
to
stay
in
Durham
when
they
fall
on
hard
times
.
Fortunately
,
a
recent
city
proposal
offers
a
first
step
in
the
process
of
disrupting
this
dangerous
dynamic
.
The
Affordable
Housing
Bond
is
a
funding
proposal
based
on
a
five
year
affordable
housing
plan
developed
by
City
staff
alongside
the
community
.
The
bond
promises
to
affordably
house
more
than
15
,
000
low
income
Durham
residents
.
It
will
create
more
than
1
,
800
new
affordable
rental
units
and
preserve
more
than
800
affordable
rental
units
,
most
of
them
in
downtown
Durham
.
In
addition
,
the
bond
will
also
move
at
least
1
,
700
homeless
households
into
permanent
housing
;
create
at
least
400
home
ownership
opportunities
for
low
income
families
;
and
stabilize
more
than
2
,
500
low
income
renters
in
their
homes
through
eviction
diversion
,
emergency
rental
assistance
,
property
tax
assistance
and
repairs
.
The
entire
plan
costs
about
160
million
,
and
the
95
million
bond
up
for
referendum
in
this
election
is
needed
alongside
current
local
and
federal
resources
to
make
the
plan
a
reality
.
That
95
million
will
come
from
an
additional
1
.
6
percent
tax
on
property
values
which
translates
to
an
increase
of
37
per
year
for
the
average
Durham
property
owner
.
A
recent
study
performed
by
Duke
students
in
Duke’s
Data
summer
research
program
found
that
people
of
color
and
other
historically
disadvantaged
groups
are
disproportionately
affected
by
eviction
in
Duram
,
and
passing
the
bond
will
help
keep
our
city
diverse
and
equitable
.
However
,
if
those
reasons
aren’t
convincing
,
it’s
worth
noting
that
all
Duke
students
would
directly
benefit
from
affordable
housing
being
widely
available
.
Even
though
Duke
undergraduates
are
required
to
live
on
campus
for
three
years
and
many
are
able
to
stay
for
a
fourth
,
others
will
need
to
look
to
the
community
for
housing
.
In
addition
,
there
is
no
on
campus
housing
for
graduate
or
professional
students
we
have
to
find
a
place
to
stay
in
or
near
Durham
.
Even
if
Duke
students
aren’t
actually
living
in
the
places
the
bond
will
create
or
renovate
,
increasing
the
supply
of
housing
will
help
temper
the
demand
for
apartments
and
go
a
long
way
to
keeping
citywide
rents
down
.
That’s
something
we
can
all
get
behind
.
And
,
let’s
not
beat
around
the
bush
the
bond
is
being
funded
through
a
property
tax
.
There
aren’t
exactly
many
undergraduate
students
with
houses
.
I’d
like
to
end
with
one
final
thought
.
Folks
our
age
are
often
unenthusiastic
or
unwilling
when
it
comes
to
voting
.
They
feel
disenfranchised
and
disillusioned
,
worried
their
voices
can’t
change
anything
.
But
this
just
isn’t
the
case
when
it
comes
to
the
bond
measure
.
In
local
politics
,
where
the
voting
population
is
low
and
turnout
even
lower
,
every
single
vote
matters
.
If
one
person
reads
this
and
decides
to
vote
for
the
bond
,
it
will
make
a
difference
.
If
ten
people
go
out
and
vote
,
it
could
quite
literally
be
the
reason
the
bond
passes
.
Please
consider
voting
for
the
Affordable
Housing
Bond
this
November
5
in
the
Durham
Municipal
Elections
.

It
was
4
14
a
.
m
.
on
a
Friday
night
or
Saturday
morning
and
I
was
up
the
wall
with
frustration
.
My
insomnia
and
sensitivity
to
caffeine
had
gotten
the
best
of
me
and
for
two
hours
,
and
I’d
been
summoning
sleep
with
no
success
.
There
was
nothing
productive
I
could
be
doing
.
But
still
,
this
idle
time
haunted
me
it
was
cutting
into
the
time
and
energy
I
had
carefully
allotted
to
my
productive
Saturday
schedule
.
And
then
I
confronted
a
question
my
boyfriend
asked
me
a
few
weeks
earlier
.
Since
then
this
question
has
unfolded
into
a
cascade
of
equally
perturbing
ones
.
Why
do
I
feel
guilty
when
I’m
not
getting
something
done
?
Why
not
allow
days
to
unfold
naturally
?
Am
I
really
being
present
in
my
life
if
my
mind
is
always
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
checking
boxes
?
What
does
this
mindset
say
about
my
value
system
?
Sadly
,
I
know
I’m
not
alone
in
this
at
Duke
,
that
this
hyper
productive
mentality
is
actually
an
aspect
central
to
Duke’s
culture
.
Our
most
common
social
practice
is
asking
someone
to
grab
lunch
.
As
feeding
our
bodies
is
something
we
have
to
do
anyway
,
lunch
is
functionally
the
easiest
way
to
spend
time
with
each
other
without
actually
sacrificing
productive
time
.
With
the
intersection
of
prestigious
academia
and
success
oriented
people
,
it
makes
sense
that
we
as
a
University
are
absolutely
sprinting
on
the
hedonic
treadmill
.
When
we
achieve
one
goal
,
we
move
on
to
the
next
,
and
the
next
and
the
next
.
This
level
of
aspiration
and
passion
is
amazing
it’s
likely
one
of
the
reasons
we
got
into
Duke
and
it
will
likely
propagate
future
success
.
However
,
this
success
oriented
mentality
needs
limits
if
it’s
going
to
be
as
conducive
to
happiness
as
it
is
to
productivity
.
Unless
we
think
that
we
are
only
as
valuable
as
what
we
achieve
,
we
should
not
be
striving
to
be
productive
all
the
time
.
Conventional
ideas
of
productivity
do
not
leave
much
room
for
personal
reflection
,
investment
in
meaningful
relationships
,
the
celebration
of
what
we
have
done
,
self
care
,
fun
nbsp
;
or
the
simple
appreciation
of
the
fact
we
are
alive
.
This
desire
to
constantly
be
productive
strips
us
from
the
present
moment
and
places
us
into
a
series
of
boxes
to
check
.
It
doesn’t
give
us
the
time
to
celebrate
what
we
done
.
I
of
all
people
am
in
no
place
to
tell
anyone
how
to
more
present
and
less
plagued
by
toxic
productivity
,
so
I
won’t
.
The
reality
is
that
there
is
no
one
definitive
answer
,
because
we
are
individuals
who
find
meaning
in
completely
different
ways
.
I’ve
found
that
my
peace
of
mind
lies
in
daily
walks
in
the
Duke
Forest
or
Eno
State
Park
and
each
time
listening
to
a
different
album
start
to
finish
.
Despite
this
campus
wide
addiction
,
we
as
a
Duke
community
carry
with
us
a
multitude
of
ways
we
ground
ourselves
.
So
,
I’m
compiling
the
self
care
insight
from
others
to
learn
how
to
better
balance
productivity
with
actually
living
.
On
brand
with
my
stress
regimen
,
I’m
in
Vondy
at
the
moment
surrounded
by
people
hard
at
work
on
a
not
so
lazy
Sunday
,
so
I
solicited
their
advice
.
Mary
Oliver
has
a
collection
of
poems
all
based
in
nature
,
junior
Caroline
Olsen
told
me
.
I’ve
read
them
in
many
meaningful
places
and
I
continue
to
read
them
here
.
It
makes
me
take
a
step
back
and
return
to
the
place
that
the
book
creates
for
me
.
I
also
like
to
juggle
,
it
gives
me
a
sense
of
control
when
everything
else
is
out
of
control
.
Our
conversation
was
interrupted
when
we
realized
that
someone
was
doing
headstands
on
the
grass
outside
Vondy
.
This
is
the
level
of
relaxation
I
strive
to
reach
.
Every
morning
I
take
out
an
hour
for
myself
in
which
I
don’t
have
to
do
anything
before
I
start
my
day
;
it
sets
the
tone
,
said
senior
Madelyn
Winchester
.
I
also
like
to
have
a
craft
project
going
on
the
side
.
I
was
weaving
for
a
while
.
I
turned
to
Daria
Patterson
,
another
senior
,
who
told
me
she’s
not
a
good
person
to
ask
,
as
she
is
really
bad
at
stress
management
.

Sophomore
Jake
Jeffries
told
me
that
he
meticulously
schedules
his
day
,
which
seemed
pretty
counterintuitive
to
me
.
However
,
he
told
me
he
schedules
in
order
to
plan
chunks
of
his
day
in
which
he
can
let
himself
do
absolutely
nothing
.
These
chunks
include
the
entirety
of
Friday
and
Saturday
,
he
said
.
That
way
,
I
prioritize
just
enjoying
myself
on
these
days
and
plan
around
it
.
Plus
I
get
to
feel
completely
present
,
having
no
guilt
.
Turning
to
Amelia
Shunk
,
a
busy
sophomore
rower
,
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
her
ability
to
focus
on
self
care
.
I
practice
mindfulness
,
I
meditate
,
and
I
try
to
simply
let
it
go
.
Also
,
having
gotten
in
to
Duke
for
something
other
than
my
academics
reminds
me
that
I
am
so
much
more
than
my
academics
.
I
think
mindset
is
the
most
important
thing
.
After
taking
this
time
to
have
conversations
about
relaxation
,
self
care
and
being
present
,
I
found
myself
breathing
more
deeply
.
I’m
actually
feeling
less
stressed
about
my
paper
and
I
decided
against
cancelling
the
plans
that
I
made
tomorrow
in
the
spirit
of
self
care
.
I
hope
that
those
of
us
with
an
addiction
to
productivity
make
strides
to
step
back
and
simply
be
present
,
and
I
hope
that
those
who
are
already
practiced
will
keep
on
keepin’
on
.
A
more
than
insignificant
number
of
our
peers
now
at
Duke
will
go
on
to
become
bad
people
that
do
bad
things
.
People
who
,
whether
indirectly
or
by
calling
the
shots
,
will
be
responsible
for
countless
instances
of
unnecessary
suffering
.
On
its
face
,
this
seems
absurd
.
We
know
that
our
fellow
classmates
aren’t
all
sociopaths
.
So
how
do
Duke
students
,
who
were
admitted
in
part
because
of
their
outstanding
character
,
transform
to
become
so
cynical
in
their
view
of
ordinary
people
,
so
callous
in
their
pursuit
for
wealth
,
so
.
.
.
evil
?
Look
around
you
,
the
transformation
is
already
starting
.
Over
the
past
couple
of
weeks
,
the
world’s
largest
and
most
maleficent
companies
have
been
recruiting
students
nbsp
;
to
work
in
their
cherished
halls
,
take
lavish
trips
across
the
world
even
if
they
end
up
within
miles
of
Chinese
concentration
camps
and
most
importantly
earn
a
shit
ton
of
money
,
fast
.
Your
classmates
,
best
friends
,
and
the
people
you
only
wave
hello
but
don’t
speak
to
in
an
effort
to
quell
their
insecurities
or
prove
that
their
economics
degree
was
worth
something
are
hushing
their
consciences
to
sell
their
labor
and
effectively
launder
their
morality
to
corporations
who
have
no
moral
compass
.
We
know
that
more
than
a
third
of
Duke
graduates
will
go
directly
into
jobs
in
the
tech
,
finance
,
and
management
consulting
industries
.
When
you
include
the
American
healthcare
industry
built
upon
turning
illness
into
profit
,
that
number
jumps
to
more
than
half
.
These
decisions
don’t
all
stem
from
free
will
choices
.
Duke
has
intimate
relationships
with
these
companies
,
some
of
their
CEOs
sit
on
our
board
of
trustees
and
can
influence
university
policy
.
Duke
promotes
their
ability
to
recruit
on
campus
via
career
fairs
and
info
sessions
.
Like
every
other
private
research
institution
,
Duke
spends
its
money
strategically
to
hone
the
skills
necessary
to
enter
these
annals
of
power
.
From
a
business
perspective
this
makes
sense
Duke
promotes
the
schools
,
majors
and
opportunities
which
will
yield
high
earning
alumni
that
will
hopefully
donate
enough
money
to
get
a
name
on
a
building
and
keep
the
operation
afloat
and
maybe
earn
their
kids
admission
.
While
our
society’s
determinants
of
job
prospects
are
larger
than
individual
,
it
makes
my
stomach
churn
when
I
hear
the
people
I
love
the
people
I
know
have
strong
hearts
and
brilliant
minds
writing
off
selling
out
as
funny
,
only
to
never
meaningfully
come
to
terms
with
their
decision
.
Implicit
in
the
joke
is
a
recognition
that
something
isn’t
sitting
right
.
What
we
choose
to
do
with
our
short
time
on
this
planet
has
impacts
beyond
our
bank
accounts
.
If
you
choose
to
work
for
a
big
investment
bank
,
you’ll
likely
spend
your
time
crunching
numbers
for
the
companies
responsible
for
the
2008
financial
crisis
which
plunged
100
million
people
real
humans
,
not
numbers
into
poverty
,
or
figuring
out
ways
to
maximize
the
returns
from
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
in
fossil
fuel
investments
.
Joining
the
ranks
of
Duke’s
prestiged
management
consultant
alumni
network
will
likely
see
you
work
for
a
company
that
helped
the
maker
of
OxyContin
fan
the
flames
of
the
opioid
epidemic
which
kills
47
,
000
people
a
year
.
If
you
like
computers
,
you
could
find
yourself
building
the
algorithms
that
inform
autonomous
flying
killing
machines
that’s
bad
,
by
the
way
.
Entering
the
healthcare
route
isn’t
much
better
.
You’ll
probably
be
working
for
an
insurance
company
whose
material
goals
are
to
make
a
handful
of
executives
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
a
year
while
during
the
same
time
period
45
,
000
people
will
die
because
they’re
uninsured
.
I’ll
admit
that
even
in
the
worst
examples
,
not
all
employees
of
the
company
knowingly
commit
these
acts
.
But
it
is
the
case
that
workers
within
large
corporations
,
especially
those
at
entry
level
positions
don’t
control
the
direction
of
the
projects
they
work
on
,
let
alone
the
projects
they’ll
never
know
about
.
Signing
a
contract
to
sell
your
time
and
productive
capacities
to
a
company
is
a
tacit
endorsement
of
their
actions
,
especially
when
by
virtue
of
their
position
as
the
entity
paying
your
wages
your
life
is
largely
dependent
on
their
existence
and
success
as
a
company
.
The
members
of
the
mafia
who
don’t
do
the
killing
,
who
might
be
relegated
to
something
as
banal
as
accounting
,
are
still
members
of
the
mafia
.
Some
will
defend
their
decision
by
arguing
their
participation
in
this
moral
quandary
is
necessary
.
All
this
argument
accomplishes
is
obfuscating
what
is
descriptively
true
and
what
is
normatively
correct
.
Just
because
it
requires
wrongdoing
to
be
successful
,
doesn’t
mean
that
be
the
case
.
If
the
world
only
provides
opportunities
for
self
actualization
at
the
expense
of
sorrow
,
then
let’s
use
our
intellect
to
change
it
.
It
might
seem
daunting
,
knowing
that
so
many
of
the
livelihoods
presented
to
us
as
the
most
viable
have
deadly
strings
attached
.
Perception
alone
cannot
explain
this
fear
.
The
nature
of
the
world
system
that
is
and
we
should
call
it
what
it
is
global
capitalism
is
daunting
.
Wealth
within
it
is
mutually
exclusive
,
and
the
methods
by
which
it
was
collected
and
continues
to
be
protected
are
violent
.

We
are
not
,
however
,
totally
at
the
whim
of
these
systems
.
It
is
because
the
system
is
so
large
and
its
interconnections
span
the
globe
that
small
differences
in
decision
making
by
people
who
hold
immense
amounts
of
power
have
impacts
that
reverberate
to
affect
millions
of
people
.
Duke
will
teach
us
how
to
hold
immense
amounts
of
power
,
it’s
up
to
us
how
we
use
it
.
The
decision
to
legitimize
a
company’s
actions
by
signing
up
to
do
their
bidding
may
mean
the
difference
between
life
and
death
.
There
are
good
people
,
including
from
schools
like
Duke
,
doing
good
work
in
the
world
.
There
are
teachers
dedicating
their
lives
to
bettering
their
students’
lives
.
There
are
civil
rights
and
immigration
lawyers
who
spend
time
they
don’t
even
have
trying
to
defend
the
most
vulnerable
against
the
most
powerful
institutions
in
the
world
.
The
work
to
make
the
world
a
better
place
is
there
;
what’s
missing
is
the
imagination
and
resilience
to
take
it
on
.
It
is
unfortunate
that
the
best
paying
jobs
in
the
world
require
willful
ignorance
of
those
who
live
in
anguish
,
but
they
do
.
The
distinction
is
clear
we
have
the
opportunity
to
either
enrich
ourselves
and
the
few
around
us
or
we
can
fight
to
work
so
that
every
human
,
by
virtue
of
their
humanity
,
has
the
opportunity
to
live
a
happy
,
full
,
and
productive
life
.

side
are
you
on

Disgusting

This
innovative
teen
,
who
sings
the
praises
of
JUUL
party
mode
,
begs
to
differ
.
More
like
suave
,
sophisticated
,
and
.
In
all
seriousness
,
Duke
absolutely
should
ban
e
cigarettes
,
and
the
sooner
the
better
.
After
all
,
our
university
was
birthed
by
tobacco
money
.
In
1890
,
James
Buchanan
Duke
founded
The
American
Tobacco
Company
,
which
made
a
killing
both
figuratively
and
literally
.
Sauteed
shrimp
from
Big
Bowl
,
perfect
sprawling
lawns
,
and
the
gothiest
of
Gothic
architecture
?
You
have
tobacco
to
thank
.
The
second
hand
benefits
of
tobacco
have
wafted
across
campus
throughout
the
decades
,
and
Duke
should
make
amends
for
its
role
in
spreading
debilitating
illness
by
helping
prevent
the
next
public
health
crisis
e
cigarettes
.
When
Duke
Health
was
preparing
to
institute
a
smoke
free
policy
in
2007
,
there
were
complaints
from
smokers
who
fretted
about
how
they’d
get
their
nicotine
fix
.
But
establishing
facilities
conducive
to
patient
health
took
precedence
,
and
the
air
was
cleansed
.
In
other
words
,
your
JUUL
fiend
down
the
hall
is
not
the
first
to
make
the
flimsy
complaint
that
his
rights
are
being
violated
.
But
it
turns
out
that
blowin’
smoke
is
just
not
an
inalienable
right
.
nbsp
;
Beginning
on
July
1
,
2020
,
Duke’s
smoke
free
policy
will
be
expanded
from
Duke
Health
buildings
to
the
entire
campus
.
Such
policies
hurt
Philip
Morris
,
America’s
largest
tobacco
company
.
Well
guess
who
owns
Philip
Morris
.
A
company
named
Altria
.
And
guess
who
owns
35
percent
of
JUUL
.
That
same
company
named
Altria
.
If
you
think
that’s
a
coincidence
,
you
probably
also
think
it’s
a
coincidence
that
James
B
.
Duke’s
statue
,
which
stands
in
the
shadow
of
the
Duke
Chapel
,
features
him
enjoying
a
fat
cigar
.
Thankfully
,
party
mode
did
not
exist
in
his
era
,
or
his
gravitas
would
be
compromised
.
Altria
wants
to
keep
America
addicted
to
nicotine
because
that’s
how
they
make
a
profit
.
So
if
Altria
can’t
get
nicotine
into
the
bloodstream
of
Duke
students
through
Marlboro
cigarettes
,
it
is
just
as
happy
accomplishing
that
nefarious
goal
via
trojan
horse
,
namely
Juul
e
cigarettes
.
And
why
wouldn’t
we
open
the
gates
of
our
university
to
this
horse
?
JUULing
is
so
exciting
,
especially
with
flavors
that
are
,
as
they
say
,
.
Creme
Brulee
,
Fruit
Medley
,
or
Mango
choose
your
poison
.
According
to
James
Monsees
,
one
of
JUUL’s
founders
,
e
cigarettes
refresh
the
magic
and
luxury
of
the
tobacco
category
.
Sounds
great
,
except
that
it
could
not
be
further
from
the
truth
.
JUULing
is
just
a
cutting
edge
method
of
getting
nicotine
into
one’s
bloodstream
as
efficiently
and
quickly
as
possible
.
Compared
to
cigarettes
,
it
delivers
30
percent
more
nicotine
per
puff
.
The
American
Journal
of
Medicine
found
that
,
among
adults
who
do
not
smoke
cigarettes
,
those
who
use
e
cigarettes
are
four
times
more
likely
than
non
vapers
to
take
up
smoking
within
18
months
.
JUUL’s
sells
itself
as
a
way
to
reduce
smoking
,
but
in
reality
it
creates
nicotine
addicts
.
Perhaps
Duke’s
ban
on
e
cigarettes
would
be
almost
unenforceable
.
But
that
is
part
JUUL’s
marketing
strategy
.
Dress
it
up
as
a
thumb
drive
,
eliminate
the
odor
,
and
it
becomes
almost
impossible
to
detect
.

Duke
should
not
facilitate
Altria’s
attempts
to
make
e
cigarettes
as
ubiquitous
as
combustible
cigarettes
once
were
.
Given
Duke’s
legacy
,
we
should
not
help
them
turn
Tobacco
Road
into
a
four
lane
highway
.
The
recently
opened
Karsh
Alumni
Center
just
changed
its
portrayals
of
African
and
Middle
Eastern
countries
.
The
portrayals
were
perpetuating
stereotypes
of
Africa
and
the
Middle
East
,
using
images
nbsp
;
of
people
in
huts
and
riding
camels
in
the
desert
meanwhile
,
these
regions
are
home
to
some
of
the
largest
and
most
advanced
cities
in
the
world
.
For
an
institution
that
touts
diversity
as
an
ideal
,
these
portrayals
were
hypocritical
.
What
happens
when
only
one
narrative
is
told
about
a
group
,
and
what
are
the
ramifications
?
When
thinking
about
any
place
,
we
tend
to
think
of
its
branding
in
the
global
consciousness
.
America
represents
freedom
and
democracy
.
France
represents
artistic
culture
and
good
wine
.
Africa
a
whole
continent
represents
colonialism
and
poverty
.
These
ideas
have
wormed
their
way
into
our
minds
because
of
the
stories
told
about
them
.
In
our
culture
that
prizes
practicality
,
we
often
forget
that
the
creative
and
emotional
aspects
of
life
can
equally
sway
the
world
.
Stories
,
which
we
so
often
see
as
solely
entertainment
,
are
inherent
and
necessary
to
the
human
experience
.
We
don’t
diffuse
stories
about
just
national
identity
.
Why
do
we
love
the
Hero’s
Journey
?
What
is
so
appealing
about
the
call
to
adventure
,
the
rising
stakes
,
the
low
point
,
and
the
cathartic
return
to
a
new
status
quo
?
The
story
formula
mirrors
our
own
lives
.
Like
heroes
in
fiction
,
we
face
obstacles
,
adapt
to
new
situations
,
and
even
defeat
antagonists
in
our
daily
reality
.
Narrative
is
not
only
global
it
is
intensely
personal
.
There’s
a
reason
why
narrative
language
pervades
modern
culture
.
We
read
between
the
lines
,
read
someone
like
a
book
,
read
too
far
into
something
.
Personal
growth
is
character
development
.
Vacations
are
a
change
of
setting
.
In
our
digital
world
,
we
literally
project
snapshots
and
video
clips
onto
our
Facebook
and
Instagram
stories
.
Stories
give
us
a
guideline
for
what
we
need
to
do
to
lead
a
fulfilling
life
.
We
learn
from
characters’
mistakes
and
successes
.
Who
hasn’t
pretended
to
be
a
favorite
character
growing
up
?
Regardless
of
stories’
influences
on
us
,
however
,
they
are
often
relegated
to
the
realm
of
frivolous
entertainment
.
Many
people
speak
with
pride
on
not
having
to
read
books
anymore
.
They
talk
of
how
they
can’t
watch
a
TV
show
until
after
classes
are
done
.
They
avoid
theater
productions
,
finding
them
dry
and
pretentious
.
The
academic
hierarchy
also
persists
.
As
this
column
from
the
Chronicle
details
,
in
the
wake
of
the
Enlightenment
,
subjects
such
as
history
,
English
,
literature
became
associated
with
subjectivity
and
thus
unprovable
in
an
academic
world
focused
on
empirical
objectivity
.
We
value
majors
in
the
hard
sciences
for
their
job
security
and
high
salaries
,
but
also
because
we
believe
they
offer
a
more
valuable
contribution
to
the
world
.
Although
stories
often
have
the
purpose
of
escapist
entertainment
,
this
is
not
to
say
they
have
no
value
beyond
distraction
.
Everyone
has
a
story
that
they
cite
as
having
influenced
them
in
some
way
.
Just
because
our
relationship
with
narrative
is
often
in
the
abstract
,
that
relationship
still
gives
us
a
context
for
relating
to
others
.
This
brings
me
to
one
of
the
main
benefits
of
a
narrative
form
stories
encourage
empathy
.
To
immerse
ourselves
in
a
narrative
,
we
often
literally
take
the
perspective
of
another
person
,
fictive
or
not
,
and
live
an
experience
through
their
eyes
.
Everyone
has
an
experience
that
they
love
to
share
.
Understanding
and
connection
come
from
listening
.
Seeing
how
stories
encourage
empathy
can
lead
us
to
see
why
the
portrayals
in
the
Karsh
Alumni
Center
were
problematic
in
the
first
place
.
Continuing
to
push
a
single
,
inaccurate
narrative
about
the
lack
of
development
in
Africa
and
the
exotic
adventure
of
the
Middle
East
leads
to
pity
,
not
empathy
.
Instead
of
relying
on
caricature
,
narratives
should
be
an
authentic
representation
of
a
group’s
experience
,
something
which
actually
encourages
the
viewer
to
be
in
their
shoes
.
In
the
end
,
our
whole
history
and
our
individual
lives
are
just
stories
.
We
live
experiences
,
observe
plots
and
subplots
,
find
twists
in
the
storyline
.
We
want
to
recount
those
lived
experiences
to
others
,
to
leave
a
mark
and
prove
that
like
any
character
,
our
existence
mattered
in
the
world
.

In
the
first
week
of
my
Civic
Engagement
FOCUS
class
,
we
were
instructed
to
write
about
one
issue
that
distressed
us
most
about
our
,
thus
far
,
limited
perspective
on
campus
culture
.
I
finished
my
paper
in
nbsp
;
fifteen
minutes
there
was
not
one
single
issue
I
,
as
a
female
identifying
student
,
was
more
aware
of
than
of
a
certain
culture
consent
.
It’s
as
subtle
as
a
waist
grab
at
Shooters
,
a
sudden
hand
on
the
back
at
Devine’s
,
an
unwanted
and
unspoken
invitation
to
dance
,
marked
by
the
drunken
presence
of
a
boy
standing
a
bit
too
close
.
It’s
as
overt
and
violent
as
the
48
percent
of
undergraduate
women
and
this
percentage
is
most
likely
under
representative
surveyed
in
2018
reporting
having
been
sexually
assaulted
since
their
enrollment
at
Duke
.
And
let
me
be
clear
the
48
percent
is
not
the
only
narrative
,
even
if
it
is
the
most
widely
known
.
More
than
56
percent
of
female
students
with
disabilities
and
50
percent
of
GLB
women
this
term
is
exclusionary
,
not
taking
into
account
transgender
and
gender
non
binary
individuals
reported
experiencing
gender
violence
,
and
14
percent
nbsp
;
of
men
reported
having
been
sexually
assaulted
.
The
percentage
of
men
experiencing
gender
violence
is
probably
much
higher
,
given
the
heightened
stigmatization
of
male
identifying
victims
.
The
48
percent
,
the
14
percent
,
the
56
percent
all
are
whispered
behind
closed
doors
,
defined
by
the
intrinsic
fear
of
being
alone
,
masked
by
Duke’s
high
retention
rates
and
gleaming
Student
Wellness
Center
.
The
central
narrative
of
48
percent
is
so
egregiously
high
that
it’s
easy
to
forget
that
the
number
represents
thousands
upon
thousands
of
people
who
have
fought
so
resiliently
to
stay
alive
.
The
distressing
issue
ended
up
becoming
a
project
.
nbsp
;
Two
classmates
and
I
launched
a
school
mandated
research
initiative
investigating
effective
methods
to
reduce
sexual
violence
at
Duke
.
Our
first
stop
,
logically
,
was
the
Duke
Women’s
Center
.
But
the
Duke
Women’s
Center
was
nowhere
to
be
found
.
I
ambled
across
spray
painted
white
lines
in
the
back
of
East
Campus
,
past
Wilson
,
through
Marketplace
,
unaware
,
uncomfortable
,
and
,
as
is
the
default
first
year
mentality
pretty
darn
lost
.
A
friend
finally
pointed
me
in
the
right
direction
;
as
I
stumbled
around
the
back
side
of
the
blankly
labelled
Crowell
building
,
the
inaccessibility
of
the
location
was
tangible
.
After
sifting
through
previous
Chronicle
articles
,
I
discovered
that
the
administration
relocated
the
Duke
Women’s
Center
in
2016
nbsp
;
from
a
central
area
of
West
Campus
to
the
not
so
central
area
of
East
Campus
.
In
addition
to
this
backyard
location
,
the
Women’s
Center
is
situated
in
the
same
building
as
the
Duke
Office
of
Student
Conduct
,
forcing
some
victims
to
associate
Crowell
with
both
the
safe
space
of
the
Center
and
the
dangerous
space
inhabited
by
their
perpetrators
.
This
move
shows
Duke’s
disregard
for
female
identifying
students
and
victims
of
gender
violence
.
We
are
cast
aside
,
relegated
to
second
class
status
by
our
own
administration
.
During
our
meeting
with
the
Duke
Women’s
Center
,
we
were
given
advice
to
guide
our
research
.
We’d
broadened
our
Internet
digging
to
encompass
plans
and
strategies
of
other
institutions
making
strides
to
reduce
on
campus
sexual
violence
.
Other
universities
have
stepped
up
.

the
end
of
Orientation
Week
even
though
sexual
assault
rates
spike
among
first
years
at
the
of
the
semester
.
To
assess
the
stringency
of
the
testing
requirements
,
I
did
not
complete
SAPU
Part
Two
.
I
was
sent
a
singular
follow
up
email
,
lost
in
the
Inbox
jungle
of
club
meeting
dates
and
class
assignments
and
weekly
blasts
.
The
prioritization
of
this
course
is
undoubtedly
low
.
Therefore
,
the
prioritization
of
the
humanity
of
sexual
assault
survivors
is
undoubtedly
low
.
At
Duke
,
the
burden
is
placed
on
the
Women’s
Center
and
student
led
initiatives
to
foster
dialogue
about
the
unique
barriers
faced
by
women
of
color
,
queer
issues
,
and
gender
violence
.
The
Duke
Sexual
Assault
policy
is
comprehensive
but
hard
to
navigate
,
filled
with
legal
jargon
that
may
prevent
some
students
from
reporting
.
The
general
sentiment
on
campus
is
that
the
administration
is
not
effectively
preventing
sexual
violence
and
has
little
incentive
to
do
so
as
long
as
the
school’s
reputation
remains
strong
.
nbsp
;
After
compiling
a
13
page
paper
on
strategies
of
peer
institutions
to
combat
this
college
wide
issue
,
I
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
our
administrative
methods
are
barely
scratching
the
surface
.
And
I
am
most
certainly
not
the
first
person
nor
among
the
first
hundred
people
to
attempt
to
affect
change
on
campus
.
So
where
do
we
go
from
here
?
We
,
as
students
,
start
with
our
relationships
.
We
start
with
the
way
we
are
practicing
affirmative
consent
,
even
during
messy
makeout
sessions
in
the
middle
of
a
sweaty
dance
floor
.
We
start
with
repeating
until
it
becomes
not
a
buzzword
,
but
a
value
.
We
reflect
on
our
own
standards
of
heteronormativity
and
definitions
of
femininity
and
masculinity
.
And
we
challenge
Duke
administration
to
live
up
to
its
word
when
it
claims
to
protect
our
bodies
,
our
mental
health
,
and
our
lives
.
Forty
eight
percent
is
48
percent
too
many
survivors
.
Forty
eight
percent
too
many
voices
silenced
.
Forty
eight
percent
too
many
lives
forever
changed
.
Because
48
percent
is
48
percent
too
high
.
The
first
time
I
heard
someone
admit
to
having
an
STI
was
last
spring
.
I
was
in
the
dressing
room
of
the
Ruby
Studio
Theater
,
sitting
with
the
women
of
All
of
the
Above
.
Performing
our
monologues
had
brought
us
pretty
close
but
the
candor
of
their
conversation
still
left
me
stunned
.
Yeah
,
I’ve
had
chlamydia
before
.
And
then
I
took
some
antibiotics
and
got
rid
of
it
.
It
was
no
big
deal
.
A
couple
of
other
girls
acknowledged
their
own
histories
with
STIs
or
told
stories
about
their
friends’
experiences
.
I
was
amazed
.
Not
only
were
these
women
brave
enough
to
open
up
about
such
a
heavily
stigmatized
topic
,
but
they
didn’t
dramatize
that
bravery
.
They
treated
a
conversation
about
STIs
just
like
any
other
conversation
normal
.
Our
collective
unease
about
STIs
rises
from
a
multitude
of
sources
.
Many
of
us
were
taught
about
STIs
in
middle
or
high
school
with
graphic
pictures
and
fear
inducing
language
,
an
effort
intended
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
protection
.
There’s
not
much
data
about
the
efficacy
of
these
strategies
,
given
that
many
schools
still
lack
adequate
sexual
education
.
The
point
is
,
I
don’t
remember
any
details
from
those
lectures
.
I
don’t
remember
any
statistics
about
the
prevalence
of
chlamydia
or
how
to
treat
gonorrhea
.
I
only
remember
the
pictures
and
the
classroom’s
groans
of
disgust
.
Duke
offers
many
sexual
health
resources
,
including
both
STI
education
and
testing
.
Unfortunately
,
the
apprehension
about
STIs
that
we
learned
to
feel
in
our
youth
hasn’t
dissipated
.
In
the
time
I
spent
as
a
PASH
responder
last
year
,
I
can
count
the
number
of
students
I
saw
take
advantage
of
our
resources
on
one
hand
.
The
free
monthly
STI
tests
offered
by
DuWell
or
the
HIV
tests
offered
by
Know
Your
Status
don’t
receive
much
attention
,
either
.
This
isn’t
surprising
these
things
don’t
feel
normal
to
us
.
They
unsettle
us
because
,
despite
our
desire
to
create
a
sexually
progressive
culture
,
we
still
won’t
talk
about
our
STIs
.
Now
would
be
a
good
time
to
note
that
I’ve
never
had
an
STI
.
I
know
this
because
I’ve
been
tested
within
the
past
six
months
and
haven’t
had
any
new
partners
since
then
.
I’ve
had
conversations
with
each
of
my
past
sexual
partners
about
our
statuses
,
and
it’s
never
been
the
horribly
uncomfortable
conversation
I
assumed
it
would
be
.
But
if
I
did
ever
contract
an
STI
,
I
suspect
I’d
feel
very
alone
.
That
conversation
in
the
AOTA
dressing
room
was
not
only
the
first
time
I’d
ever
heard
someone
mention
having
an
STI
,
it
was
the
only
time
.
Besides
those
women
,
I
couldn’t
name
anyone
at
Duke
who
has
or
has
had
an
STI
.
But
I
definitely
those
people
the
statistical
probability
is
far
too
high
to
suggest
otherwise
,
with
national
data
indicating
that
one
in
two
sexually
active
people
will
contract
an
STI
by
age
25
.
So
where
are
they
?
Where
are
you
,
Duke
student
reading
this
column
who
tested
positive
for
HPV
last
month
?
Where’s
the
girl
who
started
presenting
symptoms
of
gonorrhea
a
few
days
ago
or
the
boy
who
doesn’t
know
how
to
tell
his
partner
about
his
STI
status
?
I
want
to
hear
from
you
we
all
do
.
That
kind
of
nonchalant
courage
is
admirable
,
not
least
because
it
has
the
potential
to
make
a
lasting
impact
on
Duke’s
sexual
health
culture
,
as
well
as
on
our
own
perspectives
.
While
I
believe
the
Duke
community
as
a
whole
is
ready
and
willing
to
have
these
conversations
,
I
understand
that
there
are
many
people
who
fear
the
stigma
that
is
assumed
to
accompany
STIs
.
In
particular
,
women
often
shy
away
from
talking
about
their
STI
status
for
fear
of
being
labeled
a
slut
.
This
isn’t
an
unfounded
concern
the
sexist
narratives
that
dominate
popular
culture
teach
us
to
associate
STIs
with
women
who
get
around
.
But
let’s
get
something
straight
A
person’s
STI
status
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
character
,
nor
it
does
it
give
you
an
excuse
to
make
assumptions
about
their
life
.
As
my
friend
Jane
so
poignantly
put
it
,
Having
an
STI
doesn’t
make
you
a
ho
.
And
even
if
you
are
a
ho
who
gives
a
s
?
In
addition
to
reducing
shame
about
a
person’s
STI
status
,
having
these
conversations
can
keep
you
informed
in
case
you
ever
contract
an
STI
yourself
.
Did
you
know
you
can
have
chlamydia
,
gonorrhea
,
HPV
,
or
herpes
without
presenting
any
symptoms
?
Do
you
know
which
STDs
can
be
treated
with
medicine
?
Do
you
know
the
difference
between
an
STI
and
an
STD
?
Rather
than
frantically
Googling
these
questions
when
you
notice
a
symptom
or
two
,
educating
yourself
could
reduce
your
panic
and
allow
you
to
treat
an
STI
like
any
other
medical
problem
.
Having
conversations
about
your
STI
status
may
seem
uncomfortable
or
embarrassing
,
but
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
.
The
only
way
to
make
STIs
will
seem
as
normal
as
they
actually
are
is
to
talk
about
them
.
None
of
us
want
this
to
be
a
big
deal
.
So
let’s
pretend
it’s
not
.
Until
it
isn’t
.
On
the
morning
of
September
8
,
all
was
well
.
Students
shuffled
off
to
classes
,
yawning
,
rubbing
their
eyes
and
sipping
coffee
oat
milk
infused
,
naturally
.
Professors
assumed
their
lecterns
,
delivering
learned
wisdom
to
disinterested
youths
.
Most
were
on
Facebook
,
as
is
customary
.
But
for
the
usual
disruptions
the
noisy
tabling
on
the
BC
plaza
,
the
crazed
gaggle
around
dear
Nugget
,
the
occasional
spasm
of
student
activism
Duke
was
at
peace
.
Then
,
everything
changed
when
the
rankings
dropped
.
I
should’ve
ED’ed
to
Northwestern
,
a
first
year
spat
.
Has
my
time
here
been
squandered
?
a
senior
mused
.
That
transfer
application
deserves
a
once
over
,
a
sophomore
muttered
.
Duke
had
dropped
two
spots
in
the
annual
U
.
S
.
News
and
World
Report
rankings
,
from
an
acceptable
eighth
to
a
precarious
tie
for
tenth
.
Across
campus
,
students
vented
their
frustration
with
nefarious
forces
outside
their
control
.
One
friend
insisted
that
heads
are
gonna
roll
in
the
administration
,
trust
me
.
Reactions
to
the
rankings
vary
.
Predictably
,
that
variance
depends
on
school
placement
.
If
a
school
ascends
,
then
students
are
content
with
their
fat
,
happy
and
thoroughly
confirmed
priors
.
If
a
school
plummets
,
then
students
become
ranking
reactionaries
prone
to
fatalism
and
conspiracy
.
Year
after
year
,
the
pattern
stubbornly
persists
.
It’s
our
own
fault
.
We
assume
the
rankings
are
meaningful
,
but
that
assumption
should
be
challenged
.
We
rarely
question
the
value
of
more
information
.
Most
people
assume
that
more
data
about
anything
,
from
national
economic
output
to
Kombucha
consumption
per
capita
,
is
an
unalloyed
Good
Thing
.
No
doubt
,
data
,
statistics
and
figures
often
enable
us
to
better
understand
our
world
and
more
effectively
solve
the
problems
we
face
.
But
where
data
analysis
was
once
a
means
,
among
many
,
of
understanding
our
world
,
it
is
now
regarded
as
a
royal
road
to
understanding
.
Consequently
,
our
society
has
developed
a
quantification
bias
,
a
sense
that
numbers
must
hold
the
answers
.
We
acknowledge
there
are
other
considerations
,
but
if
a
solution
is
produced
by
something
other
than
data
driven
strategy
then
it
is
lacking
in
the
legitimacy
department
.
This
faith
in
data
is
unreasonable
.
The
information
we
manipulate
on
excel
sheets
,
run
through
regressions
and
report
on
at
length
is
a
human
creation
and
thus
imperfect
.
Our
data
is
defined
,
framed
,
collected
and
interpreted
according
to
our
biases
,
prejudices
and
failures
.
That
fact
is
obvious
,
but
it
bears
emphasis
regardless
.
Too
often
,
we
treat
data
abstractly
,
as
if
it
were
a
fruit
of
the
tree
of
observed
reality
plucked
by
some
means
other
than
our
own
fallible
fingers
.
We
should
all
take
a
page
from
John
J
.
Cowperthwaite’s
book
.
As
British
financial
secretary
of
Hong
Kong
during
the
1960s
,
Cowperthwaite
refused
to
compile
and
distribute
official
data
for
economic
output
responding
absolutely
not
to
all
requests
for
data
during
his
tenure
.
According
to
economic
historian
Neil
Monnery
,
Cowperthwiate
did
this
because
he
believed
that
publishing
data
would
create
a
demand
for
government
intervention
in
the
economy
,
which
he
,
as
a
free
marketeer
,
strongly
opposed
.
He
feared
that
people
would
claim
license
for
action
based
on
poorly
measured
,
highly
inaccurate
and
easily
distortable
data
.
Cowperthwaite
realized
that
the
mere
existence
of
data
has
the
second
order
effect
of
people
therefore
wanting
to
manage
it
and
influence
it
and
do
stuff
with
it
.
Cowperthwaite’s
realization
has
utility
beyond
the
domain
of
economics
.
Among
other
things
,
it
applies
to
our
relationship
with
the
U
.
S
.
News
and
World
Report
rankings
.
In
technical
terms
,
the
U
.
S
.
News
and
World
Report
rankings
suck
.
Their
rankings
are
based
on
six
metrics
,
all
of
which
are
,
according
to
researcher
George
Leef
,
either
input
measures
or
subjective
evaluations
and
the
weights
assigned
to
these
factors
are
also
entirely
subjective
.
A
particularly
nebulous
measurement
,
academic
reputation
,
accounts
for
20
of
a
school’s
ranking
and
is
formulated
by
polling
each
college’s
provosts
,
presidents
and
admission
officers
.
These
administrators
are
expected
to
rank
all
4
,
000
other
schools
in
the
report
according
to
academic
reputation
.
What
?
How
can
anyone
reasonably
expect
the
President
of
any
University
to
know
the
relative
reputations
of
more
than
4
,
000
schools
?
Does
US
News
expect
the
President
of
Boston
College
to
have
a
firm
belief
as
to
why
San
Diego
State
should
be
ranked
147
as
opposed
to
151
?
These
ridiculous
expectations
strain
credulity
.
Why
do
the
rankings
measure
input
factors
instead
of
output
factors
such
as
student
achievement
would
that
not
tell
us
more
about
the
quality
of
schooling
?
Why
is
school
selectivity
weighted
at
15
specifically
?
Should
academic
reputation
be
a
consideration
at
all
?
These
questions
,
among
many
others
,
deserve
consideration
and
should
inspire
harsh
scrutiny
.
Ok
the
rankings
are
flawed
,
so
what
?
No
statistic
is
perfect
!
Fair
enough
.
The
rankings
are
flawed
and
we
live
in
a
fallen
world
.
However
,
the
problem
with
the
rankings
goes
further
than
just
the
fact
that
they
are
themselves
flawed
they
are
also
easily
manipulated
.
Even
US
News
acknowledges
this
,
which
is
why
they
dropped
the
University
of
Oklahoma
and
Cal
Berkeley
for
submitting
false
information
.
Those
are
only
the
most
blatant
offenders
.
Plenty
of
quantitative
shenanigans
are
fair
game
,
such
as
gaming
class
sizes
to
create
the
illusion
of
selectivity
or
considering
financial
donations
during
admissions
to
incentivize
alumni
giving
.
Despite
the
fact
that
the
rankings
are
utter
drek
,
they
still
influence
our
behavior
.
As
Cowperthwaite
predicted
,
their
mere
existence
influences
where
high
schoolers
apply
and
whether
administrators
are
fired
or
given
a
raise
.
Amazingly
,
significant
decisions
are
justified
by
these
nonsense
numbers
.

The
quantification
of
academic
standing
grants
us
an
illusion
of
comprehension
and
control
.
We
u
a
ranking
of
every
school
.
But
we
cannot
.
And
,
we
probably
should
not
.

For

On
September
16
,
the
Chronicle
ran
a
front
page
article
extolling
Duke’s
progressive
work
on
improving
the
NC
healthcare
payment
system
.
The
article
raises
good
points
but
misses
the
mark
on
evaluating
the
state
of
public
and
private
healthcare
in
NC
.
We
are
in
full
agreement
that
fee
for
service
payment
models
for
healthcare
providers
were
poorly
designed
and
have
resulted
in
skyrocketing
healthcare
expenses
.
Any
number
of
solutions
could
be
an
improvement
.
The
American
health
insurance
and
healthcare
situations
are
just
that
dismal
.
Still
,
judging
a
replacement
for
fee
for
service
based
purely
on
What’s
better
?
is
falling
victim
to
the
tyranny
of
low
expectations
.
Instead
,
we
should
be
asking
What
solution
is
most
effective
?
Value
based
payment
is
neither
a
sustainable
solution
nor
a
meaningful
one
.
Insurance
carriers
and
providers
are
vague
and
inconsistent
on
what
exactly
value
based
payment
entails
.
Sometimes
these
definitions
can
even
come
at
the
patient’s
expense
.
Under
value
based
criteria
,
doctors
and
hospitals
may
be
penalized
for
readmitting
patients
or
caring
for
patients
with
unpredictable
health
conditions
.
In
theory
,
value
based
payment
is
supposed
to
ensure
that
quality
work
receives
commensurate
compensation
,
and
vice
versa
.
In
reality
,
large
insurance
carriers
and
increasingly
consolidated
hospital
systems
are
the
ones
who
set
the
guidelines
for
what
constitutes
so
called
value
based
payment
care
.
Meanwhile
,
the
debate
about
how
NC
providers
should
be
paid
is
nested
firmly
within
a
larger
conversation
that
played
out
earlier
this
year
of
which
The
Chronicle’s
article
made
no
mention
.
NC
Treasurer
Dale
Fowell
attempted
to
follow
Montana’s
successful
example
by
creating
a
reference
based
pricing
payment
model
instead
of
a
value
based
one
for
the
state
health
plan
,
which
covers
727
,
000
North
Carolinians
.
Such
a
strategy
pays
providers
based
off
a
percentage
of
Medicare
prices
,
which
were
specifically
set
.
.
.
to
compensate
providers
fairly
based
on
their
costs
of
doing
business
and
the
services
they
provide
.
Sadly
,
Fowell’s
plan
to
inject
cost
accountability
back
into
our
state’s
health
plan
failed
miserably
,
in
large
part
because
NC
hospitals
banded
together
,
decried
the
rates
as
arbitrary
,
and
refused
to
sign
onto
the
contract
.
Translation
NC
hospitals
decided
it
was
worth
holding
state
employees’
healthcare
plans
hostage
to
not
have
to
accept
180
196
of
what
Medicare
regularly
reimburses
providers
for
the
same
exact
services
.
I
interviewed
Charlotte
based
benefits
advisor
,
David
Contorno
,
to
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
value
based
payment
and
the
role
of
hospitals
in
determining
healthcare
prices
.
He
recalled
two
conversations
with
health
insurance
representatives
that
illustrate
my
points
.
The
first
occurred
at
an
industry
event
in
Phoenix
,
AZ
.
There
,
an
insurance
carrier
representative
bragged
onstage
about
how
value
based
payment
had
returned
14M
to
the
hospital
.
Contorno
raised
his
hand
and
asked
,
Why
isn’t
that
money
being
returned
to
employers
or
patients
themselves
?
Also
,
what
value
or
quality
metrics
were
used
to
determine
your
achievements
?
He
didn’t
get
an
answer
.
In
the
second
anecdote
,
Contorno
encountered
another
insurance
carrier
representative
who
told
him
her
company
was
moving
to
value
based
payment
.
She
cited
this
as
a
specific
reason
for
why
they
wouldn’t
be
supporting
reference
based
pricing
.
Insurance
companies
and
hospitals
should
never
be
the
ones
to
decide
value
,
reflected
Contorno
.
Only
doctors
and
patients
can
determine
the
quality
and
worth
of
the
treatment
.
When
I
evaluate
the
state
of
healthcare
in
NC
,
I
discount
the
marketing
language
of
Duke
Health
and
UNC
Health
Care
who
utterly
dominate
the
scene
in
our
state
.
I
discount
the
flowery
brochures
and
quotable
statistics
from
Blue
Cross
Blue
Shield
about
how
they’re
transforming
healthcare
.
If
these
enormous
organizations
were
truly
interested
in
lowering
the
healthcare
prices
that
are
bankrupting
Americans
,
they
would
be
willing
to
discard
a
nebulously
defined
term
like
value
based
in
favor
of
a
concrete
pricing
methodology
like
Medicare
based
reference
pricing
.
At
every
turn
,
however
,
we
see
that
hospitals
are
not
only
unenthusiastic
,
but
unwilling
to
do
so
.
Duke
Health
is
one
of
the
greatest
research
and
healthcare
delivery
institutions
in
the
world
.
I
am
proud
that
,
as
Durham’s
largest
employer
,
it
provides
careers
and
a
sense
of
meaning
to
30
,
000
people
who
are
pioneering
medical
breakthroughs
and
life
changing
care
.
I
am
even
more
proud
of
the
healing
work
it
has
done
for
countless
NC
families
,
some
of
whom
I
know
and
love
.
I
am
not
proud
of
Duke
Health’s
failure
to
leverage
its
influence
to
usher
in
the
most
effective
and
measured
way
to
make
healthcare
affordable
in
NC
.
It
will
need
to
do
more
to
earn
its
position
as
a
forerunner
in
changing
healthcare
.
Complaining
and
The
Chronicle’s
opinion
section
seem
to
go
hand
in
hand
these
days
.
Be
it
as
a
platform
for
cathartic
venting
or
as
an
outlet
for
virtue
signalling
to
one’s
peers
,
editorials
are
a
convenient
forum
to
demonstrate
one’s
wokeness
regarding
the
shortcomings
of
the
neoliberal
economic
order
and
the
West
Union
fish
.
One
notable
iteration
of
this
trend
was
a
recent
column
that
emphatically
declared
that
Duke
does
not
love
us
.
The
author
,
Gino
Nuzzolillo
,
takes
a
handful
of
campus
controversies
and
administrative
efforts
to
impress
donors
as
proof
that
Duke
exists
merely
to
preserve
the
interests
of
its
most
privileged
students
and
alumni
.
However
,
the
immense
resources
around
us
coupled
with
administrative
efforts
to
increase
and
improve
those
resources
through
increased
fundraising
,
make
it
clear
that
Duke
does
,
in
fact
,
care
about
us
.
Duke
is
a
non
profit
institution
;
not
a
charity
.
Yet
even
though
it
has
no
obligation
to
love
us
,
the
day
to
day
experience
at
this
school
overwhelmingly
suggests
that
it
does
.
In
the
vast
majority
of
its
decisions
,
policies
,
and
resources
e
.
g
.
its
top
ten
ranked
financial
aid
program
,
world
class
healthcare
,
dining
,
fitness
,
and
housing
facilities
,
newly
built
Wellness
Center
,
etc
.
the
Duke
administration’s
general
love
for
us
is
clear
.
But
even
if
you
presume
that
Duke
is
as
awful
and
unloving
as
Nuzzolillo
suggests
,
this
place
is
undoubtedly
better
and
more
comfortable
than
most
other
academic
institutions
,
yet
alone
the
everyday
life
of
most
Americans
.
The
luxurious
environment
,
social
construction
,
and
day
to
day
conveniences
on
this
campus
are
synthetic
creations
.
An
oasis
like
Duke
does
not
exist
in
the
proverbial
real
world
.
The
thought
of
a
fellow
columnist
writing
a
scathing
criticism
of
the
university
while
nibbling
on
a
salmon
and
kale
poke
bowl
from
West
Union
makes
us
cringe
.
We
hate
to
break
it
to
you
,
but
the
world
we
step
back
into
after
graduation
will
offer
few
improvements
.
We
do
not
deny
or
diminish
the
hardships
that
impact
many
of
our
peers
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
a
disheartening
number
of
personal
or
externally
imposed
challenges
can
make
attending
this
school
hard
.
But
to
assign
the
brunt
of
the
blame
to
administrative
priorities
or
a
neoliberal
framework
is
thoughtless
and
dishonest
.
Likewise
,
while
we
don’t
tolerate
,
much
less
condone
,
the
hurtful
words
and
actions
of
a
select
few
members
,
to
declare
that
the
administration
writ
large
doesn’t
care
about
us
is
in
an
insultingly
broad
statement
.
While
there
are
certainly
policy
and
leadership
changes
that
we
would
like
to
see
,
focusing
exclusively
on
the
university’s
shortcomings
is
to
lose
the
forest
for
the
trees
.
On
a
different
note
,
Nuzzolillo’s
complaints
perpetuate
a
concerning
and
well
documented
trend
of
shaming
nonprofit
institutions
and
organizations
that
increase
spending
on
development
i
.
e
.
soliciting
donations
.
Media
outlets
and
watchdogs
lambast
charities
who
have
large
advertising
budgets
,
much
like
students
mock
administrators
for
building
alumni
centers
or
planting
new
grass
on
the
quads
ahead
of
class
reunions
.
In
both
cases
,
the
implication
is
that
every
dollar
not
directly
spent
on
fulfilling
an
institution’s
primary
goals
indicates
greed
and
misplaced
priorities
.
However
,
the
uncomfortable
reality
is
that
most
of
Duke’s
public
resources
,
subsidized
services
,
and
substantial
year
on
year
financial
aid
grants
would
not
be
possible
without
the
generosity
of
wealthy
,
donating
alumni
.
Indeed
,
without
the
immense
financial
resources
that
such
donors
have
brought
to
bear
,
Duke’s
student
body
would
likely
be
far
more
socioeconomically
homogenous
.
Ironically
,
these
very
donors
such
as
David
Rubenstein
are
consistently
criticized
in
this
paper
by
individuals
that
are
presumably
very
much
in
favor
of
expanding
need
based
funding
and
resources
.
While
disclosures
on
university
development
spending
are
sparse
,
it’s
quite
likely
that
every
dollar
spent
wooing
wealthy
alumni
has
disproportionately
positive
effects
on
the
well
being
of
the
entire
Duke
population
.
Perhaps
the
most
viable
path
to
reducing
Duke’s
high
proportion
of
wealthy
students
,
removing
loans
from
financial
aid
packages
,
and
increasing
graduate
stipends
is
by
investing
in
resources
that
allow
us
to
aggressively
court
new
donations
.
Perhaps
the
new
grass
is
the
best
money
we’ve
spent
in
a
while
.
Moreover
,
staying
true
to
its
mission
of
developing
leaders
in
their
communities
,
it
makes
sense
that
the
university
allows
,
or
even
funnels
,
its
students
into
high
paying
,
high
powered
jobs
at
notorious
and
gilded
firms
such
as
Apple
,
Palantir
,
and
McKinsey
.
At
its
best
,
this
pipeline
allows
our
alumni
to
enact
positive
change
over
organizations
and
industries
.
At
minimum
,
this
system
produces
alumni
who
can
write
big
checks
to
the
university
,
checks
that
could
allow
many
of
the
proposals
favored
by
campus
activists
to
come
to
fruition
.
Regardless
,
an
education
and
degree
from
this
university
is
a
catalyst
for
achievement
,
career
advancement
,
and
social
mobility
for
any
student
attempting
to
move
up
the
socioeconomic
ladder
.
Rather
than
complaining
in
the
face
of
the
university
and
its
donors
,
critics
could
better
spend
their
time
working
with
these
leaders
to
help
steer
the
already
moving
ship
in
the
right
direction
.
But
perhaps
the
perception
that
Duke
does
not
love
us
is
more
a
byproduct
of
unreasonable
expectations
and
a
desire
to
enforce
a
particular
worldview
rather
than
an
honest
consideration
of
the
environment
around
us
.
Duke
objectively
does
care
.
It’s
time
to
show
some
appreciation
.
I
turned
the
pill
bottle
over
in
my
hand
and
listened
to
the
white
cylinders
clatter
against
the
orange
plastic
.
Maybe
this
medication
would
be
the
one
that
stuck
.
While
my
hopes
were
high
,
my
expectations
were
low
.
Since
my
sophomore
year
of
high
school
,
I
had
tried
Zoloft
,
Vyvanse
,
Prozac
,
Lexapro
and
Prozac
again
.
Every
drug
came
with
its
own
side
effect
or
,
if
I
was
lucky
,
several
of
them
.
The
Prozac
,
at
least
,
seemed
to
have
some
discernible
effect
on
my
overall
disposition
while
still
allowing
me
to
sleep
,
eat
,
and
interact
normally
.
So
,
my
junior
year
of
high
school
,
I
settled
on
it
.
I
convinced
myself
early
on
that
this
medication
would
make
a
substantial
difference
in
my
anxiety
.
But
despite
continuing
to
take
Prozac
for
two
more
years
,
I
never
quite
felt
the
difference
I
sought
.
Don’t
get
me
wrong
,
I’m
sure
it
was
doing
I’d
forgotten
what
those
felt
like
.
I
felt
powerful
.
I
felt
like
I
was
finally
capable
of
putting
in
the
work
I
needed
in
order
to
heal
.
I’ve
been
taking
Wellbutrine
for
about
a
year
and
a
half
now
.
Spoiler
alert
I
was
depressed
.
But
after
years
of
cycling
through
medications
,
therapists
,
and
coping
skills
,
I’ve
finally
found
my
way
to
happiness
.
My
depression
is
far
less
frequent
,
my
anxiety
is
manageable
,
and
I’ve
learned
how
to
handle
the
bad
days
while
feeling
proud
of
the
good
ones
.
My
antidepressants
brought
me
to
a
place
where
I
could
make
those
changes
.
That
day
in
Student
Health
was
my
turning
point
.
I
don’t
recommend
seeking
out
medication
at
the
first
sign
of
suffering
.
A
drug
can
only
do
so
much
.
But
if
nothing
else
seems
to
work
,
if
therapy
and
exercise
and
meditation
just
aren’t
cutting
it
on
their
own
,
medication
could
be
a
worthwhile
option
.
There’s
no
reason
to
feel
helpless
forever

The
road
to
finding
your
perfect
medication
can
be
long
and
stressful
.
But
finding
the
right
medication
for
you
can
be
life
changing
.
Not
because
that
medication
will
change
your
life
but
because
it
can
give
you
the
power
to
change
it
yourself
.
One
thing
you
won’t
find
in
a
Duke
packing
list
is
to
bring
a
good
pair
of
basketball
shoes
.
Rain
boots
,
yes
.
Shower
shoes
,
yes
.
Dress
shoes
,
of
course
.
It’s
all
there
,
primly
assorted
.
But
not
basketball
shoes
.
They’re
the
sort
of
item
,
like
extra
towels
,
or
air
freshener
,
that
are
only
brought
by
the
people
who
think
of
them
.
I
was
not
one
of
those
people
,
declaring
to
my
parents
the
only
footwear
I
needed
were
a
pair
of
running
shoes
.
Utility
over
specificity
,
I
thought
,
picking
out
a
pair
of
blue
Nike
sneakers
that
looked
like
they
needed
a
diligent
owner
.
In
the
two
months
I’ve
been
here
,
my
shoes
have
served
me
well
.
They’re
quick
to
put
on
after
I
wake
up
ten
minutes
before
class
.
They’re
useful
for
sprinting
after
rogue
C1
buses
departing
the
East
Campus
bus
stop
.
And
they’re
easy
to
take
off
after
a
long
and
arduous
day
.
But
they
aren’t
designed
for
hardwood
.
It’s
not
codified
anywhere
,
your
feet
are
yours
to
squander
,
but
just
trust
me
on
this
one
do
not
wear
running
shoes
to
a
basketball
court
if
you
are
not
prepared
to
fall
.
Crouching
in
a
low
stance
,
I
stalked
my
friend
Jerry
who
was
dribbling
the
ball
.
I
knew
I
couldn’t
give
him
space
to
shoot
,
so
I
decided
to
close
the
space
between
us
.
Jerry
must
have
expected
my
defensive
adjustment
.
He
suddenly
changed
his
pace
,
dribbling
towards
my
left
side
with
his
right
hand
.
I
pawed
at
the
basketball
,
touching
it
briefly
before
Jerry
immediately
switched
to
his
other
hand
.
By
this
point
,
my
forward
momentum
had
already
destabilized
my
legs
,
which
collapsed
under
me
like
putty
as
Jerry
transitioned
into
a
smooth
layup
.
Game
.
In
basketball
vernacular
,
when
an
overzealous
defender
falls
over
themselves
,
they
call
the
action
breaking
one’s
ankles
.
But
it’s
more
of
a
euphemism
for
the
breaking
of
one’s
soul
.
Since
then
,
every
time
I
went
to
Brodie
Gym
to
play
basketball
,
I
harbored
this
fear
.
I
did
not
want
my
ankles
to
be
broken
again
,
so
I
stayed
back
on
defense
.
I
covered
the
zone
instead
of
the
man
.
I
let
the
dribbler
blow
by
my
left
side
without
reaching
for
the
ball
.
I
gave
them
all
the
time
to
shoot
.
It’s
an
incredibly
passive
playstyle
.
It’s
also
incredibly
mundane
,
and
it
ignores
a
salient
reality
of
our
time
at
Duke
.
Whether
it
happens
in
a
gymnasium
or
not
,
eventually
,
we
will
have
our
ankles
broken
despite
playing
perfect
defense
.
We
will
contest
the
ball
and
still
get
dunked
on
.
We
will
make
every
shot
and
still
have
the
buzzer
beater
ricochet
off
the
backboard
.
We’ll
prove
we
can
do
everything
that
we
can
hustle
,
playcall
,
set
screens
,
and
rebound
and
still
be
the
last
pick
on
the
team
.
In
the
words
of
Jean
Luc
Picard
from
Star
Trek
,
It
is
possible
to
commit
no
mistakes
and
still
lose
.
That
is
not
a
weakness
.
That
is
life
.
But
who
says
we
need
to
follow
the
rules
?
Life
in
the
absence
of
mistakes
is
just
a
scoreless
basketball
game
.
Why
wear
running
shoes
if
I’m
not
going
to
take
a
risk
to
steal
the
ball
,
even
if
it
means
hydroplaning
into
hardwood
?
Why
take
a
challenging
class
just
to
play
it
safe
?
Why
come
to
Duke
University
just
for
the
degree
?
I
know
I
can
always
buy
a
pair
of
basketball
shoes
,
or
simply
not
go
to
Brodie
Gym
at
all
.
But
there
is
an
intangible
satisfaction
,
running
up
and
down
the
basketball
court
in
my
infirm
Nikes
,
of
committing
to
things
that
don’t
make
conventional
sense
.
A
few
weeks
later
,
I’m
crouching
in
front
of
Jerry
again
.
I
don’t
zone
him
this
time
,
or
hide
in
the
paint
.
He
dribbles
forward
.
We
both
know
he’s
going
left
.
I
shift
my
stance
.
Jerry
suddenly
does
the
familiar
,
dribbling
towards
me
,
the
ball
outstretched
in
his
hands
.
I
lunge
.
He
crosses
.
I
stagger
.
He
scores
.
But
I’m
not
on
the
ground
this
time
.

and
they’re

Civic
Engagement
is
defined
as
making
a
difference
in
the
civic
life
of
our
communities
.
The
first
form
of
civic
engagement
we
usually
participate
in
and
the
one
most
associated
with
college
students
is
community
service
.
Many
high
schools
and
scholarship
programs
require
some
number
of
community
service
hours
and
on
a
resume
or
job
application
,
community
service
hours
are
usually
a
good
addition
.
For
most
,
these
are
the
motivations
for
becoming
involved
in
the
community
.
Volunteering
then
becomes
subject
to
the
discussion
of
weighing
impact
vs
.
intent
.
If
one
person’s
intention
for
volunteering
in
their
community
is
to
boost
their
resume
and
another’s
is
to
improve
the
livelihood
of
those
they
are
helping
,
but
they
do
the
same
amount
and
quality
of
work
,
is
their
intention
relevant
?
In
the
short
term
,
I
would
argue
that
it
is
not
relevant
;
the
impact
of
their
contributions
is
the
same
and
no
matter
what
serves
as
a
motivator
they
are
making
a
difference
.
However
,
when
we
consider
the
broader
term
civic
engagement
and
the
many
other
ways
to
make
a
difference
in
the
civic
lives
of
those
in
our
communities
,
our
motivations
begin
to
matter
.
Volunteerism
with
the
right
motives
and
considerations
can
be
the
road
to
other
forms
of
engagement
,
like
political
activism
and
environmentalism
.
My
exploration
of
this
topic
was
prompted
by
a
quote
by
Rev
.
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
.
that
I
regularly
see
in
the
Mary
Lou
Williams
Center
for
Black
Culture
Philanthropy
is
commendable
,
but
it
must
not
cause
the
philanthropist
to
overlook
the
circumstances
of
economic
injustice
which
make
philanthropy
necessary
.
In
this
same
vein
,
volunteerism
regardless
of
our
motivations
is
essential
to
promoting
the
quality
of
life
in
our
communities
,
but
if
we
remain
content
with
the
idea
that
these
problems
will
continue
to
persist
and
that
this
is
all
we
can
do
to
help
,
we
may
never
become
more
engaged
in
our
communities
.
Certain
intentions
encourage
further
involvement
more
than
others
.
Those
motivations
rooted
in
our
desire
for
self
gain
will
most
likely
not
lead
to
any
further
commitments
to
civic
engagement
,
whereas
genuine
care
and
concern
likely
will
.
We
are
all
members
of
a
variety
of
communities
the
Duke
Community
,
the
Durham
community
,
the
Global
Community
and
so
many
more
.
The
considerations
and
appropriate
level
of
engagement
in
these
communities
are
also
various
.
Volunteerism
is
an
important
form
of
civic
engagement
and
the
argument
could
be
made
that
without
making
those
direct
contributions
,
we
cannot
truly
understand
the
issues
that
we
have
to
strive
toward
fixing
.
As
we
form
more
communities
and
seek
opportunities
to
make
a
difference
in
them
,
we
should
consider
our
motivations
.
Even
with
the
most
selfish
motives
,
we
can
impact
our
communities
positively
,
but
if
we
strive
to
establish
motivation
rooted
in
true
understanding
and
genuine
desire
for
improvement
we
can
unlock
our
potential
to
become
even
more
engaged
and
to
address
the
systems
that
underlie
the
issues
.
Point
of
view
It’s
Saturday
morning
,
and
I’m
late
.
I
walk
into
CAARE
just
as
the
Durham
For
All
rally
is
ending
.
I’m
here
because
I’m
supposed
to
be
writing
this
column
about
politics
,
but
I
got
sick
of
the
presidential
election
.
So
I
switched
to
the
local
channel
.
The
hottest
topic
in
local
politics
right
now
is
the
upcoming
Durham
city
election
on
November
5
.
That’s
in
two
weeks
.
Early
voting
has
already
started
,
which
is
why
Durham
For
All
is
hosting
a
rally
and
a
march
to
the
polls
today
.
I’m
here
to
watch
.
I’m
a
spectator
.
I’m
a
fly
.
I
know
absolutely
nothing
about
this
election
.
I’m
almost
definitely
the
least
informed
person
in
the
room
.
Some
facts
CAARE
is
the
Center
for
Accessible
Affordable
Health
,
Research
,
and
Education
.
It’s
in
downtown
Durham
,
a
single
story
house
looking
building
with
a
cavernous
,
fluorescently
lit
,
podium
equipped
room
in
the
back
for
things
like
speeches
and
rallies
and
maybe
sermons
.
Durham
For
All
is
a
cross
class
,
multiracial
organizing
group
trying
to
shift
local
government
to
represent
and
support
Durham’s
marginalized
population
low
income
,
black
,
brown
,
queer
.
I
don’t
really
know
what
that
means
,
so
the
first
volunteer
I
meet
explains
to
me
that
she’s
a
door
knocker
.
She
goes
around
underprivileged
neighborhoods
in
Durham
teaching
people
about
important
upcoming
policies
and
elections
.
I
feel
like
I
could
use
a
door
knocker
myself
,
but
I
don’t
tell
her
this
.
I
know
nothing
about
Durham
politics
because
I’ve
never
felt
a
need
to
.
I
live
in
Durham
,
technically
,
but
I’m
in
Duke
Durham
,
which
feels
immune
to
and
sterilized
of
anything
Durham
Durham
.
I’ve
lived
on
campus
for
three
years
without
giving
Durham
a
second
thought
.
When
I
bring
this
up
,
Ashlyn
Trinity
18
,
a
recent
Duke
grad
I
meet
at
the
march
tries
to
make
me
feel
less
guilty
.
She
says
that
Duke
encourages
the
division
between
itself
and
the
community
.
I
feel
like
she
gives
me
more
grace
than
I
deserve
.
I
expect
tension
.
I
know
there
are
many
students
like
me
who
only
venture
off
campus
for
leisure
,
to
eat
and
drink
and
dance
.
The
Durham
we
know
is
only
in
relation
to
the
other
ness
of
being
outside
of
Duke
.
I
feel
like
a
glitch
in
the
simulation
,
venturing
off
campus
,
meeting
people
I
rarely
cross
paths
with
at
school
.
As
the
march
starts
,
I
turn
to
the
person
walking
behind
me
who’s
holding
a
Fight
for
15
sign
,
a
middle
school
teacher
in
Durham
.
I
ask
her
what
the
federal
and
county
minimum
wages
are
.
I
know
,
I
should
know
this
.
But
I
don't
.
It’s
7
.
25
per
hour
,
for
both
.
She
spends
the
rest
of
the
march
giving
me
a
rundown
of
local
politics
,
tells
me
who
she’s
voting
for
and
why
,
and
introduces
me
to
organizers
and
candidates
.
She’s
passionate
about
the
public
versus
charter
school
debate
.
We
arrive
Durham
County
Criminal
Justice
Resource
Center
,
where
early
voting
takes
place
.
Noon
.
The
election
is
surprisingly
simple
.
There
are
three
items
on
the
ballot
.
We’re
voting
for
mayor
,
three
seats
on
city
council
and
an
upcoming
95
million
affordable
housing
bond
which
,
if
passed
,
would
be
the
largest
affordable
housing
bond
in
state
history
.
nbsp
;
Durham
For
All
has
endorsed
the
bond
,
the
incumbent
Steve
Schewel
for
mayor
,
and
all
three
incumbents
for
city
council
Javiera
Caballero
,
Jillian
Johnson
Trinity
’03
and
Charlie
Reece
.
These
three
city
council
members
are
at
the
event
,
which
makes
sense
since
they’ve
been
running
their
campaigns
on
a
slate
.
Their
slogan
is
Bull
City
Together
.
I
end
up
talking
to
all
three
of
them
as
we
stand
outside
the
resource
center
waiting
for
everyone
to
finish
voting
.
Javiera
tells
me
she’s
proud
of
the
trio’s
track
record
of
working
together
to
pass
progressive
policies
.
Jillian’s
interesting
because
she
stayed
in
Durham
after
graduating
from
Duke
in
2003
and
represents
an
antithesis
to
the
privileged
,
politically
apathetic
Duke
student
that
I
see
in
myself
.
Charlie
is
marching
with
a
walker
because
he
hurt
his
back
.
He
tells
me
that
since
2017
,
Durham
city
council
has
had
a
working
progressive
majority
,
and
he’s
worked
with
Javiera
and
Jillian
to
raise
the
county
minimum
wage
for
city
employees
to
15
per
hour
.
Charlie
also
tells
me
that
regressive
North
Carolina
legislature
keeps
Durham
,
which
is
overwhelmingly
blue
,
from
passing
more
policies
around
anti
discriminatory
hiring
,
rent
stabilization
and
raising
the
minimum
wage
to
15
per
hour
for
everyone
.

The
trio
seems
nice
.
They
know
what
they’re
about
.
Jackie
Wagstaff
stands
next
to
the
tent
her
and
a
few
of
her
supporters
have
set
up
in
front
of
Durham
County
Criminal
Justice
.
She’s
tall
,
brooding
over
a
crowd
who
presumably
won’t
be
voting
for
her
.
Durham
for
All
has
not
endorsed
Jackie’s
run
for
city
council
,
and
from
what
I’ve
heard
,
she’s
a
polarizing
figure
in
the
community
.
The
march
dies
down
as
people
shuffle
out
of
the
polling
station
and
disband
.
Something
interesting
happens
.
I’ve
been
talking
to
Jackie
for
more
than
ten
minutes
,
and
the
middle
school
teacher
comes
to
join
the
conversation
.
I’m
asking
Jackie
about
her
stance
on
charter
schools
,
but
before
I
catch
what’s
going
on
,
the
teacher
and
Jackie
get
into
a
tense
clash
over
details
surrounding
the
Durham
public
school
board’s
decision
in
March
2018
to
hire
custodians
as
full
time
employees
.
Jackie
suggests
that
the
teacher
doesn’t
care
about
black
kids
.
The
teacher
tells
Jackie
she
knows
that
Jackie
doesn’t
like
her
.
Jackie
assures
her
that
they
have
no
beef
.
I
try
to
keep
up
.
My
thoughts
start
to
wander
.
The
truth
is
,
most
Duke
students
will
never
directly
experience
the
effects
of
Durham
public
education
funding
or
affordable
housing
.
Most
policy
decisions
made
in
Durham
are
really
meant
for
Durham
Durham
,
not
Duke
Durham
.
Only
in
select
moments
do
Durham
and
Duke
coexist
.
And
you’ll
only
notice
if
you
care
to
pay
attention
.
Example
If
the
county
minimum
wage
is
raised
to
15
hour
,
maybe
that
one
part
time
employee
at
West
Union
won’t
have
to
work
two
jobs
.
If
the
affordable
housing
bond
is
passed
,
maybe
Durham
gentrification
will
slow
down
,
and
staff
working
at
Duke
can
cut
their
commute
times
by
living
in
rent
stabilized
housing
closer
to
campus
.
If
we’re
talking
about
the
politics
of
care
,
I
think
that
we
don’t
need
to
care
about
Durham
or
the
upcoming
election
,
but
we
should
.
It’s
reciprocity
,
the
stuff
that
will
sustain
our
community
and
ensure
its
health
.
I
often
find
myself
too
caught
up
in
my
own
stuff
to
notice
the
staff
who
work
to
make
my
life
easier
.
Being
a
Duke
student
is
a
privilege
.
Shyly
waving
at
the
housekeeping
staff
who
cleans
my
halls
is
easy
acknowledgement
,
maybe
dilutes
my
guilt
for
a
second
,
but
it’s
definitely
not
enough
.
The
support
staff
that
keeps
Duke
alive
,
that
serves
us
food
and
makes
sure
our
gross
Saturday
night
bathrooms
get
cleaned
in
the
morning
deserve
as
much
care
from
the
Duke
population
as
its
students
.
If
you’re
looking
for
ways
to
care
about
Durham
in
a
meaningful
way
,
vote
in
the
upcoming
election
and
inform
yourself
of
what’s
at
stake
.
It’s
a
start
.
The
Durham
For
All
endorsed
incumbents
are
good
,
reliable
choices
.
I
tune
back
in
to
Jackie's
conversation
because
Jackie
says
something
I
can
understand
.
Everybody
sees
what
they
want
.
Given
that
Duke
boasts
a
generally
progressive
and
accepting
environment
,
there’s
an
expectation
here
that
all
queer
students
feel
safe
enough
to
come
out
.
But
when
you
possess
a
marginalized
identity
,
feelings
of
safety
rarely
come
naturally
.
Last
week
,
a
friend
I’ve
known
for
three
years
came
out
to
my
religious
group
.
It
had
been
a
while
since
I
last
heard
someone
come
out
.
I
,
too
,
had
taken
Duke’s
assumed
openness
for
granted
,
guessing
that
pretty
much
every
queer
person
on
campus
was
already
out
.
This
friend’s
vulnerable
admission
made
me
realize
just
how
wrong
I
was
.
Coming
out
was
definitely
easier
at
Duke
than
in
my
conservative
Tennessean
hometown
,
but
it
still
wasn’t
easy
.
While
I
was
excited
to
begin
a
new
chapter
of
my
life
where
I
could
finally
be
unapologetically
myself
,
I
was
also
completely
terrified
of
what
that
life
might
look
like
.
Acknowledging
my
sexuality
out
loud
remained
a
daunting
,
even
distressing
task
.
And
it
felt
like
a
task
,
too
like
I
to
dive
headfirst
into
the
LGBTQ
community
for
my
experiences
to
be
validated
.
Yet
to
my
dismay
,
the
conservative
,
Christian
,
homophobic
context
I’d
existed
within
for
eighteen
years
continued
to
permeate
my
sense
of
self
realization
.
While
I
probably
didn’t
have
much
reason
to
be
nervous
about
coming
out
at
Duke
,
I’d
spent
most
of
my
life
with
plenty
of
reason
to
be
nervous
.
And
those
anxieties
don’t
just
go
away
because
you
think
they’re
supposed
to
.
nbsp
;
The
contexts
within
which
we
learned
to
feel
ashamed
of
our
identities
aren’t
altogether
absent
at
Duke
,
either
.
Despite
Duke’s
majority
liberal
environment
,
there
are
plenty
of
groups
,
like
conservative
clubs
,
religious
life
,
or
even
ROTC
,
whose
national
affiliations
have
extensive
histories
of
homophobia
.
Greek
organizations
were
founded
on
and
continue
to
be
perpetuated
by
heteronormative
practices
.
Queer
people
of
color
,
especially
women
and
non
binary
people
,
face
particular
discrimination
in
American
society
as
well
as
underrepresentation
in
queer
spaces
,
where
white
men
dominate
and
these
challenges
don’t
disappear
once
you
hit
Chapel
Drive
.
Just
because
Duke
is
ahead
of
the
curve
in
some
areas
doesn’t
mean
everyone
here
automatically
scores
a
100
.
These
battles
aren’t
merely
waged
between
queer
identities
and
the
institutions
that
silence
them
,
however
.
For
many
queer
people
,
the
biggest
battle
is
the
one
they
fight
in
their
own
heads
.
Not
only
are
there
queer
people
here
hiding
their
identities
,
there
are
also
those
still
struggling
to
figure
out
what
those
identities
are
.
Especially
for
the
students
who
were
raised
to
repress
their
sexuality
or
who
also
experience
heterosexual
attraction
,
coming
out
can
be
a
much
longer
and
more
confusing
process
than
the
rest
of
us
might
normally
expect
.
This
process
of
self
discovery
can
feel
very
isolating
,
especially
when
it
seems
like
everyone
else
on
campus
has
it
all
figured
out
.
Spoiler
alert
we
don’t
have
it
all
figured
out
.
Hell
,
I
still
get
nervous
talking
about
my
sexuality
and
writing
about
it
even
though
I
continue
to
choose
to
make
my
story
public
.
Coming
out
does
get
easier
every
time
you
do
it
.
But
each
and
every
time
you
come
out
is
an
act
of
bravery
.
To
the
queer
students
reading
this
your
identity
isn’t
contingent
on
this
campus’s
awareness
of
it
.
You
are
just
as
valid
if
no
one
knows
how
you
identify
as
if
everyone
knows
.
Of
course
,
I
want
to
encourage
you
to
pursue
self
realization
,
and
I
believe
there
are
plenty
of
people
here
who
can
help
you
accept
yourself
exactly
as
you
are
.
I
like
to
think
I’m
one
of
them
.
But
you
don’t
owe
this
community
anything
not
a
perfectly
crafted
coming
out
story
,
nor
a
label
to
go
with
it
.
And
we
,
as
a
community
,
must
do
better
to
understand
the
diversity
of
experiences
of
queer
students
at
Duke
.
We
have
no
right
to
make
judgments
about
anyone’s
sexuality
,
nor
to
assume
we
have
the
right
to
know
how
a
person
identifies
.
I
don’t
want
to
hear
another
he’ll
come
out
eventually
or
if
she
was
going
to
experiment
,
she
would’ve
done
so
already
.
These
statements
make
it
even
harder
for
the
subject
of
your
appraisal
to
accept
their
sexuality
,
regardless
of
whether
they’re
straight
or
not
.
Your
well
intentioned
gossip
isn’t
so
innocent
when
you
put
an
individual’s
identity
at
stake
.
Coming
out
vlogs
and
one
dimensional
queer
TV
characters
have
diffused
the
idea
that
,
for
a
queer
person
,
coming
out
is
the
final
step
in
the
process
of
achieving
self
acceptance
.
This
isn’t
true
.
In
fact
,
coming
out
isn’t
a
single
step
,
but
hundreds
of
steps
you
take
throughout
your
lifetime
the
first
time
you
admit
your
sexuality
to
yourself
,
the
first
conservation
you
have
about
your
identity
,
the
first
rainbow
flag
you
own
,
the
first
crush
of
the
same
gender
that
you
tell
your
friends
about
.
Those
steps
may
vary
wildly
between
people
,
as
may
the
time
frames
in
which
they
occur
.
But
all
identities
,
and
the
experiences
that
underlie
them
,
are
valid
no
matter
how
they
compare
to
our
ideas
of
what
sexuality
is
supposed
to
look
like
.
So
whether
you’re
still
in
the
closet
or
a
loud
and
proud
queer
advocate
,
know
that
this
community
is
ready
to
accept
you
with
open
arms
.
We’re
ready
today
,
and
we’ll
be
ready
in
ten
years
.
But
if
and
when
you
do
come
out
,
don’t
do
it
for
us
.
Do
it
for
yourself
.
Of
course
you’re
a
poser
.
But
who
isn’t
?
Let
she
who
has
not
posed
cast
the
first
stone
.
To
some
extent
,
homo
sapiens
spend
a
good
percentage
of
each
day
modeling
and
mirroring
behavior
.
But
sometimes
we
pose
meaning
we
behave
in
a
certain
way
to
give
others
a
false
impression
and
it
can
be
embarrassing
to
be
called
out
for
it
.
Ask
yourself
Why
cups
.
At
the
end
of
the
day
,
it
makes
sense
to
choose
paper
straws
over
plastic
,
just
as
it
makes
sense
to
choose
oat
milk
over
any
milk
sourced
from
an
udder
,
whether
cow
,
goat
,
or
emu
.
Neither
is
perfect
,
yet
each
is
more
sustainable
than
traditional
consumer
products
.
In
the
midst
of
all
this
environmental
degradation
,
we
can’t
just
throw
our
hands
up
in
surrender
.
Some
products
are
beyond
the
pale
and
deserve
to
be
boycotted
.
There
should
be
a
ring
in
hell
reserved
exclusively
for
consumers
of
Fiji
Water
,
whose
carbon
footprint
is
surely
gigantic
given
the
fossil
fuels
required
to
transport
the
commodity
halfway
around
the
globe
.
The
branding
experts
at
Fiji
have
convinced
tens
of
thousands
of
consumers
that
their
local
water
just
can’t
compete
with
a
protected
artesian
aquifer
found
deep
underground
in
the
remote
Fiji
Islands
.
And
what
about
the
fruit
cup
from
Vondy
that
you
had
for
breakfast
?
It’s
five
pieces
of
off
season
cantaloupe
embedded
in
a
lidded
plastic
cup
,
then
sealed
in
saran
wrap
for
good
measure
.
It
may
fall
short
of
your
daily
recommended
serving
of
fresh
fruit
,
but
it
far
exceeds
your
quota
for
low
density
polyethylene
.
Next
time
just
grab
an
in
season
apple
,
and
hold
the
plastics
.
Returning
to
your
question
,
the
Unlicensed
Ethicist
cannot
deem
you
a
poser
.
Getting
to
the
bottom
of
that
could
take
years
of
analysis
.
But
using
a
milk
alternative
is
a
good
thing
,
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
letting
others
know
it
.
In
fact
,
your
public
declaration
may
even
convince
someone
else
to
switch
over
,
or
at
least
give
it
a
try
.
Mother
Earth
will
thank
you

As
a
graduate
student
and
organizer
with
the
Duke
Graduate
Students
Union
DGSU
,
when
I
heard
about
a
rule
change
proposed
by
the
National
Labor
Relations
Board
NLRB
that
would
prevent
undergraduate
and
graduate
students
from
being
considered
employees
,
I
felt
sick
.
But
the
decision
should
also
turn
the
stomachs
of
everyone
who
cares
about
workers
or
is
an
ally
to
labor
.
This
decision
,
supported
by
three
board
members
appointed
by
President
Trump
,
reverses
a
decision
made
in
2016
that
allowed
undergrad
and
grad
students
to
form
unions
and
collectively
bargain
for
better
working
conditions
and
benefits
.
It’s
a
decision
that
we
should
all
oppose
because
it
will
negatively
affect
the
labor
rights
and
working
conditions
of
students
and
other
workers
around
the
country
.
The
proposed
rule
is
currently
undergoing
a
sixty
day
review
period
,
during
which
the
NLRB
will
review
comments
received
from
the
public
.
This
decision
will
affect
graduate
students
across
the
country
.
Over
twenty
thousand
grad
students
have
organized
and
held
union
elections
since
the
2016
ruling
.
The
NLRB’s
reversal
puts
all
of
that
work
at
risk
.
Additionally
,
it
jeopardizes
contract
negotiations
between
unions
and
administrators
at
Columbia
University
and
the
University
of
Chicago
,
where
graduate
students
have
a
real
chance
of
winning
fair
contracts
that
guarantee
better
conditions
from
improved
insurance
benefits
to
increased
stipends
.
The
NLRB
argues
that
grad
students
should
not
be
considered
employees
because
our
relationship
with
the
universities
is
primarily
educational
.
This
is
nothing
more
than
creative
doublespeak
that
attempts
to
obscure
the
important
labor
we
perform
for
our
employers
.
Just
because
our
work
also
involves
educational
tasks
our
own
research
and
coursework
for
example
does
not
mean
we
don’t
work
,
and
it
doesn’t
mean
we
don’t
deserve
a
right
to
organize
for
fair
compensation
and
better
working
conditions
.
We
serve
as
TAs
in
classrooms
,
grade
papers
and
exams
,
do
important
research
in
labs
and
out
in
the
field
.
Without
this
labor
,
universities
would
not
be
able
to
function
.
This
decision
lets
the
university
profit
from
our
labor
while
denying
us
our
rights
as
workers
.
We
deserve
the
right
to
organize
for
fair
compensation
and
better
working
conditions
,
and
better
working
conditions
for
us
means
better
learning
conditions
for
Duke’s
students
.
And
make
no
mistake
.
This
is
not
a
decision
that
just
affects
graduate
students
.
This
is
part
of
the
Trump
Administration’s
efforts
to
undermine
the
rights
of
workers
around
the
country
.
There
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
workers
around
the
country
who
,
like
graduate
students
,
are
in
precarious
positions
and
unable
to
organize
for
better
working
conditions
.
These
include
healthcare
workers
,
homecare
workers
,
drivers
for
Uber
and
Lyft
and
other
workers
participating
in
the
gig
economy
.
By
determining
that
graduate
students
are
not
employees
,
the
NLRB
is
demonstrating
that
all
kinds
of
marginalized
workers
can
be
denied
critical
labor
rights
.
Duke
,
as
a
leader
in
higher
education
,
should
show
that
it
stands
against
the
Trump
administration's
attacks
on
workers’
rights
.
Duke
should
,
like
NYU
,
voluntarily
recognize
and
enter
into
negotiations
with
DGSU
.
Only
then
can
the
Duke
community
of
students
,
faculty
and
staff
have
faith
that
the
University
is
what
it
says
it
is
a
school
that
attends
not
only
to
students’
intellectual
growth
but
also
to
their
development
as
adults
committed
to
high
ethical
standards
and
full
participation
as
leaders
in
their
communities
.
nbsp
;
Since
forming
a
little
more
than
two
years
ago
,
the
DGSU
has
organized
tirelessly
for
better
conditions
for
all
graduate
students
on
campus
.
Because
of
DGSU
actions
,
we
at
Duke
have
better
maternity
and
paternity
leave
.
We
have
increased
pay
caps
for
non
departmental
earnings
.
We
don’t
have
to
pay
continuation
fees
in
our
sixth
year
.
We
have
continued
gym
access
in
our
third
through
fifth
years
,
which
the
administration
once
tried
to
revoke
.
And
,
regardless
of
what
the
administration
says
,
DGSU’s
Pay
Campaign
was
instrumental
to
changing
Duke’s
pay
structure
to
a
twelve
month
stipend
worth
at
least
31
,
000
per
year
by
the
fall
of
2022
.
While
the
Trump
Administration’s
fight
against
labor
rages
on
,
DGSU
is
fighting
for
a
Fair
Contract
for
grad
workers
at
Duke
.
Grad
students
across
all
disciplines
and
departments
deserve
a
contract
guaranteeing
fair
pay
,
good
benefits
and
protections
against
workplace
harassment
and
discrimination
.

While
the
typical
Duke
students
gloss
their
eyes
over
these
all
too
common
stickers
as
unthinkingly
and
automatically
as
they
paste
them
on
their
own
laptops
and
water
bottles
,
one
,
in
particular
,
should
give
us
pause
.
Well
behaved
women
seldom
make
history
.
Virtually
no
truly
empoweredwoman
at
Duke
,
it
seems
,
can
claim
to
boast
an
acceptable
repertoire
of
unapologetic
and
woke
feminist
stickers
without
this
one
.
And
yet
,
as
I
noticed
my
peer’s
laptop
splattered
with
the
phrase
sitting
across
from
our
Oxford
tutor
while
studying
there
this
summer
,
at
one
of
the
most
rule
laden
,
restrictive
,
tradition
bound
and
uptight
places
in
the
entire
world
,
I
couldn’t
help
but
wince
with
latent
unease
.
Was
it
irony
,
to
tacitly
endorse
disobedience
and
insurrection
while
at
a
900
plus
year
old
institution
whose
very
existence
lies
in
its
patrons’
acquiescence
to
its
strictures
and
deep
rooted
conventions
?
Or
,
was
it
,
instead
,
a
visceral
protestation
against
the
idea
that
my
well
meaning
peer
,
and
now
perhaps
the
modern
world
,
equates
being
well
behaved
with
being
sheepishly
reticent
,
lamentably
submissive
,
so
worthless
as
to
be
forgotten
,
complicit
and
culpable
in
the
ills
that
mark
our
history
as
those
who
committed
the
wrongdoing
themselves
?
As
with
so
many
of
the
conundrums
I
face
,
David
Brooks
helped
give
voice
to
my
instinctive
disquiet
with
the
message
that
to
behave
well
,
to
act
politely
and
treat
one’s
neighbors
graciously
and
respectfully
,
is
to
render
oneself
pathetic
and
ultimately
insignificant
.
While
reflecting
in
his
well
known
on
the
value
of
self
mastery
to
the
formation
of
inner
righteousness
that
George
Marshall
embodied
,
Brooks
writes
Marshall’s
polite
social
manner
matched
his
polite
inner
makeup
.
The
French
philosopher
André
Comte
Sponville
argues
that
politeness
is
the
prerequisite
for
the
great
virtues
Morality
is
like
a
politeness
of
the
soul
,
an
etiquette
of
inner
life
,
a
code
of
duties
.
’
It
is
a
series
of
practices
that
make
you
considerate
of
others
.
Far
from
arbitrary
and
antiquated
and
even
good
in
human
existence
.

With
this
in
mind
,
our
social
and
cultural
conventions
which
erect
the
strictures
of
well
mannered
conduct
,
in
this
way
,
prove
neither
atavistic
nor
haphazard
,
neither
unjust
nor
repressive
.
Rather
,
they
represent
man’s
accumulated
wisdom
on
how
to
govern
human
behavior
in
such
a
way
as
to
condition
internal
virtue
.
By
unburdening
human
interactions
from
coarseness
and
discomfort
,
standards
of
politeness
and
expectations
of
well
behaving
individuals
serve
ultimately
to
liberate
and
provide
him
or
her
with
the
space
and
luxury
for
moral
introspection
and
growth
while
operating
in
civil
society
amongst
his
or
her
fellow
man
endeavoring
to
do
the
same
.
Inherent
within
this
understanding
,
however
,
lies
a
deeper
message
which
modern
calls
towards
insurrection
against
well
behaved
women
and
men
forgo
not
only
do
traditional
expectations
for
good
manners
sculpt
,
at
the
very
least
,
a
society
within
which
we
can
more
securely
pursue
the
good
alongside
our
neighbors
,
but
undergirding
the
notion
of
manners
itself
is
the
fundamental
wisdom
of
the
equal
humanness
which
we
share
,
most
especially
in
our
interactions
with
one
another
.
To
be
equally
made
;
to
possess
inherent
and
equal
dignity
,
irrespective
of
worldly
difference
;
to
suffer
amidst
the
same
human
fallibility
and
to
rejoice
in
another’s
graciousness
towards
you
,
if
for
nothing
else
than
a
sense
of
common
human
experience
this
is
the
best
of
what
it
means
to
be
well
behaved
.
Even
as
a
woman
who
strives
albeit
imperfectly
both
to
be
well
behaved
and
to
make
history
especially
by
pushing
back
against
regrettable
behaviors
that
have
become
norms
,
I
sympathize
with
the
motivations
to
break
the
mold
,
as
it
were
,
of
well
mannered
social
convention
in
a
noble
effort
to
liberate
all
human
potential
and
dignity
.
For
Harriet
Tubman
,
in
escaping
her
slave
owner’s
legal
possession
over
her
,
was
not
well
behaved
;
American
patriots
,
in
revolting
against
the
British
crown’s
imperial
hold
over
them
,
were
not
well
behaved
;
Rosa
Parks
,
in
occupying
a
legally
whites
only
seat
on
the
bus
,
was
not
well
behaved
.
These
brave
souls
,
I
would
argue
,
were
right
to
not
be
well
behaved
.
At
the
same
time
,
however
,
today
,
to
glorify
defiance
and
vilify
well
mannered
ness
,
is
to
slice
deeper
the
already
abysmal
divisions
which
not
only
debilitate
our
society
,
but
which
fracture
even
our
own
campus
.
Where
are
manners
when
our
peers
commit
sexual
assault
at
a
nauseatingly
high
rate
at
Duke
?
Where
are
manners
when
our
peers
incite
hatred
through
public
messages
of
racism
and
anti
Semitism
?
Where
are
manners
when
our
peers
,
desperate
for
a
sense
of
community
,
feel
forced
to
endure
the
gruesome
rush
process
,
or
even
hazing
,
simply
out
of
a
desire
to
fit
in
on
an
otherwise
socially
fragmented
and
exclusive
campus
?
Where
are
manners
when
our
peers
seek
to
impeach
members
from
a
student
group
,
or
to
blacklist
them
from
others
?
On
a
campus
and
in
a
world
so
preoccupied
with
being
nasty
,
with
overturning
oppressive
power
structures
,
with
prevailing
as
the
loudest
voice
in
the
room
,
with
name
calling
and
with
exposing
societal
ills
,
even
if
that
means
storming
stages
,
perhaps
it
would
do
us
good
to
heed
the
wisdom
of
Brooks
and
Comte
Sponville
,
to
be
considerate
of
others
,
to
focus
on
cultivating
the
great
virtues
,
even
if
that
means
appearing
lackluster
or
conformist
or
meek
.
The
question
of
virtue
begs
a
further
one
should
we
be
more
concerned
with
making
history
with
acquiring
fame
or
even
notoriety
or
with
being
well
behaved
,
with
conditioning
the
inner
order
of
our
souls
with
virtue
?
I
would
like
to
think
that
the
two
prove
not
mutually
exclusive
,
but
,
between
the
two
,
I
would
choose
the
latter
.
I
hope
you
would
,
too
.
Executive
Vice
President
Tallman
Trask
III’s
reclusive
presence
on
campus
is
a
reflection
of
his
tenure
at
Duke
.
Despite
the
colorful
suit
jackets
and
prominent
placement
of
his
Porsche
,
Trask
is
seldom
seen
.
He
is
more
content
to
work
away
from
the
limelight
that
other
administrators
enjoy
.
Last
week
,
in
announcing
Trask’s
retirement
,
Duke
celebrated
the
EVP
and
Treasurer
,
while
others
remembered
his
lack
of
action
in
reining
in
the
Duke
Lacrosse
program
,
his
assault
on
and
alleged
verbal
abuse
of
Shelvia
Underwood
specifically
the
racial
slur
he
allegedly
used
against
her
and
his
direct
role
in
the
collapse
of
the
Durham
Orange
Light
Rail
project
.
While
these
incidents
will
rightly
underpin
Trask’s
legacy
,
his
less
public
actions
speak
the
loudest
.
As
EVP
and
Treasurer
,
Trask’s
serves
as
Duke’s
primary
financial
advisor
,
managing
the
University’s
budget
,
real
estate
holdings
,
campus
construction
,
etc
.
In
addition
,
he
serves
as
a
board
member
of
the
Health
System
and
the
Duke
University
Management
Company
DUMAC
,
which
is
responsible
for
the
University’s
endowment
.
More
broadly
then
,
Trask’s
job
is
to
both
maximize
Duke’s
return
on
investments
as
well
as
to
ensure
that
the
University
is
only
funding
profitable
ventures
.
In
this
role
,
Trask
has
been
lauded
for
the
renovation
of
West
Union
and
the
initiation
of
Durham’s
gentrification
.
We
often
treat
gentrification
as
a
naturally
occurring
phenomenon
,
simply
the
consequence
of
demand
for
refurbished
tobacco
warehouses
and
high
costs
of
living
elsewhere
in
the
country
.
The
reality
,
though
,
is
that
the
investments
Duke
has
made
in
Durham
,
championed
by
Trask
,
made
the
city
desirable
.
nbsp
;
The
University
helped
fund
the
construction
of
the
Durham
Performing
Arts
Center
DPAC
and
the
development
of
American
Tobacco
Campus
,
paving
the
way
for
luxury
apartment
complexes
and
tech
start
ups
at
the
expense
of
working
families
and
long
time
residents
.
Today
,
over
3
,
000
Duke
employees
work
in
over
two
million
square
feet
of
land
owned
or
leased
by
the
University
.
In
a
2006
summary
of
Duke’s
real
estate
investments
,
Trask
wrote
,
our
role
in
the
city’s
residential
and
commercial
renaissance
fuels
the
tax
base
,
attracts
businesses
and
jobs
and
contributes
to
a
safer
Durham
.
In
cities
across
the
country
,
appeals
to
increase
tax
bases
and
the
use
of
dog
whistles
,
such
as
a
desire
to
make
an
area
safer
,
seem
innocuous
and
colorblind
,
but
are
active
,
violent
choices
to
remove
and
exclude
poor
people
,
especially
those
of
color
,
while
drawing
in
a
wealthier
,
whiter
and
younger
population
to
replace
them
.
The
effects
of
Trask’s
work
are
clear
Durham
residents
have
been
priced
out
of
the
city
.
Median
rents
rose
from
798
in
2010
to
925
in
2016
.
Every
hour
in
Durham
,
at
least
one
renter
is
threatened
with
losing
their
home
.
About
1
,
000
eviction
cases
were
filed
a
month
against
tenants
between
2010
and
2017
and
it
is
no
coincidence
that
the
greatest
concentration
of
eviction
filings
in
Durham
occur
in
predominantly
non
white
neighborhoods
.
A
massive
number
of
those
workers
are
Duke
employees
,
as
Duke
is
the
largest
employer
in
Durham
,
and
while
Trask
and
those
working
under
him
reluctantly
accepted
campaigns
to
increase
worker
wages
to
15
an
hour
,
they
have
been
intentionally
deceptive
in
the
provision
of
a
livable
wage
specifically
to
non
union
labor
.
A
Duke
helmed
by
Trask
has
not
only
made
living
in
Durham
unaffordable
for
its
residents
,
but
more
specifically
has
made
it
unaffordable
for
its
own
workers
.
While
Trask
is
fully
accountable
for
these
actions
,
it
is
also
true
that
any
person
responsible
for
generating
profit
and
prestige
for
the
University
could
be
expected
to
take
part
in
the
same
exploitation
.
In
the
eyes
of
Duke
,
Tallman
Trask
III
served
as
an
outstanding
steward
of
the
University's
finances
.
While
Trask
himself
may
be
leaving
,
his
legacy
and
the
institutions
that
protected
him
remain
.
So
,
what
does
this
legacy
teach
us
?
The
primary
concern
of
the
University’s
administration
is
the
generation
of
revenue
,
largely
derived
from
investments
in
real
assets
,
namely
real
estate
,
making
it
far
too
easy
to
profit
from
the
exploitation
of
communities
.
Duke
administrators
use
the
image
of
students
doing
service
work
in
Durham
to
show
how
the
University
is
engaged
in
community
which
,
while
valuable
,
treats
symptoms
rather
than
structures
and
serves
to
obscure
the
influence
that
Duke
has
on
Durham’s
change
.
Certainly
,
the
Office
of
Durham
Affairs
and
others
have
invested
reciprocally
in
the
city
,
but
doing
so
does
not
erase
the
oft
unacknowledged
damage
done
.
As
we
consider
a
future
Duke
without
Trask
,
let’s
also
consider
whether
we
might
also
imagine
a
new
understanding
of
what
it
means
to
be
successful
,
to
be
profitable
as
a
University
.
Trask’s
retirement
is
an
opportunity
to
reflect
on
the
hidden
legacies
that
drive
this
University
,
not
the
least
of
which
include
power
and
the
pursuit
of
profit
at
the
expense
of
people
.
Let
us
not
waste
it
.
I
had
been
experiencing
extreme
left
flank
pain
for
three
days
.
The
nurse
practitioner
at
Student
Health
was
pressing
down
on
different
parts
of
my
belly
,
intensifying
the
pain
when
touching
my
left
side
.
Yeah
,
it
looks
like
it’s
gas
,
she
said
.
Are
you
sure
?
I
responded
,
certain
that
it
was
something
more
serious
.
Yep
,
just
eat
more
fruits
and
vegetables
to
help
you
go
to
the
bathroom
and
I’m
going
to
give
you
some
Gas
X
,
she
said
.
I
eat
a
lot
of
fruits
and
vegetables
and
I
feel
like
I’ve
had
gas
pains
before
.
This
feels
different
.
And
why
would
I
only
have
gas
pains
on
my
left
side
?
I
said
,
as
my
voice
rose
in
frustration
and
urgency
.
nbsp
;
Happens
,
she
responded
,
dismissively
.
I
felt
uncomfortable
further
challenging
a
medical
professional
,
so
I
walked
to
the
pharmacy
to
pick
up
the
Gas
X
,
bending
over
in
excruciating
pain
.
The
next
morning
,
I
woke
up
paralyzed
in
pain
.
The
Gas
X
did
not
work
.
I
called
Student
Health
and
explained
that
my
pain
was
now
10
times
worse
,
asking
what
I
should
do
.
The
nurse
nonchalantly
suggested
that
I
go
to
the
ER
,
if
you
feel
like
you
need
to
.
My
roommate
drove
me
to
the
ER
,
where
a
scan
showed
that
the
pain
was
caused
by
a
massive
hemorrhage
around
my
left
kidney
.
I
later
learned
that
the
bleeding
resulted
from
an
18
x
14
cm
cancerous
tumor
.
I
look
back
at
Student
Health’s
grave
misdiagnosis
with
little
complaint
that
they
got
it
wrong
.
I
found
out
soon
after
and
that’s
what
matters
.
What
troubles
me
is
how
casually
the
nurse
practitioner
wrote
off
my
concerns
.
How
she
was
so
certain
that
it
was
just
gas
pains
,
despite
my
repeated
attempts
to
push
back
and
emphasize
that
I
was
experiencing
a
10
out
of
10
on
the
pain
scale
.
Her
extreme
carelessness
led
to
something
as
laughable
as
cancer
diagnosed
as
gas
pains
.
I
would
feel
less
perturbed
if
this
were
a
one
off
event
.
But
since
stepping
foot
on
campus
,
I
have
heard
stories
of
Student
Health
misdiagnosing
students
or
somehow
making
their
lives
harder
.
I
know
individuals
who
completely
swore
off
Student
Health
,
choosing
to
go
directly
to
a
local
urgent
care
when
sick
.

Take
senior
Sam
Elliott
,
for
example
.
At
the
end
of
his
first
year
,
he
was
sicker
than
ever
fatigued
,
winded
while
walking
up
the
stairs
,
crackling
in
his
chest
while
breathing
,
and
coughing
up
thick
green
and
yellow
mucus
.
At
Student
Health
,
the
nurse
practitioner
listened
to
his
breathing
through
a
stethoscope
and
conducted
a
lung
function
test
.
She
then
diagnosed
Elliott
with
asthma
and
sent
him
on
his
way
with
an
inhaler
.
Elliott
,
a
former
Division
I
athlete
who
had
never
experienced
issues
with
breathing
,
did
not
feel
that
he
was
given
adequate
care
,
but
wasn’t
sure
how
to
communicate
that
to
his
provider
.
When
they
said
the
diagnosis
,
I
was
like
I
don't
think
so
,
’
but
at
the
same
time
I
felt
that
they
were
the
professionals
,
Elliott
said
.
I
was
a
freshman
in
college
with
zero
medical
background
and
just
trusted
doctors
and
nurses
.
But
now
I
realize
you
should
always
question
what's
going
on
.
Elliott
continued
to
feel
very
ill
,
until
returning
to
his
home
in
Kansas
a
week
and
a
half
later
.
His
mom
took
him
to
a
Minute
Clinic
,
where
the
physician
assistant
quickly
suggested
the
possibility
of
pneumonia
and
the
need
for
an
x
ray
.
The
scan
showed
that
the
physician
assistant
was
correct
.
Elliott
ultimately
needed
two
rounds
of
antibiotics
before
his
symptoms
began
to
subside
.
Elliott
said
that
the
improper
care
he
received
at
Student
Health
led
him
to
finding
light
permanent
scarring
on
his
lungs
and
feeling
ill
for
much
longer
than
he
would’ve
felt
if
given
an
accurate
initial
diagnosis
.
I've
gone
back
to
student
health
to
get
blood
work
done
or
a
referral
,
but
other
than
that
,
I
don’t
really
go
back
.
I
try
not
to
go
to
student
health
.
I
don't
trust
them
,
Elliott
said
.
Sophomore
Cate
Schick
felt
similarly
dismissed
by
Student
Health
.
Schick
was
sitting
in
the
front
row
of
the
class
when
her
professor
noticed
that
her
face
had
completely
swelled
up
and
immediately
excused
her
for
a
student
health
visit
.
She
recalled
that
one
of
her
eyes
was
almost
swollen
shut
.
In
the
five
to
ten
minute
meeting
with
Schick
,
a
doctor
asked
whether
she
was
stressed
and
if
she
had
any
midterms
coming
up
,
which
she
answered
yes
.
After
noting
that
Schick
had
previously
visited
Counseling
and
Psychological
Services
,
the
doctor
decided
that
the
swelling
was
a
physical
reaction
to
stress
,
and
suggested
that
she
returns
to
CAPS
.
The
swelling
subsided
by
the
next
morning
,
but
Schick
later
learned
that
contrary
to
what
the
doctor
said
,
she
was
experiencing
an
allergic
reaction
to
a
cosmetic
product
.
Schick
said
that
the
doctor
not
only
gave
a
misleading
diagnosis
,
but
also
was
condescending
in
his
dismissal
of
her
concerns
.
I
just
felt
like
they
were
trying
to
dismiss
me
because
they
were
busy
that
day
.
I
felt
very
not
wanted
in
the
office
,
Schick
said
.
John
Vaughn
,
director
of
Student
Health
Services
,
told
me
that
he
cannot
comment
on
any
specific
case
,
but
he
would
be
reluctant
to
use
the
term
misdiagnosis’
because
symptoms
can
evolve
over
time
.
Students
can
come
in
one
day
and
it
can
look
like
an
allergy
or
a
cold
,
and
then
within
three
days
it
can
be
full
blown
pneumonia
,
Vaughn
said
.
Richard
Chung
,
Duke
Health
adolescent
and
young
adult
medicine
specialist
,
agreed
that
initial
diagnoses
are
not
infallible
.
A
key
concern
is
a
matter
of
making
an
initial
judgement
and
then
following
up
and
communicating
afterwards
to
confirm
that
diagnosis
,
or
to
change
the
diagnosis
and
do
something
differently
,
Chung
said
.
Part
of
the
issue
may
be
there
isn't
that
clear
infrastructure
for
that
follow
up
to
happen
.
While
patients
should
follow
up
with
their
provider
if
their
symptoms
are
not
improving
,
clinicians
can
also
reach
out
to
check
on
their
patients
,
said
Chung
.
Both
Schick
and
Elliott
said
that
their
provider
did
not
suggest
for
them
to
follow
up
after
the
appointment
,
so
they
did
not
think
to
either
.
Vaughn
thinks
that
Student
Health
is
doing
an
outstanding
job
,
and
that
over
90
of
students
who
visit
student
health
have
a
good
experience
.
He
added
that
he’s
also
heard
positive
feedback
from
a
student
advisory
committee
that
analyzes
student
feedback
and
liaises
between
Student
Health
and
the
broader
campus
population
.
But
Vaughn’s
confidence
in
Student
Health
,
as
well
as
the
feedback
that
he
receives
,
struck
me
as
inconsistent
with
reality
.
The
above
experiences
are
only
a
few
of
the
countless
anecdotes
that
I
had
learned
through
interviews
and
other
conversations
.
A
culture
of
dismissing
and
neglecting
student
need
exists
in
Student
Health
.
To
start
,
Student
Health
employees
require
training
in
how
to
foster
trusting
and
communicative
relationships
with
students
,
who
should
learn
to
take
greater
control
of
their
interactions
with
clinicians
.
The
University
should
seek
to
continue
this
conversation
,
because
a
Student
Health
that
completely
lacks
the
faith
of
its
students
surely
fails
to
adequately
care
for
their
health
.
I
was
very
nearly
late
to
the
Diwali
service
at
the
Chapel
on
Friday
evening
,
victim
to
a
last
minute
clothes
change
and
the
vagaries
of
the
late
night
bus
schedule
.
I
met
my
parents
,
who
were
here
for
family
weekend
,
on
the
Chapel
Steps
and
walked
in
just
before
the
main
service
started
.
Perhaps
appropriately
for
a
holiday
falling
so
close
to
Halloween
,
the
lights
were
dimmed
inside
the
Chapel
,
giving
an
eerie
,
ghostlike
feeling
to
the
whole
ceremony
.
In
place
of
the
normal
lighting
,
little
artificial
candles
lined
the
pews
and
formed
an
om
symbol
outside
the
main
doors
.
The
service
itself
followed
a
format
quite
familiar
to
me
,
a
mixture
of
religious
ceremony
and
artistic
performances
celebrating
Indian
culture
and
heritage
.
There
were
as
we
left
.
In
many
ways
,
the
fact
that
this
service
was
happening
at
all
was
a
great
victory
for
the
Hindu
community
at
Duke
.
This
was
the
third
time
that
Duke
held
Diwali
celebrations
in
the
Chapel
.
The
fact
that
a
non
Christian
group
could
hold
an
event
in
Duke’s
most
iconic
building
is
a
great
step
in
increasing
recognition
of
the
Hindu
community
,
allowing
it
to
fully
take
its
place
in
the
quilt
of
Duke
religious
organizations
.
This
progress
is
especially
important
given
that
Hindu
students
have
no
space
comparable
to
the
Freeman
Center
for
Jewish
Life
or
the
Muslim
Life
at
Duke
building
.
As
the
Community
Editorial
Board
pointed
out
earlier
this
year
,
the
main
space
dedicated
to
Hindus
here
is
a
small
prayer
room
in
the
greenhouse
level
of
the
Bryan
Center
.
I
went
there
once
on
a
lark
.
It
took
me
several
tries
to
find
the
elevator
that
took
me
to
the
greenhouse
level
,
and
once
I
got
there
,
I
was
greeted
by
a
bare
,
windowless
room
.
Needless
to
say
,
this
is
not
exactly
the
most
prominent
location
for
a
religious
community
,
which
makes
the
significance
of
holding
the
ceremony
in
Duke’s
most
prominent
building
even
greater
.
I
did
,
nonetheless
,
sense
something
almost
cosmically
absurd
about
the
whole
ceremony
.
The
fact
that
a
religion
that
places
strong
emphasis
on
idol
worship
was
holding
a
ceremony
in
a
Christian
church
was
not
lost
on
me
.
There
was
a
definite
contrast
between
vast
the
scale
of
the
Chapel
lighting
and
the
artificial
candles
lining
the
pews
which
can
be
bought
in
sets
of
24
for
9
.
50
.
Instead
of
standing
on
the
lectern
where
the
sermon
is
normally
delivered
,
the
priestesses
and
the
speaker
stood
in
front
of
the
first
row
of
chairs
,
meaning
that
the
audience
sitting
further
back
likely
had
trouble
seeing
them
.
It
felt
almost
as
if
the
Chapel
was
too
grand
a
setting
for
a
ceremony
like
this
.
The
Diwali
ceremony
,
in
all
its
beauty
and
oddity
,
tells
us
a
lot
about
the
nature
of
religious
practice
in
small
faiths
and
of
the
experience
of
being
both
a
part
of
the
mainstream
and
just
outside
of
it
.
Growing
up
,
I
remember
going
to
Pujas
and
cultural
events
in
rented
high
school
gymnasiums
and
cafeterias
.
Here
at
Duke
,
the
last
Hindu
consisted
primarily
of
a
couple
dozen
or
so
people
sitting
criss
cross
on
the
floor
singing
Sanskrit
hymns
.
For
myself
,
and
I
suspect
for
many
others
as
well
,
Hinduism
is
something
that
is
done
as
a
guest
in
someone
else’s
space
.
The
lack
of
a
dedicated
religious
space
does
not
mean
that
Hindus
in
the
United
States
are
somehow
spiritually
deficient
.
Upstart
and
diasporic
faiths
all
over
the
world
understood
that
grand
temples
or
mosques
are
not
needed
to
foster
religious
feeling
and
community
.
When
the
Christian
faith
was
just
getting
started
,
Jesus
said
to
the
people
of
his
nascent
community
,
where
two
or
three
of
you
gather
in
my
name
,
there
I
am
with
them
Matthew
18
20
,
New
International
Version
.
A
religion
is
not
a
building
,
and
religions
can
thrive
without
permanent
spaces
of
worship
.
Nevertheless
,
I
suspect
that
the
lack
of
a
permanent
space
of
worship
apart
from
that
tiny
room
hidden
away
in
the
Bryan
Center
might
be
behind
some
of
the
contrasts
of
the
Diwali
ceremony
.
Despite
the
victory
of
being
able
to
hold
a
ceremony
in
the
Chapel
,
the
Hindus
were
still
fundamentally
guests
of
someone
else
.
There
were
probably
good
reasons
for
some
of
the
oddities
which
I
observed
.
The
artificial
candles
were
probably
used
because
they
are
safer
and
more
affordable
than
regular
candles
.
Maybe
the
lectern
was
not
used
because
they
did
not
want
to
possibly
disturb
the
altar
area
for
the
people
who
normally
used
it
.
But
all
of
these
good
reasons
still
emphasized
the
Hindus’
status
as
outsiders
,
who
could
temporarily
use
the
Chapel
for
our
purposes
before
giving
it
back
to
its
real
owners
.
In
the
end
,
the
Diwali
ceremony
was
emotionally
complex
for
me
,
revealing
both
the
beauty
of
Indian
culture
and
the
difficulty
of
true
integration
into
the
mainstream
.
Maybe
,
however
,
that
is
the
point
.
Being
part
of
a
minority
is
frequently
a
delicate
balancing
act
of
being
both
a
part
of
the
mainstream
and
not
a
part
.
Perhaps
the
Diwali
ceremony
is
a
celebration
of
this
reality
.
About
a
year
ago
,
Duke
administration
almost
succeeded
in
eliminating
health
insurance
for
most
students
on
financial
aid
.
The
policy
change
was
intentional
;
its
subtle
implementation
followed
by
the
administration’s
sheepish
reversal
in
the
face
of
public
pressure
reflected
a
university
more
concerned
with
saving
a
few
bucks
than
its
students’
access
to
basic
healthcare
.
Although
students
and
their
families
won
,
President
Price’s
explanation
of
the
decision
carried
an
implicit
threat
We
do
not
have
unlimited
financial
resources
.
.
.
the
broader
challenge
to
university
finances
has
not
gone
away
.
Price
left
the
fate
of
financial
aid
for
future
students
unclear
and
the
concerns
raised
by
students
regarding
summer
financial
support
,
work
study
,
and
continued
health
insurance
coverage
still
go
unaddressed
.
We’ve
heard
these
tepid
and
vague
reactions
from
university
decision
makers
many
times
before
,
in
the
non
response
responses
to
issues
like
racist
speech
scrawled
in
Black
cultural
spaces
or
the
concerns
of
protestors
like
the
LGBTQIA
students
in
the
Divinity
School
.
Such
agony
and
controversy
over
financial
aid
budgets
seems
laughable
in
the
wake
of
the
grand
opening
of
the
Karsh
Alumni
and
Visitors
Center
.
The
university
is
seemingly
willing
to
direct
donors
to
drop
32
million
on
a
complex
few
asked
for
,
a
space
dedicated
primarily
to
generating
more
donations
and
copying
Stanford
.
Duke
may
posture
and
self
congratulate
about
the
care
and
concern
it
applies
to
student
and
community
well
being
,
but
the
nbsp
;
but
millions
are
available
for
a
dynamic
branch
campus
in
China
,
a
best
in
class
Alumni
center
,
for
luxurious
dorms
somehow
stuffed
over
capacity
.
nbsp
;
The
rules
governing
university
finances
are
,
of
course
,
complicated
but
if
recent
columns
are
any
measure
of
student
needs
,
Duke’s
spending
decisions
raise
questions
asking
to
what
extent
those
priorities
consider
the
most
vulnerable
among
us
.
In
fact
,
we
can
interrogate
Duke’s
Strategic
Framework
to
see
if
a
gap
exists
between
stated
values
and
daily
practice
.
If
we
believe
that
Duke’s
brightest
and
boldest
thinkers
are
our
true
value
proposition
,
why
is
there
still
no
hate
amp
;
bias
policy
or
employees
,
which
would
signal
a
commitment
to
ensuring
our
community’s
safety
and
economic
security
?
If
we
believe
that
Duke
can
transform
teaching
and
discovery
,
why
did
Duke
hire
union
busting
,
top
dollar
law
firms
like
Proskauer
Rose
to
maintain
the
exploitation
of
graduate
students
and
contingent
faculty
labor
,
whose
victories
came
only
after
their
persistent
protest
?
If
Duke
prides
itself
in
its
graduate
contributions
to
teaching
,
why
did
Duke
concede
to
the
bare
minimum
of
a
12
month
stipend
,
while
grads
still
have
to
run
their
own
food
pantry
?
If
Duke
wants
to
build
a
renewed
campus
community
focused
on
our
well
being
,
why
does
Greek
Life
still
exist
and
where
is
the
material
investment
for
overwhelmed
Wellness
Center
services
?
If
Duke
hopes
to
forge
purposeful
partnerships
in
the
region
,
why
obstruct
discussion
on
the
light
rail
,
the
gas
plant
,
or
Parking
and
Transportation
abuse
of
workers
,
all
affecting
residents
of
this
region
?
If
Duke
values
knowledge
in
the
service
of
society
,
why
encourage
students
to
work
for
Palantir’s
deportation
abetting
machinery
,
threatening
undocumented
people
across
North
Carolina
?
These
practices
,
behaviors
,
and
incidents
are
less
about
individual
administrators
,
but
rather
reflect
systemic
injustice
.
Our
lived
experiences
as
students
,
faculty
,
staff
,
workers
,
and
community
members
are
lost
in
these
gaps
.
In
light
of
these
recent
histories
,
we
must
ask
who
has
Duke
been
changing
for
?
The
student
body
is
still
largely
drawn
from
America’s
wealthiest
families
,
where
69
pecent
of
students
come
from
the
top
20
percent
of
incomes
and
only
3
.
9
percent
come
from
the
bottom
20
percent
.
Duke
reproduces
wealth
and
income
inequality
by
refusing
to
end
legacy
admissions
one
wonders
if
our
percentage
of
legacy
admits
is
similar
to
Harvard’s
and
scaffolding
a
pipeline
to
the
numerous
corporations
populating
the
Career
Fair
,
a
symbol
of
the
futures
Duke
hopes
we
pursue
companies
like
Capital
One
,
ExxonMobil
,
and
Walmart
.
The
intended
byproduct
of
this
process
,
of
course
,
is
a
future
class
of
new
donors
hoping
to
slap
their
names
on
another
building
or
bench
,
as
evidenced
by
an
email
to
seniors
this
week
which
has
introduced
us
to
the
great
honor
of
donating
to
Duke
before
we
even
receive
our
degree
.
Indeed
,
Duke
is
a
blind
adherent
to
the
gospel
of
wealth
accumulation
and
do
good
philanthropy
this
past
week
,
the
Board
of
Trustees
honored
philanthropist
and
former
Board
chairman
David
Rubenstein
,
whose
occasional
donations
,
as
argued
by
former
student
Sydney
Roberts
,
obscure
violent
origins
in
his
private
equity
firm’s
displacement
of
poor
people
and
execution
of
mass
lay
offs
.
A
cursory
look
at
the
Board
of
Trustees
website
reveals
its
members
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
United
States’
gilded
elite
,
executives
at
firms
like
McKinsey
who
contract
with
ICE
and
exploit
Puerto
Rico’s
debt
crisis
,
Apple
manufacturer
of
microchips
in
military
missiles
,
and
ARAMARK
a
notorious
provider
of
inadequate
,
maggot
infested
food
in
prison
and
jails
,
turning
a
profit
on
caged
humans
.
In
sum
,
Duke
remains
committed
to
the
interests
of
the
wealthy
and
well
connected
who
in
turn
reshape
the
university
into
its
modern
corporate
form
.
And
for
the
rest
of
us
?
As
argued
by
my
fellow
columnist
Annie
Yang
,
we
are
reduced
to
customers
,
if
not
commodities
ourselves
.
Duke
does
not
love
us
.
It’s
about
time
we
realized
it
.
If
the
Chronicle
opinion
section
is
any
proxy
for
discussion
within
the
Duke
community
,
it
is
fair
to
say
that
polarization
is
at
the
heart
of
the
student
body’s
political
concerns
.
Political
polarization
is
a
popular
cause
to
lament
today
,
and
in
many
respects
,
it
is
worth
lamenting
.
Polarization
leads
to
such
democratic
unpleasantries
as
incivility
,
legislative
gridlock
and
a
lack
of
trust
in
institutions
.
These
unfortunate
phenomena
have
consequences
of
their
own
they
test
the
strength
of
the
democratic
experiment
.
Democracy
relies
on
civility
,
compromise
and
trust
in
institutions
,
and
polarization
is
eroding
those
principles
.
For
those
who
lament
polarization
,
the
data
are
not
pretty
.
The
ideological
center
of
each
party
has
split
dramatically
since
the
1970s
.
Whereas
collaboration
between
the
parties
was
commonplace
in
that
era
,
it
has
since
become
increasingly
rare
.
The
House
,
the
Senate
and
the
electorate
have
all
fled
to
the
ideological
poles
.
Polarization
and
partisanship
go
hand
in
hand
as
people
become
more
partisan
,
they
become
more
ideologically
polarized
.
And
as
they
become
more
ideologically
polarized
,
they
become
more
partisan
.
It
is
a
race
to
the
bottom
or
more
accurately
,
the
poles
.
Yet
although
polarization
may
appear
to
be
antithetical
to
American
democracy
,
the
two
are
inseparable
.
Indeed
,
the
polarization
that
we
see
today
is
a
natural
byproduct
of
our
democracy
.
This
is
democracy’s
homeostasis
a
state
the
Founding
Fathers
envisioned
.
George
Washington
may
have
preached
against
political
parties
,
but
some
of
the
more
prescient
founders
knew
that
factions
would
emerge
.
These
factions
have
never
been
cleanly
organized
,
but
rather
have
organically
formed
and
morphed
throughout
the
years
.
As
a
result
,
ideology
and
partisan
affiliation
were
often
mismatched
,
which
allowed
for
significant
cooperation
across
party
lines
.
As
the
parties
continued
to
evolve
,
they
became
more
ideologically
consistent
a
natural
and
expected
process
.
Since
ideology
and
party
have
converged
,
the
party
centers
have
diverged
,
leading
to
the
polarization
we
see
today
.
Your
father’s
conservative
ideology
did
not
necessarily
mean
he
was
a
Republican
;
your
mother’s
status
as
a
Democrat
did
not
necessarily
mean
she
was
a
liberal
.
It
is
a
modern
development
in
American
politics
that
your
ideology
defines
your
party
or
in
some
cases
,
vice
versa
.
A
1970
study
concluded
that
there
was
little
ideological
difference
in
the
following
of
the
two
major
American
political
parties
.
This
same
study
points
out
that
most
Americans
back
then
viewed
issues
in
partisan
rather
than
ideological
terms
.
This
is
a
stark
contrast
from
today
,
where
.
While
it
is
easy
to
romanticize
the
days
of
relative
bipartisan
cooperation
in
the
1970s
,
that
era
was
just
a
stepping
stool
to
democracy’s
final
form
which
are
still
yet
to
attain
.
Parties
were
patchwork
compilations
based
on
region
,
loyalty
,
and
a
variety
of
other
non
ideological
factors
.
They
were
loose
coalitions
without
clear
messages
or
clear
differences
between
them
.
While
this
incoherent
partisan
structure
where
a
Southern
Democrat
could
have
more
in
common
with
a
Southern
Republican
than
with
his
own
party
produced
more
bipartisan
compromise
,
was
it
really
a
better
system
?
Is
that
how
democracy
is
supposed
to
function
?
It
is
not
.
The
purpose
of
the
party
system
is
to
provide
voters
with
choices
,
to
allow
them
to
dictate
the
direction
of
the
nation
.
Voters
are
most
enabled
to
control
their
own
destiny
when
there
are
clear
distinctions
between
parties
.
When
there
is
significant
overlap
in
the
ideologies
of
the
two
parties
,
voters
are
left
confused
and
powerless
.
Conservative
ideologue
Barry
Goldwater
recognized
that
this
bipartisanship
was
not
how
the
parties
were
supposed
to
function
.
He
argued
that
the
more
distinct
the
parties
,
the
more
the
voter
is
offered
a
choice
,
not
an
echo
.
If
both
parties
echo
each
other
on
policy
,
then
voters
do
not
have
a
meaningful
say
.
Choice
is
a
democratic
ideal
,
brought
to
you
by
polarization
.
The
alignment
of
parties
with
ideology
is
a
natural
development
.
If
parties
are
to
be
aligned
around
anything
,
it
only
makes
sense
that
they
unite
around
a
core
set
of
values
and
principles
.
In
a
world
where
ideology
is
the
basis
for
policy
,
it
would
be
illogical
to
organize
parties
around
anything
other
than
ideology
.
James
Madison
foresaw
that
the
zeal
for
different
opinions
concerning
religion
,
concerning
government
,
and
many
other
points
were
the
basis
of
political
parties
.
Now
we
have
reached
a
point
where
differing
opinions
on
religion
,
government
,
and
many
other
points
have
indeed
become
the
dividing
lines
for
our
political
parties
.
As
the
Founders
intended
.
Polarization
is
like
seventh
grade
.
You
are
growing
up
,
but
now
you
have
acne
.
Your
voice
starts
to
squeak
.
You
begin
to
grow
hair
in
foreign
places
.
Natural
processes
are
not
always
smooth
sailing
,
and
with
the
good
comes
the
bad
.
Our
democracy
is
maturing
,
and
polarization
is
a
downside
.
Incivility
,
gridlock
,
and
a
lack
of
trust
in
institutions
are
democracy’s
voice
cracks
.
They
are
growing
pains
.
If
all
goes
right
,
America
will
hit
her
growth
spurt
,
reckon
with
the
negative
downsides
,
and
become
a
more
perfect
union
.
Let’s
play
Guess
the
Candidate
.
Imagine
a
presidential
candidate
who
threatened
to
opt
out
of
NAFTA
if
they
could
not
secure
a
better
deal
.
Suppose
this
candidate
opposed
amnesty
and
wanted
to
secure
our
borders
for
the
sake
of
America’s
sovereignty
.
nbsp
;
This
individual
argued
that
immigrants
must
pay
a
fine
,
learn
English
and
not
take
part
in
criminal
activity
if
they
wanted
citizenship
.
The
unidentified
candidate
was
also
proudly
opposed
to
Iraq
from
the
start
and
affirmed
that
marriage
is
a
sacred
union
between
a
man
and
a
woman
.
Who
could
this
be
?
Maybe
it
was
the
triangulator
in
chief
,
Hillary
Clinton
,
in
one
of
her
many
manifestations
.
But
,
of
course
,
it
can’t
be
Hillary
!
She
supported
Iraq
from
the
start
,
only
abandoning
the
war
after
she
felt
the
breeze
shift
.
Clearly
,
George
Bush
and
John
McCain
are
eliminated
on
similar
grounds
.
Perhaps
Hillary’s
husband
,
Bill
Clinton
,
authored
these
quotes
?
Nope
,
Bill
passed
NAFTA
in
the
first
place
.
Let’s
not
neglect
the
obvious
could
it
be
Trump
?
A
trade
skeptic
,
an
immigration
hawk
,
and
an
instinctive
isolationist
,
Trump’s
views
roughly
match
these
sentiments
.
But
it’s
not
Trump
.
The
preceding
Republican
nominee
,
Mitt
Romney
,
is
not
the
answer
either
.
The
author
of
these
statements
is
Barack
Obama
.
Does
anyone
remember
2008
?
Sure
,
we
all
remember
the
soaring
rhetoric
,
the
optimism
,
the
Hope
and
the
Change
.
We
certainly
remember
Obama’s
smashing
electoral
success
,
the
product
of
a
coalition
that
was
broad
enough
to
win
the
electoral
college
by
192
votes
and
deep
enough
to
win
the
popular
vote
by
over
7
percent
.
But
we
don’t
remember
the
voters
.
The
voters
who
delivered
swing
states
like
Ohio
,
Florida
,
Colorado
and
Nevada
.
The
voters
who
breached
Republican
strongholds
like
Indiana
,
North
Carolina
,
Virginia
and
Nebraska’s
2nd
district
.
Alongside
black
Democrats
,
these
voters
laid
the
foundation
for
a
60
vote
filibuster
proof
Senate
majority
by
delivering
crucial
seats
in
West
Virginia
,
Iowa
,
Arkansas
,
and
Louisiana
.
Neither
party
is
their
true
home
.
But
both
parties
need
them
.
They
are
moderates
,
but
they
have
nothing
in
common
with
Duke’s
socially
liberal
,
fiscally
conservative
population
that
progressives
so
despise
.
Fiscally
progressive
and
socially
conservative
,
they
are
the
median
voters
of
the
American
electorate
.
Meet
the
populists
.
Is
there
a
logical
reason
why
church
going
traditionalists
who
oppose
abortion
must
also
be
in
favor
of
lower
marginal
tax
rates
and
NAFTA
?
Apparently
not
.
A
recent
study
indicates
that
just
under
30
percent
of
the
electorate
holds
a
heterodox
grab
bag
of
positions
including
enthusiasm
for
Social
Security
,
opposition
to
immigration
,
skepticism
of
free
trade
,
and
concern
about
economic
inequality
.
Disaffected
and
alienated
,
these
voters
believe
the
system
is
rigged
and
thus
tend
to
gravitate
towards
outsiders
and
changemakers
.
Which
explains
a
peculiar
phenomenon
over
9
percent
of
2012
Obama
voters
also
voted
for
Trump
.
These
Obama
Trump
voters
were
overwhelmingly
populists
.
Narrowly
concentrated
in
the
Midwest
,
they
delivered
the
2016
election
to
Trump
.
Democrats
have
made
voters
feel
respected
just
not
all
voters
.
Uniformly
progressive
voters
,
the
voters
least
likely
to
ever
defect
from
the
party
,
have
been
pampered
like
never
before
.
By
contrast
,
populists
,
the
voters
Democrats
need
,
have
not
received
such
concern
.
For
immigration
skeptical
voters
,
Democrats
offer
de
facto
open
borders
policies
.
On
abortion
,
Democrats
refuse
to
endorse
any
sort
of
limit
.
Democrats
should
not
imply
that
social
conservatives
are
bizarre
outcasts
or
incels
,
as
Elizabeth
Warren
did
the
other
evening
.
That
,
like
Hillary’s
deplorables
moment
,
is
a
recipe
for
disaster
in
2020
.
Democrats
have
a
choice
.
And
no
,
that
choice
is
not
move
towards
the
right
or
lose
.
A
leftwing
economic
platform
is
an
electoral
asset
that
Democratic
candidates
should
keep
.
A
leftwing
social
platform
is
not
.
Obama
won
the
Presidency
twice
because
he
unified
disparate
groups
of
people
.
Simultaneously
,
he
drove
historic
turnout
amongst
black
voters
and
won
over
white
working
class
voters
.
He
did
this
by
emphasizing
his
leftward
economic
policies
,
embracing
populist
positions
on
key
issues
and
by
showing
toleration
of
socially
conservative
voters
.
Is
it
controversial
to
argue
that
Democrats
should
heed
the
lessons
of
their
latest
and
greatest
victory
?

Our

was
a

a
Durham

Oshrain
addressed
current

,
imploring
them
to

,
to
do
all
in
their
power
to
prevent

Oshrain's

If

this
letter
from
Lin
Giralt
,
Trinity

would

a
thoughtful
query
that
struck
a

with

Why

Although

disagreed
on
the
answer
to
Giralt's

,
they
certainly
took
his

pondered
the

clocks

Following

offered
the
only

of

he
felt
genuinely

in
the

Center

College
application
season
is
near
approaching
,
and
Duke
has
been
forced
to
keep
up
the
admissions
website
appears
to
be
more
enticing
than
ever
.
In
one
image
,
a
group
of
racially
diverse
students
sits
in
front
of
Baldwin
Auditorium
accompanied
by
the
heading
,
This
is
Duke
.
However
,
after
a
mere
few
days
as
a
student
at
this
institution
,
I
know
that
this’
whatever
this’
is
is
on
campus
were
,
indeed
,
nowhere
to
be
found
.
So
,
as
a
first
year
ingrained
with
the
Duke
Difference
philosophy
,
with
my
knowledge
of
my
own
whiteness
,
I
tasked
myself
with
answering
the
number
one
question
racing
through
my
mind
why
is
our
school
so
socially
separated
by
race
?
First
,
I
did
a
bit
of
digging
.
Some
in
the
form
of
online
research
,
some
through
interpersonal
relationships
,
some
within
myself
.
The
online
avenue
became
a
rabbit
hole
of
click
after
click
after
click
.
Click
.
Duke
has
yet
to
acknowledge
its
direct
ties
to
slavery
or
to
uplift
the
Black
people
who
worked
to
build
this
university
.
Click
.
Duke
deliberately
supported
the
destruction
of
Crest
Street
,
a
historically
Black
community
,
while
arguing
that
it
had
no
control
over
the
outcomes
of
the
neighborhood
.
Click
.
Duke
has
yet
to
remove
Executive
Vice
President
Tallman
Trask
III
,
who
in
2014
hit
a
parking
attendant
with
his
Porsche
and
allegedly
used
the
n
word
toward
her
,
from
office
.
From
the
wealth
of
information
I’d
gathered
through
Google
searches
,
I
learned
the
extent
to
which
Duke
is
centered
around
whiteness
,
around
white
supremacy
.
There
must
be
closed
spaces
in
which
students
of
color
are
comfortable
expressing
and
communicating
shared
narratives
that
classmates
not
adhering
to
their
specific
racial
group
cannot
understand
.
Race
shapes
socialization
,
which
shapes
life
experiences
.
But
when
campus
culture
whether
interpersonally
or
systemically
or
both
deems
whiteness
superior
,
for
some
students
of
color
,
closed
spaces
feel
like
the
only
nonviolent
spaces
to
exist
.
Racial
separation
then
becomes
a
means
of
survival
.
My
white
peers
and
I
self
segregate
.
Many
of
our
minority
classmates
self
preserve
.
Duke
has
attempted
to
somewhat
alleviate
this
disparity
through
random
first
year
roommate
assignment
.
This
policy
has
received
overwhelmingly
positive
feedback
and
is
cited
as
a
method
of
increasing
student
awareness
of
the
wide
range
of
identities
at
the
university
.
Although
this
initiative
undoubtedly
has
benefits
I
met
one
of
my
current
best
friends
through
random
assignment
it
is
a
continuation
of
historic
double
standard
legislation
.
Many
people
of
color
have
put
in
emotional
labor
throughout
their
entire
lives
to
appease
white
people
.
It
is
only
us
,
the
white
students
at
Duke
,
who
are
truly
educated
by
a
roommate
of
a
diverse
ethnic
background
.
And
our
roommate
,
while
being
a
source
of
this
education
,
is
perhaps
forced
to
accept
microaggressions
and
prejudice
in
their
living
space
.
This
column
is
not
the
first
time
someone
has
voiced
these
thoughts
.
Countless
nonwhite
students
have
been
articulating
the
importance
of
safe
spaces
and
the
prevalence
of
racism
on
campus
long
before
I
began
drafting
this
piece
.
But
I
write
all
of
the
above
knowing
that
it
is
important
for
white
students
to
acknowledge
our
own
flawed
preconceptions
.
I
write
all
of
the
above
knowing
that
I
am
not
perfect
.
Knowing
that
I
have
made
and
will
continue
to
make
so
many
mistakes
.
But
knowing
that
it
is
my
duty
to
use
my
privilege
to
speak
out
.
White
students
I
am
calling
on
us
to
change
.
I
am
calling
on
us
to
understand
that
we
are
responsible
for
educating
ourselves
for
understanding
the
homogenous
spaces
we’ve
created
.
We
can
listen
to
our
BIPOC
peers
,
rather
than
speaking
over
them
.
We
can
task
ourselves
with
being
intentional
about
making
friends
of
diverse
backgrounds
while
also
being
aware
of
the
danger
of
tokenization
.
We
can
call
out
and
or
call
in
our
white
peers
when
we
bear
witness
to
an
injustice
.
And
we
must
also
know
that
we
are
not
the
owners
of
allyship
;
we
do
not
get
to
define
what
it
entails
.
Although
nearly
half
its
population
is
comprised
of
students
of
color
,
Duke
is
not
be
the
utopia
of
diversity
boasted
on
the
admissions
website
.
And
I
cannot
,
in
good
faith
,
call
for
the
social
integration
of
Duke
if
this
forced
mingling
only
benefits
white
students
;
if
students
of
color
are
burdened
with
assimilating
into
white
space
.
White
students
truly
dedicated
to
reducing
this
racial
stratification
can
begin
by
evaluating
ourselves
how
we
interact
with
our
nonwhite
peers
,
our
implicit
biases
and
prejudices
,
and
our
actions
and
inaction
around
those
who
look
like
us
.
This
is
Duke
.
This’
is
racial
injustice
.
This’
is
white
supremacy

To
white
students
and
faculty
at
Duke
,
to
our
current
administration
,
to
our
unacknowledged
history
,
I
ask
one
final
question
is
this’
who
we
want
to
be
?
As
much
as
I
love
it
at
Duke
so
far
,
I
can
say
one
thing
for
sure
the
food
is
bland
.
The
spiciest
thing
I’ve
had
here
was
called
chili
broccoli
,
if
that
says
anything
.
So
when
I
heard
that
free
Indian
food
was
being
offered
at
a
pooja
religious
ceremony
,
I
knew
I
had
to
go
.
Who
knew
when
I
would
next
encounter
spicy
food
?
Running
in
rather
late
,
I
was
able
to
catch
just
the
ending
of
the
pooja
in
question
.
They
had
already
begun
the
final
part
aarthi
.
To
summarize
,
each
person
raises
a
candle
to
a
statue
of
god
in
this
case
,
Ganesha
and
offers
flowers
as
signs
of
respect
and
worship
.
To
be
entirely
honest
,
I
don’t
know
the
full
details
behind
the
prayer
or
why
it
is
normally
done
at
the
end
of
ceremonies
.
The
important
part
,
however
,
is
that
a
chant
is
recited
by
the
entire
congregation
.
Namely
,
Om
Jai
Jagdish
Hare
.
As
the
group
began
to
chant
the
hymn
,
however
,
there
was
hesitation
faltering
.
A
graduate
student
had
to
take
initiative
and
sing
it
himself
as
others
chimed
in
sporadically
.
For
a
song
Hindus
recite
regularly
at
religious
rituals
,
it
seemed
all
of
us
were
unaware
of
the
lyrics
.
And
it
wasn’t
just
Hindus
at
Duke
this
was
a
group
of
Hindus
religious
enough
to
attend
a
religious
ceremony
at
9
p
.
m
.
on
a
Thursday
.
Despite
this
fact
,
I
along
with
most
others
mumbled
along
to
the
chant
.
I
felt
ashamed
in
many
ways
;
as
a
child
,
I
had
many
of
the
religious
hymns
and
chants
memorized
,
but
now
,
it
seemed
that
I
couldn’t
remember
the
most
common
one
.
Where
had
my
knowledge
gone
?
Why
was
it
so
difficult
to
remember
?
It
dawned
on
me
the
problem
at
hand
there
weren’t
any
parents
present
.
As
much
as
it
embarrasses
me
to
admit
it
,
it
was
always
the
parents
who
led
religious
rituals
at
home
.
They
knew
the
songs
,
they
knew
the
process
,
and
they
were
able
to
remind
us
of
how
to
worship
.
Religion
has
always
been
an
important
part
of
my
life
,
but
it
wasn’t
until
now
that
I
realized
how
fragile
it
is
.
Everything
,
from
the
daily
observances
to
special
events
and
festivals
,
requires
some
special
care
and
knowledge
and
devotion
.
Perhaps
the
scariest
part
of
this
experience
was
realizing
that
I
had
to
pick
up
the
mantle
.
This
is
the
time
during
which
I
should
study
religion
and
learn
how
to
practice
it
.
Because
,
as
I
realized
in
writing
this
,
I
will
have
to
supervise
my
children
as
they
learn
religion
.
My
ignorance
would
carry
on
to
them
.
From
here
,
I
learned
my
major
lesson
from
that
night
if
I
didn’t
choose
to
keep
my
religion
alive
and
well
,
no
one
else
would
.
Not
to
mention
,
unlike
in
the
past
,
many
people
don’t
live
near
their
parents
anymore
.
Who
is
there
to
remind
us
to
celebrate
our
rituals
,
our
traditions
,
and
our
religion
?
We
don’t
have
anyone
to
correct
us
or
to
give
us
support
during
rituals
.
In
many
ways
,
a
modern
Hindu
is
left
to
their
own
devices
regarding
religion
,
and
many
of
us
seem
unprepared
for
that
task
.
No
one
will
step
in
to
save
all
the
religious
rituals
and
rites
,
because
they
are
mine
to
protect
.
When
someone
has
a
question
about
Hinduism
,
it
is
on
me
to
respond
and
to
be
educated
.
And
,
if
I
ignore
my
responsibility
,
then
I
have
no
right
to
complain
if
my
tradition
,
religion
,
and
culture
just
become
footnotes
in
a
textbook
.
It’s
safe
to
say
that
religion
has
been
very
different
at
Duke
than
it
was
at
home
,
but
not
all
of
it
has
been
scary
.
In
the
same
vein
of
wanting
to
expand
my
connection
and
understanding
of
religion
,
I
joined
a
small
Bhagavad
Gita
reading
group
.
At
home
,
I
had
never
really
discussed
the
Gita
with
other
Hindus
or
had
a
place
to
learn
about
the
text
.
Instead
of
doing
independent
study
,
I
can
actually
talk
about
my
perspective
and
have
it
challenged
.
In
a
way
,
I
can
really
come
to
grips
with
what
it
means
to
be
Hindu
by
talking
about
it
with
others
.
My
most
different
experiences
have
been
outside
my
own
religion
.
The
university
setting
lends
itself
to
a
very
close
relationship
between
different
faiths
.
Until
a
few
weeks
ago
,
I
had
never
sat
through
a
full
Sunday
Christian
worship
service
.
At
home
,
I
likely
wouldn’t
have
considered
driving
on
a
Sunday
morning
to
attend
a
service
;
sitting
on
a
ten
minute
bus
ride
to
the
Chapel
,
however
,
was
simple
and
low
effort
.
In
a
way
,
it
made
it
easy
for
me
to
consider
having
a
new
religious
experience
.
It
wasn’t
the
same
as
a
small
group
praying
or
discussing
scripture
;
in
fact
,
I
haven’t
seen
Hindus
perform
regular
services
with
sermons
and
congregational
prayer
.
It
just
isn’t
common
,
at
least
not
among
American
Hindu
temples
.
The
experience
was
refreshing
and
eye
opening
.
It
was
simply
satisfying
to
see
a
large
group
of
people
came
together
to
pray
.
Although
I
didn’t
say
all
of
the
prayers
or
hymns
,
I
did
feel
a
connection
to
a
few
.
For
one
,
I
didn’t
recite
the
Apostles’
Creed
.
But
I
did
read
along
in
the
New
Testament
lessons
and
listen
to
the
sermon
.
There
was
something
to
understanding
God
and
worship
from
a
new
perspective
,
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
think
I
would
have
had
this
experience
at
home
.
And
thank
goodness
that
I
did
,
too
.
I
understand
Christianity
in
a
new
lense
,
in
a
new
fashion
that
I
wouldn’t
have
before
.

Being
at
Duke
isn’t
just
about
academics
or
extracurriculars
for
a
career
.
A
major
function
of
university
life
is
to
allow
students
to
become
well
rounded
in
their
wisdom
.
Students
are
introduced
to
global
perspectives
,
gain
social
skills
,
and
expand
their
scope
of
understanding
.
Why
limit
this
to
learning
about
race
,
gender
,
or
nationality
?
University
should
also
be
a
place
of
expanding
the
religious
literacy
and
understanding
of
the
students
.
The
world
the
United
States
included
remains
very
religiously
diverse
.
Can
an
education
be
complete
without
discussing
this
facet
of
human
life
?
For
me
,
my
experiences
with
religion
away
from
home
have
translated
to
a
few
truths
.
Don’t
forget
to
practice
religion
.
Don’t
lose
track
of
tradition
while
chasing
academics
.
And
don’t
just
invest
in
one
faith
.
Duke
has
proven
itself
to
be
a
wonderful
place
to
explore
religion
,
both
as
a
global
concept
and
in
its
many
local
varieties
.
This
campus
not
only
has
numerous
religious
groups
in
close
proximity
they
are
each
open
to
sharing
their
perspectives
.
I
know
that
I
have
a
lot
more
to
learn
and
to
experience
I
haven’t
even
been
to
Shabbat
yet
!
As
an
organization
rooted
in
Jewish
values
,
Jewish
Voice
for
Peace's
Triangle
Chapter
is
disturbed
to
learn
that
Tzipi
Livni
is
being
hosted
by
Duke
University
exactly
two
weeks
after
our
observance
of
Yom
Kippur
,
our
holiest
of
holy
days
.
For
those
unfamiliar
with
Livni
,
who
has
been
charged
as
an
international
war
criminal
by
three
nations
due
to
her
military
leadership
in
Occupation
Cast
Lead
,
we
encourage
you
to
read
Duke
senior
Lama
Hantash's
October
21
article
Don't
Bring
an
Accused
War
Criminal
to
Campus
.
This
article
enumerates
and
cites
many
of
Livni's
egregious
activities
,
including
overseeing
military
action
which
claimed
many
of
the
nearly
1500
lives
lost
throughout
Israel's
2008
2009
Operation
Cast
Lead
most
of
whom
were
civilians
and
over
300
of
whom
were
children
.
While
her
more
recent
endeavors
pay
lip
service
to
equal
rights
and
bipartisanship
,
she
remains
at
her
core
an
Israeli
apologist
,
spinning
attention
away
from
its
human
rights
abuses
,
and
her
own
,
by
creating
the
illusion
of
a
moderate
Israeli
left
playing
the
good
cop
to
Netanyahu's
bad
cop
and
maintaining
an
unacceptable
status
quo
.
For
Jewish
people
,
two
weeks
ago
marked
a
culmination
of
40
days
of
contemplation
,
atonement
,
prayer
,
and
t'shuvah
.
It
is
a
time
when
custom
dictates
that
we
check
in
with
those
with
whom
we
have
conflict
and
make
right
our
wrongs
to
the
best
of
our
ability
.
Our
great
sage
Maimonides
outlines
nine
steps
to
help
us
in
this
task
of
accountability
.
The
first
step
is
recognizing
what
we
did
as
wrong
or
hurtful
.
Livni
shows
no
acknowledgement
of
her
crimes
.
In
2009
,
near
the
end
of
Operation
Cast
Lead
,
she
stated
,
Israel
is
a
country
that
when
you
fire
on
its
citizens
it
responds
by
going
wild
and
this
is
a
good
thing
.
The
second
step
is
to
feel
remorse
about
having
done
it
.
Yet
Livni
has
said
when
talking
about
Operation
Cast
Lead
and
her
arrest
warrants
that
she
would
repeat
each
and
every
decision
.
nbsp
;
Her
comments
reveal
a
taste
for
violence
rather
than
an
attitude
of
remorse
.
The
third
stage
of
t'shuvah
is
to
stop
engaging
in
the
harmful
activity
.
In
2008
,
after
hundreds
of
Gazans
had
just
been
killed
,
Livni
ordered
an
aggressive
international
media
campaign
to
gain
support
for
the
IDF’s
operation
.
Livni's
speaking
engagement
at
Duke
this
week
falls
into
this
established
pattern
of
propagandizing
on
behalf
of
the
State
of
Israel
,
demonstrating
that
she
fails
this
step
as
well
.
We
could
pursue
the
remainder
of
Maimonides'
list
,
or
we
could
pause
and
realize
that
this
war
criminal
poses
a
threat
to
Palestinians
both
in
their
ancestral
homeland
and
in
diaspora
.
Palestinian
and
other
students
at
Duke
should
not
be
retraumatized
as
the
educational
institution
responsible
for
their
growth
hosts
Tzipi
Livni
.
Duke
does
not
need
to
pay
Tzipi
Livni
a
rumored
massive
honorarium
and
provide
her
with
a
platform
from
which
she
can
continue
to
advance
her
harmful
agenda
.
In
so
doing
,
Duke
becomes
complicit
in
Israel's
ongoing
project
of
ethnic
cleansing
.
With
registration
looming
around
the
corner
,
the
reality
of
having
just
one
more
semester
left
is
starting
to
sink
in
.
Bookbagging
has
always
been
a
tumultuous
process
full
of
contemplating
what
if’s
as
I
spend
hours
scrolling
through
DukeHub
and
asking
for
recommendations
from
friends
.
And
as
my
time
here
grows
closer
to
an
end
,
so
does
the
opportunity
to
explore
freely
.
Now
,
I
see
classes
as
an
opportunity
to
juggle
multiple
interests
.
But
it
took
me
longer
than
I
would’ve
liked
to
expand
my
bookbag
.
During
my
first
two
years
at
Duke
,
I
was
focused
on
nabbing
as
many
requirements
as
I
could
for
my
major
.
I
brushed
off
suggestions
from
my
advisor
as
I
opted
to
instead
continue
grinding
through
a
full
STEM
course
load
.
Like
many
students
,
I
fretted
over
my
employment
prospects
.
Without
a
prior
computer
science
background
,
I
felt
incredibly
behind
.
What
was
the
point
of
forking
over
nearly
if
I
couldn’t
snag
a
job
?
Being
competitive
meant
cramming
as
many
STEM
classes
as
possible
.
In
one
of
my
semesters
,
I
had
linear
algebra
in
the
morning
;
statistics
right
after
;
and
then
an
hour
break
,
before
begrudgingly
dragging
myself
to
a
computer
architecture
class
.
But
rather
than
catching
up
,
it
felt
like
the
gap
only
widened
.
I
dreaded
going
to
lecture
.
I
had
no
idea
what
was
going
on
.
And
,
frankly
,
I
didn’t
care
that
I
was
lost
in
fact
,
I
didn’t
actually
care
about
I
was
learning
.
I
thought
this
misery
was
normal
.
It
wasn’t
until
I
finally
had
the
courage
to
break
out
of
the
STEM
bubble
,
that
my
entire
outlook
on
Duke
classes
shifted
.
For
the
first
time
,
I
left
class
invigorated
.
Rather
than
skimming
my
readings
,
I
poured
over
them
and
searched
for
more
.
The
spark
of
intellectual
stimulation
had
finally
appeared
.
Students
often
poke
fun
at
humanities
degrees
,
but
my
philosophy
and
ethics
class
have
been
the
most
rewarding
.
These
are
the
places
where
my
opinions
have
been
challenged
and
re
shaped
;
my
logical
reasoning
refined
.
I
came
to
Duke
for
the
people
around
me
and
the
intimate
debates
about
life
in
these
classes
have
had
the
biggest
impact
in
my
education
.
When
I
leave
,
it
is
the
insights
about
justice
and
morality
will
shape
me
;
not
the
finer
workings
of
mathematics
.
The
quality
of
my
Duke
experience
has
increased
immeasurably
since
I
began
choosing
a
broader
range
of
classes
.
It
makes
a
much
bigger
difference
than
you’d
think
;
after
all
,
each
semester
is
marked
by
what
we
commit
to
and
our
schedules
are
defined
by
our
classes
.
So
,
don’t
underestimate
the
importance
of
bookbagging
.
It’s
a
messy
,
stressful
process
.
But
I
hope
this
short
list
of
classes
can
serve
as
a
starting
point
.
Not
all
of
them
are
offered
this
semester
but
if
not
,
I
promise
that
it’s
worth
to
check
again
in
the
fall
.
And
even
if
you
find
these
offerings
boring
,
I
hope
you’ll
still
take
the
time
to
consider
something
new

The
Double
Ds
I'm
looking
at
today
are
Duke
Difference
,
and
how
this
simple
phrase
extends
beyond
jokes
about
academic
excellence
and
occasional
weird
happenings
on
campus
.
Even
though
I’ve
only
been
on
this
campus
for
two
months
,
I’ve
already
had
my
fair
share
of
Duke
Difference
moments
.
The
first
one
came
mere
moments
after
I
stepped
out
of
my
car
on
move
in
day
.
As
soon
as
my
feet
hit
the
ground
,
a
herd
of
upperclassmen
swarmed
me
like
vultures
,
hauling
my
stuff
up
to
the
second
floor
like
pack
animals
in
flashy
neon
fun
.
And
I
couldn’t
help
but
think
to
myself
,
Duke
Difference
moment
right
there
.
Now
,
we
fast
forward
to
an
important
day
in
the
life
of
the
first
year
Duke
student
Shooters
night
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
the
wholesome
junk
is
behind
the
young
Padawan
,
and
it
hits
him
for
the
first
time
that
he’s
a
college
student
.
By
induction
,
this
also
means
he’s
a
sardine
in
a
tin
can
,
branded
with
a
black
X
across
his
non
dominant
hand
,
wondering
if
the
puddles
he’s
wading
through
are
ethyl
alcohol
or
perspiration
.
And
the
night
doesn’t
end
there
for
our
young
lad
.
Somehow
and
he’s
a
little
too
inebriated
to
remember
exactly
how
he
ends
up
paying
a
visit
to
the
Holy
Land
.
No
,
I’m
not
saying
he
died
.
That’s
really
more
of
a
midterm
season
sort
of
issue
.
I’m
talking
about
McDonald's
the
place
where
a
red
haired
clown
rains
root
vegetable
on
hungry
students’
trays
at
three
in
the
morning
.
All
for
the
low
,
low
price
of
three
food
points
.
And
thus
ends
a
night
full
of
Duke
Differences
.
Soon
enough
,
the
little
freshman
has
to
work
as
hard
as
he
plays
.
The
Duke
Difference
goes
from
wild
nights
out
to
that
one
time
he
was
late
to
class
because
a
bus
driver
literally
yanked
him
off
of
a
full
C1
.
If
you
know
,
you
know
.
The
Duke
Difference
becomes
that
face
he
makes
when
Professor
Fullenkamp
says
that
he
expects
everyone
to
end
this
class
with
a
Satisfactory
.
I’m
sure
his
first
midterm
grade
,
coupled
with
hundreds
of
students
on
RateMyProfessor
,
would
strongly
beg
to
differ
.
However
,
I’m
not
saying
the
Duke
Difference
is
all
stress
.
Picture
,
for
instance
,
that
night
when
the
young
freshman
looks
up
from
his
computer
after
six
hours
of
poring
over
a
bootlegged
copy
of
Locke’s
Second
Treatise
only
to
still
see
sitting
around
him
the
six
friends
he
started
studying
with
earlier
.
Sure
,
they
all
have
death
written
across
their
faces
,
but
it’s
nice
to
see
that
everyone’s
in
the
same
boat
suffering
,
but
also
thriving
.
Personally
,
Duke
Difference
moments
have
given
me
some
of
my
best
friends
.
Take
,
for
instance
,
that
time
I
fished
a
shirt
out
from
behind
the
washers
for
a
girl
I’d
never
met
.
She
didn’t
look
happy
to
see
it
covered
in
washer
sludge
and
Tide
pod
residue
,
but
we’re
somehow
friends
now
.

I’m
not
going
to
act
like
the
Duke
Difference
is
all
sunshine
and
rainbows
,
though
.
We’re
used
to
thinking
of
the
phrase
as
sort
of
tongue
in
cheek
referencing
how
,
despite
our
strong
intellectual
culture
,
we
can
still
have
fun
and
do
dumb
things
.
My
argument
,
though
,
is
that
there’s
some
such
moments
,
often
not
thought
of
as
Duke
Differences
,
that
we
could
definitely
do
without
.
During
O
week
,
I
learned
that
48
percent
of
female
undergraduate
students
at
Duke
are
sexually
assaulted
during
their
time
on
campus
.
A
little
digging
yielded
that
,
on
average
,
that
percentage
is
definitely
lower
around
twenty
percentage
points
lower
,
in
fact
.
Like
it
or
not
,
that
is
indeed
a
part
of
the
Duke
Difference
.
On
FDOC
,
the
floors
of
Marketplace
were
riddled
with
QR
codes
.
Upon
scanning
one
,
I
was
redirected
to
a
site
called
the
Duke
Sexual
Assault
Project
that
claimed
to
keep
a
running
counter
of
every
time
someone
reported
being
sexually
assaulted
.
It
was
only
eight
hours
into
the
first
day
of
class
,
and
already
,
that
number
was
at
one
.
The
Duke
Difference
.
We
are
number
one
.
Later
that
day
,
I
checked
the
site
again
,
and
to
my
utter
confusion
,
the
counter
was
sitting
at
a
big
,
fat
zero
.
There
are
a
lot
of
things
in
this
world
that
can
be
undone
,
reset
or
rewritten
.
Entire
histories
can
be
repainted
for
the
convenience
of
undemocratic
governments
.
A
person
who
commits
a
crime
will
often
get
a
second
chance
.
But
sexual
assault
isn’t
one
of
those
things
.
There
is
no
undoing
that
action
no
minimizing
that
number
.
Once
it
goes
up
,
it
stays
.
I
checked
back
at
that
site
soon
after
.
The
domain
no
longer
exists
.
The

percent
figure
,
however
,
still
does
.
The
good
news
is
that
it
doesn’t
have
to
stay
that
way
.
That
percentage
can
surely
decrease
if
we
work
hard
to
change
campus
culture
.
To
redefine
the

Difference

conversations
about
the
meaning
of
life
,
and
fun
nights
out
as
opposed
to
statistics
we’re
too
afraid
to
talk
about
outside
of
closed
doors
.
I’ve
only
been
here
for
two
months
,
but
I’m
already
excited
to
see
what
the
next
Duke
Difference
moment
will
be
.
Because
that
phrase
,
to
me
,
is
what
makes
this
place
special
.
What
makes
this
place
a
home
.
I
just
hope
we’re
doing
our
best
to
make
it
a
home
for
all
seven
thousand
of
us
.
I
was
20
years
old
before
I
took
my
family’s
history
seriously
.
A
month
in
Atlanta
for
a
fellowship
,
where
I
listened
to
a
friend
share
his
ancestral
stories
,
finally
shook
me
from
my
self
absorbed
daze
so
I
could
reflect
on
my
place
among
familial
roots
teeming
with
stories
to
listen
to
,
research
,
carry
with
me
.
Of
course
,
the
irony
of
a
History
major
who
failed
to
know
his
own
was
not
lost
on
me
.
Later
that
night
,
stirred
by
my
friend
,
I
remember
calling
my
maternal
grandmother
to
ask
for
any
and
every
story
about
her
side
of
the
family
.
My
grandma
told
me
about
Amache
Ochinee
Prowers
,
her
great
grandmother
.
Amache
,
a
member
of
the
Southern
Cheyenne
Tribe
in
late
19th
century
Colorado
,
operated
multiple
businesses
and
raised
ten
children
with
her
husband
,
a
white
man
named
John
Wesley
Prowers
.
Amache
was
also
the
daughter
of
Cheyenne
Peace
Chief
Ochinee
,
who
was
murdered
in
1864
along
with
160
other
indigenous
people
by
Colonel
John
Chivington
and
the
Colorado
Volunteer
Cavalry
,
in
what
became
known
as
the
.
Amache
petitioned
and
won
reparations
from
the
federal
government
for
her
family’s
loss
.
She
used
her
compensation
to
build
wealth
and
stability
for
her
family
while
persistently
maintaining
ties
to
her
indigenous
heritage
.
The
Colorado
Women’s
Hall
of
Fame
Amache
in
2018
for
her
activism
,
a
ceremony
attended
by
my
grandmother
.
Today
,
Prowers
County
in
Colorado
is
named
for
John
and
Amache’s
family
.
Knowing
Amache
,
however
,
gives
me
a
small
glimpse
into
the
life
of
a
remarkable
woman
who
left
a
better
world
for
her
descendants
.
is
one
of
many
,
long
ignored
stories
about
the
lives
of
Native
American
women
in
the
19th
century
American
West
.
Amache’s
story
also
opened
a
new
connection
between
my
grandma
and
me
,
one
I’d
failed
to
appreciate
growing
up
.
We
found
a
way
to
spend
time
together
despite
hundreds
of
miles
of
separation
.
More
,
I
my
grandma
differently
.
She
had
inherited
a
fierce
dedication
to
her
family
a
dedication
I
saw
clearly
whenever
she
brokered
peace
among
warring
siblings
or
tagged
my
cousins
and
me
in
viral
Facebook
memes
about
the
joy
of
having
grandkids
.
Digging
through
Amache’s
story
naturally
made
me
curious
about
my
Dad’s
side
.
Eugene
Nuzzolillo
,
my
grandfather
,
looms
large
though
he
never
stood
more
than
5’4’’
.
Born
in
Morcone
,
Italy
in
1923
,
not
far
from
Naples
,
Eugene
immigrated
to
the
United
States
in
the
1940s
two
decades
after
my
uncle
Pellegrino
,
who
made
it
to
New
York
as
a
stowaway
a
story
for
another
time
.
He
married
Marie
Russo
in
Hempstead
,
New
York
,
and
settled
in
Connecticut
to
work
and
raise
his
4
kids
.
Eugene
worked
as
a
plasterer
and
lived
on
Marion
Avenue
near
a
few
more
Nuzzolillo’s
Libero
,
Vito
,
Domenick
,
Catherine
and
Benjamin
.
Each
Nuzzolillo
was
employed
as
a
plasterer
,
custodian
,
or
construction
worker
.
Like
millions
of
blue
collar
immigrants
,
Eugene
worked
diligently
,
sent
his
adult
kids
off
to
college
and
careers
,
and
retired
early
from
his
final
job
repairing
motors
at
General
Electric
.
I’m
named
for
Eugene
,
but
I
knew
him
as
Papi
and
he
called
me
Gino
.
Though
it’s
been
over
six
years
since
he
passed
and
my
memories
of
him
continue
to
fade
,
I
still
remember
walking
together
through
his
small
vegetable
garden
,
watching
attentively
as
he
crafted
his
homemade
biscotti
and
pasta
and
tomato
sauce
in
the
kitchen
.
I
remember
telling
him
about
my
first
kindergarten
love
,
Natalie
,
and
spotting
slightly
confused
amusement
in
his
smile
.
I
don’t
have
much
left
of
Papi
besides
small
clues
in
old
documents
and
my
family’s
memories
.
When
I
find
or
hear
of
any
small
piece
of
his
life
,
an
unrelenting
sense
of
curiosity
and
awe
pulls
me
to
know
him
more
,
reminds
me
of
his
legacy
living
in
my
Dad
and
his
siblings
who
match
Papi’s
humor
,
soberness
,
and
thoughtfulness
.
Even
in
his
death
,
these
fragments
bring
me
closer
to
him
.
Knowing
him
allows
me
to
understand
myself
as
the
consequence
of
intergenerational
love
and
hard
work
.
We
need
these
touchpoints
to
our
families
,
especially
in
college
.
Many
of
us
struggle
with
isolation
and
anxiety
at
school
,
made
worse
by
the
knowledge
of
our
inevitable
plunge
into
an
uncertain
adulthood
.
We
struggle
with
knowing
ourselves
and
what
we
want
in
a
period
of
disorienting
change
.
Learning
our
family’s
history
can
tether
us
to
some
sort
of
lineage
and
ground
ourselves
in
deeper
relationships
with
living
family
members
.
Still
,
family
histories
can
be
painful
,
messy
,
incomplete
;
they
might
reopen
wounds
long
since
closed
.
Not
everyone
claims
the
same
type
of
family
,
and
family
isn’t
always
or
even
often
defined
by
biology
.
Yet
,
for
whoever
and
whatever
we
call
family
,
we
can
only
come
to
know
ourselves
by
knowing
where
we
came
from
.
Tugging
at
these
stories
honestly
,
embracing
them
in
their
challenges
and
complexities
,
can
radically
change
what
we
believe
,
how
we
act
,
and
what
we
feel
we’re
called
to
do
.

In
January
2017
,
Tamar
Adler
,
contributor
to
wrote
an
online
essay
for
magazine
called
Everyone
Should
Have
a
House
Meal
.
This
article
has
since
become
a
foundational
and
irreplaceable
part
of
how
I
understand
and
value
home
cooking
.
But
what
is
a
house
meal
?
Adler
lays
out
the
essentials
A
house
meal
must
be
adaptable
as
a
chameleon
,
made
of
basic
ingredients
,
fast
,
culinarily
undemanding
,
and
seem
neither
a
sin
nor
a
charity
to
consume
.
We
return
to
the
house
meal
again
and
again
,
night
after
night
.
When
the
whole
family
is
plagued
by
the
flu
,
or
it
gets
dark
at
4
p
.
m
.
,
or
there
is
hardly
time
enough
to
eat
,
much
less
prepare
a
full
supper
,
the
house
meal
is
the
only
dinner
that
will
suffice
.
Perhaps
entirely
subconsciously
,
this
meal
is
decided
upon
,
prepared
and
consumed
more
than
any
other
because
it
fills
and
satisfies
more
than
just
hungry
bellies
.
I
can
easily
identify
my
family’s
house
meal
the
dish
my
sisters
and
I
affectionately
deemed
chicken
goo
when
we
were
little
.
The
essential
ingredient
is
in
the
title
,
but
of
course
there
are
also
carrots
and
celery
.
nbsp
;
Onions
and
garlic
,
maybe
chopped
parsley
or
thyme
and
plenty
of
salt
and
freshly
cracked
black
pepper
.
There
must
be
a
broth
or
a
gravy
,
something
saucy
to
offset
my
parents’
most
minor
of
sins
occasionally
leaving
the
chicken
in
the
oven
for
a
few
moments
too
long
.
The
chicken
is
roasted
with
potatoes
,
ladled
with
egg
noodles
,
poured
over
leftover
Chinese
takeout
rice
or
scooped
up
with
a
crusty
hunk
of
that
temporarily
forgotten
loaf
of
bread
.
nbsp
;
Without
a
doubt
,
my
family
ate
some
variation
of
these
essential
components
more
than
once
a
week
,
no
matter
the
season
or
reason
.
And
when
I’m
home
,
nothing
makes
me
happier
than
the
first
night
we
have
chicken
pot
pie
or
noodle
soup
.
Sometimes
,
you
just
need
to
make
and
eat
some
chicken
goo
.
But
college
is
a
strange
period
of
rootlessness
that
interrupts
all
sorts
of
routines
and
favorites
.
One
of
my
favorite
Tweets
reads
,
College
is
weird
bc
home
doesn’t
feel
like
home
and
college
doesn’t
feel
like
home
so
you’re
basically
like
homeless
ya
know
?
When
I
returned
home
for
the
first
time
,
during
winter
break
of
my
first
year
,
I
absolutely
experienced
that
unsettling
feeling
of
foreignness
and
distance
in
my
own
house
.
My
younger
sisters
were
closer
and
had
a
dozen
inside
jokes
that
I
hadn’t
experienced
;
my
parents
had
sold
the
trusty
Toyota
Sienna
minivan
I
had
driven
for
all
of
high
school
;
friends
I
had
known
since
fifth
grade
were
oddly
unrecognizable
.
But
if
this
is
no
longer
my
home
,
is
home
now
at
Duke
?
If
I
can
no
longer
claim
chicken
goo
,
then
what
is
my
new
house
meal
?
Even
with
senior
year
already
settled
uncomfortably
but
unshakably
on
my
shoulders
,
there
are
plenty
of
times
when
I
feel
like
this
place
cannot
possibly
be
my
home
when
I
spent
my
Friday
night
watching
when
yet
another
wave
of
business
casual
suits
and
dresses
parades
past
and
I
know
it’s
consulting
recruitment
;
when
I
see
classmates
not
just
passing
but
outright
excelling
on
a
level
far
beyond
me
.
I
have
spent
years
wondering
if
I
could
claim
this
place
as
my
home
,
and
some
days
it
feels
like
I’m
the
only
one
doubting
.
Maybe
I
simply
do
not
have
a
Duke
house
meal
.
nbsp
;
nbsp
;
But
as
Adler
writes
,
the
best
part
of
the
house
meal
is
its
versatility
.
There
is
no
golden
standard
for
Wright
Family
Chicken
Goo
.
For
variety
,
it
might
be
done
with
sweet
potatoes
or
parsnips
or
sautéed
kale
from
our
local
farmshare
.
There’s
no
recipe
,
and
it’s
never
made
the
same
way
twice
,
and
sure
,
there
are
some
iterations
of
chicken
goo
that
I
like
more
than
others
.
Part
of
what
makes
chicken
goo
so
surprisingly
delightful
is
how
it’s
different
from
meal
to
meal
,
and
chef
to
chef
.
nbsp
;
nbsp
;
Maybe
it’s
not
that
I
don’t
have
a
Duke
house
meal
.
Maybe
and
I’ll
admit
I
like
this
possibility
better
it’s
not
a
single
dish
but
a
combination
of
every
experience
,
class
and
meal
I
have
had
here
.
It’s
the
endearing
awkwardness
of
Marketplace
dinners
and
picnic
lunches
in
the
Gardens
.
It’s
a
hot
dog
at
Wallace
Wade
,
a
falafel
wrap
from
Gussy’s
during
P
Checks
,
an
LDOC
snow
cone
on
the
Chapel
quad
.
It’s
equal
parts
Cookout
milkshake
and
Chick
fil
A
nuggets
briefly
leaving
politics
far
,
far
to
the
side
.
It’s
absolutely
anything
from
Div
Café
or
The
Loop
.

I
still
feel
out
of
place
sometimes
,
both
in
my
childhood
and
college
homes
.
I
still
wonder
if
I’m
doing
the
Duke
thing
right
,
talking
to
the
right
people
,
taking
the
right
classes
.
But
having
studied
and
laughed
and
cried
and
loved
and
eaten
in
this
place
for
the
last
three
years
,
I
do
know
that
like
any
family’s
house
meal
,
there
is
not
one
way
to
make
your
four
years
at
Duke
.
nbsp
;
Chicken
goo
changes
every
time
,
and
is
all
the
better
for
it
.
I
would
not
have
thought
that
a
Daily
Mail
article
about
women’s
Tinder
profiles
was
evidence
that
the
entire
modern
world
equates
being
well
behaved
with
being
sheepishly
reticent
,
but
this
is
the
point
Lizzie
Bond
makes
in
her
column
,
The
case
for
well
behaved
women
and
men
.
She
argues
that
contrary
to
popular
belief
,
good
manners
are
not
arbitrary
and
antiquated
and
even
standards
of
behavior
,
but
a
path
to
virtuousness
.
Calling
politeness
a
well
behaved
way
of
interacting
with
one’s
fellow
man
and
a
conditioning
for
a
soul
ordered
in
virtue
ignores
the
fact
that
being
polite
does
not
look
the
same
for
everyone
.
Women
,
people
of
color
,
queer
people
,
and
many
other
marginalized
groups
are
expected
to
be
courteous
and
polite
at
all
times
.
Held
to
a
much
higher
standard
,
when
they
fall
short
,
the
consequences
can
be
life
altering
.
A
2015
paper
from
the
National
Bureau
of
Economic
Research
found
that
not
only
are
black
workers
more
heavily
monitored
by
their
employers
,
but
because
black
workers
are
more
closely
scrutinized
,
it
increases
the
chance
that
errors
large
or
small
will
be
caught
It’s
more
likely
that
a
black
employee
would
be
let
go
for
these
errors
than
a
white
one
.
Not
all
fireable
offenses
are
created
equal
.
This
storyline
should
be
familiar
to
us
at
Duke
.
Not
long
ago
,
Larry
Moneta
,
then
the
vice
president
for
student
affairs
,
was
offended
by
the
lyrics
of
a
rap
song
playing
in
Joe
Van
Gogh
.
He
confronted
the
barista
,
who
apologized
profusely
and
changed
the
song
.
Moneta
then
complained
to
the
executive
director
of
dining
services
that
the
employees
of
Joe
Van
Gogh
were
playing
music
that
he
found
quite
inappropriate
for
a
working
environment
and
the
employees
were
told
to
resign
or
be
fired
.
Offended
white
man
fired
black
woman
.
There
is
not
enough
space
to
list
the
recent
instances
of
women
particularly
women
of
color
being
held
to
a
higher
standard
of
politeness
than
men
.
Suffice
it
to
say
that
a
man
walking
down
the
street
without
a
smile
on
his
face
is
just
a
man
walking
down
the
street
.
A
woman
walking
down
the
street
without
a
smile
on
her
face
is
a
target
for
verbal
abuse
and
criticism
.
It’s
as
if
by
simply
existing
she
is
not
polite
or
well
behaved
enough
for
the
rest
of
the
world
.
And
I
am
not
excused
from
this
.
Last
spring
I
had
a
professor
that
I
just
did
not
like
.
I
went
in
for
help
with
a
paper
and
left
her
office
hours
feeling
dumb
and
incapable
and
villainized
her
because
of
that
interaction
.
I
hated
her
class
and
found
excuses
to
hate
it
,
from
her
sloppy
syllabus
loose
leafed
!
No
staples
in
sight
!
to
her
curt
response
when
I
greeted
her
in
the
hallway
.
My
best
friend
,
who
was
also
in
the
class
but
actually
enjoying
it
,
asked
me
in
the
nicest
way
possible
,
Do
you
dislike
her
because
she
is
rude
,
or
do
you
dislike
her
because
she
is
not
as
nice
as
you
think
a
woman
should
be
?
And
of
course
it
was
the
latter
.
She
wasn't
a
malicious
person
,
she
just
wasn't
as
warm
and
personable
as
I
expected
her
to
be
.
If
a
male
professor
had
been
comparatively
neutral
,
I
wouldn't
have
thought
twice
about
it
he
would
have
seemed
aloof
,
but
in
an
erudite
,
scholarly
way
.
Without
realizing
it
,
my
internal
bias
had
turned
me
completely
against
my
professor
based
on
my
subconscious
expectations
of
her
courtesy
.
The
standards
for
politeness
are
simply
not
the
same
for
everyone
.
Straight
,
upper
class
,
white
men
and
often
white
women
are
excused
for
being
dismissive
,
brusque
and
outright
rude
when
people
without
these
privileged
identities
acting
in
the
same
way
face
serious
consequences
.
So
rebels
,
rabble
rousers
and
revolutionaries
are
impolite
because
they
have
to
be
.
Every
day
,
they
are
expected
to
be
disproportionately
well
behaved
and
gracious
.
Every
day
,
when
supervisors
or
coworkers
or
strangers
on
the
street
are
permitted
to
belittle
,
dismiss
and
insult
them
,
society
demands
that
they
take
the
high
road
and
ignore
the
rudeness
without
returning
it
in
kind
.
nbsp
;
Bond’s
understanding
of
politeness
is
narrow
minded
and
stifling
.
Well
behaved
women
and
black
brown
queer
poor
disabled
people
seldom
make
history
because
they
are
required
to
be
well
behaved
at
all
times
it
is
not
an
exception
,
it
is
the
rule
,
the
expectation
that
structures
every
interaction
and
aspect
of
their
lives
.
To
be
listened
to
in
order
to
make
a
change
,
they
have
to
misbehave
.
In
closing
,
Bond
argues
that
to
glorify
defiance
and
vilify
well
mannered
ness
is
to
exacerbate
the
divides
that
already
plague
our
society
.

Where
are
manners
when

I
suppose
it’s
impolite
to
rape
someone
,
but
that’s
not
the
adjective
I
would
choose
to
describe
an
inhumane
,
criminal
act
of
physical
and
emotional
assault
with
traumatic
effects
that
will
far
outlive
the
jail
sentence
of
the
rapist
,
if
there
is
a
jail
sentence
at
all
.
Where
are
manners
when
our
peers
incite
hatred
through
public
messages
of
racism
and
anti
Semitism
?
I
suppose
it’s
impolite
to
scrawl
the
n
word
on
a
sign
at
the
Mary
Lou
or
a
swastika
on
the
East
Campus
Bridge
,
but
that’s
not
how
I
would
write
about
these
blatant
acts
of
hatred
and
terrorism
repeatedly
taking
place
on
our
home
campus
.
Where
are
manners
when
our
peers
.
.
.
feel
forced
to
endure
the
gruesome
rush
process
,
or
even
hazing
?
I
suppose
it’s
impolite
to
haze
someone
,
but
that’s
not
the
first
word
I
would
use
to
describe
violent
harassment
that
reinforces
the
notion
that
subjugating
others
to
your
physical
strength
and
psychological
bullying
is
not
just
acceptable
,
but
encouraged
.
In
explaining
these
events
as
a
reflection
of
a
campus
wide
lack
of
manners
,
Bond
lowers
these
hateful
atrocities
to
the
offense
of
someone
not
holding
the
door
or
unapologetically
leaving
you
on
read
.
For
obvious
reasons
,
these
two
should
not
be
placed
on
the
same
level
,
and
yet
,
that
is
exactly
what
Bond
does
to
justify
her
argument
.
Politeness
is
important
.
Of
course
I
want
to
live
in
a
world
where
people
hold
elevators
and
say
please
and
thank
you
;
of
course
I
want
people
to
be
kind
to
me
,
and
to
others
,
and
to
themselves
.
But
progress
on
issues
like
sexual
assault
,
hate
crimes
and
all
the
other
injustices
that
Bond
names
in
her
case
for
well
behaved
women
does
not
come
from
politeness
.
Progress
comes
from
misbehaving
individuals
.
Just
two
weeks
after
facing
accusations
of
insufficiently
promoting
U
.
S
.
national
security
and
economic
stability
by
Trump’s
Department
of
Education
,
Duke
University
is
hosting
accused
war
criminal
Tzipi
Livni
to
give
a
talk
on
Israel
,
the
United
States
,
amp
;
the
Middle
East
Threats
,
Challenges
and
Opportunities
.
Though
Livni
may
have
some
insight
into
threats
the
Middle
East
,
as
both
a
proponent
and
envoy
of
Israeli
terrorism
,
she
is
wholly
unqualified
to
serve
in
an
educational
capacity
at
any
institution
which
values
diplomacy
over
war
crimes
and
peace
over
apartheid
.
As
Foreign
Minister
of
Israel
and
a
member
of
Prime
Minister
Ehud
Olmert’s
security
cabinet
in
December
of
2008
,
Livni
played
a
key
role
in
the
decisions
made
before
and
during
the
three
week
offensive
known
as
Operation
Cast
Lead
,
which
involved
the
illegal
aerial
bombardment
,
ground
invasion
,
and
naval
blockade
of
the
Gaza
Strip
.
Though
the
exact
extent
of
her
involvement
in
these
crimes
is
unknown
,
according
to
international
law
,
her
high
rank
endowed
her
with
enough
decision
making
capacity
to
render
her
culpable
in
,
at
the
very
least
,
assenting
to
and
being
proud
of
all
decisions
she
made
during
the
operation
.
At
the
time
,
Cast
Lead
was
the
most
devastating
campaign
of
the
60
year
long
Palestinian
occupation
.
The
Israeli
military
killed
almost
1
,
500
people
,
most
of
whom
were
civilians
.
Over
300
of
those
killed
by
Israel
were
children
.
During
the
operation
,
Israeli
forces
directly
targeted
civilian
homes
,
leading
to
the
displacement
of
20
,
000
Gazans
,
as
well
the
destruction
of
infrastructure
,
hospitals
,
schools
and
universities
.
The
United
Nations
,
in
addition
to
several
independent
watchdog
organizations
such
as
Human
Rights
Watch
and
Amnesty
International
,
found
these
acts
constituted
war
crimes
.
Rather
than
distance
herself
from
the
heinous
crimes
of
her
regime
,
Livni
emphatically
supported
the
violence
,
declaring
that
Israel
is
a
country
that
when
you
fire
on
its
citizens
it
responds
by
going
wild
and
this
is
a
good
thing
,
and
proudly
took
credit
,
stating
that
Israel
demonstrated
real
hooliganism
during
the
course
of
the
recent
operation
,
which
I
demanded
.
And
contrary
to
the
claims
of
Livni
and
other
officials
,
the
Israeli
military
,
Hamas
,
broke
the
over
four
month
long
ceasefire
in
November
of
2008
,
fitting
the
usual
pattern
in
which
Israel
virtually
always
fires
first
after
lulls
in
violence
or
ceasefires
lasting
more
than
a
week
.
Tzipi
Livni
herself
said
that
an
extended
truce
harms
the
Israeli
strategic
goal
.
Livni’s
crimes
have
been
cited
on
five
separate
occasions
as
grounds
for
her
arrest
in
Belgium
,
Switzerland
,
and
the
United
Kingdom
.
While
she
was
granted
diplomatic
immunity
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
Livni
evaded
arrest
in
Belgium
by
canceling
her
engagements
.
Though
international
courts
hold
war
criminals
to
be
innocent
until
proven
guilty
,
Livni’s
cowardly
refusal
to
answer
to
her
crimes
in
Belgium
adds
further
confirmation
to
what
is
evidently
clear
Livni
committed
war
crimes
while
serving
on
the
Israeli
war
cabinet
during
Operation
Cast
Lead
.
If
her
crimes
disqualify
her
from
entering
Belgium
without
threat
of
arrest
,
they
should
disqualify
her
from
speaking
at
Duke
without
first
having
to
answer
for
her
crimes
before
a
court
of
law
.
We
certainly
value
the
right
to
free
speech
and
promotion
of
free
expression
here
at
Duke
but
these
principles
are
entirely
irrelevant
to
whether
we
offer
a
podium
to
accused
war
criminals
.
Indeed
,
Livni
is
not
simply
an
ethno
supremacist
pundit
endorsing
Zionist
settler
colonialism
although
that
should
be
enough
to
disqualify
her
from
invitation
to
an
institute
of
higher
learning
;
rather
,
she
is
an
unapologetic
accused
war
criminal
with
blood
on
her
hands
.
Hosting
her
for
a
lecture
minimizes
the
lives
and
deaths
of
her
victims
while
encouraging
future
reproductions
of
her
crimes
.
We
ask
that
all
concerned
members
of
the
Duke
community
,
the
academic
community
and
the
public
stand
in
solidarity
with
the
Palestinian
victims
of
Israeli
war
crimes
and
demand
the
cancellation
of
Livni’s
speech
by
signing
our
petition
and
lending
your
voice
to
the
victims
that
Livni
so
eagerly
and
cruelly
silenced
.
Can
you
say
something
in
your
native
language
?
It’s
actually
just
how
I’m
speaking
to
you
right
now
.
English
is
my
first
language
,
and
Chinese
is
my
second
.
No
,
can
you
say
something
in
your
language
?
my
professor
insisted
.
Like
how
you
would
say
something
to
someone
on
the
streets
in
Singapore
.
People
often
assume
that
just
because
I
have
a
Singaporean
accent
,
I
can’t
possibly
be
a
native
English
speaker
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
many
Singaporeans
,
particularly
millennials
like
me
,
grow
up
speaking
English
as
their
first
language
.
English
was
first
introduced
into
Singapore
under
British
colonization
and
upon
Singapore’s
independence
,
Singapore
adopted
English
as
the
main
language
in
administration
,
education
and
business
.
Singaporeans
own
a
unique
accent
our
intonation
and
the
way
we
stress
syllables
is
distinct
from
British
and
American
dialects
,
with
variations
depending
on
one’s
ethnicity
namely
,
Chinese
,
Malay
,
Indian
or
Eurasian
.
But
what
is
it
about
our
accent
that
makes
it
so
undesirable
,
that
compelled
Crazy
Rich
Asians
a
Hollywood
blockbuster
literally
about
Singaporeans
to
suppress
it
?
An
unconscious
bias
or
cultural
ignorance
?
Despite
my
repeated
explanations
that
English
is
my
first
language
,
my
professor
kept
probing
for
a
different
answer
.
I
sighed
,
and
simply
out
of
frustration
,
I
muttered
some
rudimentary
Chinese
,
just
to
satisfy
her
.
I
regularly
witness
this
linguistic
othering
at
Duke
and
in
the
US
.
There
are
accents
that
carry
certain
privileges
,
like
a
perception
of
class
or
education
,
and
then
there
are
accents
that
are
linked
with
foreignness
.
It
is
all
the
more
disappointing
when
my
professor
at
Duke
makes
me
feel
that
my
accent
is
too
foreign
and
consequently
,
less
than
ideal
.
As
你好吗
?
,
the
most
basic
greeting
in
Chinese
,
left
my
lips
,
I
already
felt
regret
.
Why
did
I
cave
in
,
instead
of
holding
my
ground
?
It
takes
courage
to
express
ourselves
fully
and
truly
,
to
preserve
our
accent
despite
our
marginalized
voices
.
It
also
takes
courage
to
actively
westernize
one’s
accent
in
order
to
thoroughly
fit
into
American
society
.
Day
in
and
day
out
,
I
find
myself
vacillating
between
embracing
my
Singaporean
accent
to
express
myself
the
way
I
am
,
and
conveniently
adopting
a
twang
or
two
to
sound
like
my
American
peers
.
My
accent
is
undeniably
an
innate
part
of
who
I
am
.
My
accent
carries
the
rhythm
of
my
national
anthem
,
the
heartbeat
of
a
five
million
strong
nation
,
Singapore’s
diverse
ethnicities
and
cultures
,
and
yet
,
the
commonality
of
being
Singaporean
.
I
embrace
the
staccato
beat
of
my
accent
proudly
during
conversations
with
friends
and
at
job
interviews
,
on
this
American
soil
that
is
ten
thousand
miles
away
from
home
.
On
unfamiliar
and
foreign
land
,
the
Singaporean
accent
is
like
music
to
my
ears
,
a
love
song
from
home
.
When
Singapore's
ambassador
to
the
US
Ashok
Mirpuri
visited
Duke
earlier
this
year
,
he
expressed
his
hope
that
no
matter
where
Singaporeans
reside
on
this
planet
,
they
would
always
feel
a
tie
back
to
home
.
That’s
the
power
of
the
Singaporean
accent
wherever
I
go
,
I
can
almost
instantly
identify
the
Singaporean
accent
in
a
sea
of
people
.
Every
time
I
hang
out
with
Singaporeans
here
at
Duke
,
I
feel
comforted
in
a
home
away
from
home
,
basking
in
the
melody
of
the
Singaporean
accent
.
And
it
really
hits
home
for
me
when
the
Singaporean
accent
resounds
on
the
global
stage
.
The
moment
Kenneth
Sng
delivered
the
Opening
Speech
at
the
2016
US
Presidential
Debate
as
the
Student
Union
president
of
Washington
University
in
St
.
Louis
,
his
Singaporean
cadence
reverberated
throughout
national
television
,
enthusing
me
and
other
Singaporeans
all
over
the
world
.
During
my
internship
in
Seattle
this
past
summer
,
I
was
energized
by
a
Singaporean
colleague
who
always
spoke
confidently
with
the
richest
Singaporean
accent
despite
having
been
in
the
US
for
twelve
years
.
Here
we
are
Singaporeans
,
being
heard
loud
and
proud
,
in
the
United
States
of
America

Just
as
the
distinct
accents
of
the
Irish
,
Scottish
,
New
Yorkers
and
Southerners
each
have
their
own
story
,
so
too
does
my
Singaporean
accent
.
Instead
of
judging
me
by
my
accent
,
be
open
,
listen
to
my
story
and
hear
me
out
you’ll
find
that
we
actually
speak
the
same
language
.
The
stereotypes
and
aesthetic
associated
with
leftist
activists
especially
liberal
men
are
annoying
,
low
hanging
fruit
,
but
are
not
entirely
out
of
touch
with
reality
Cucks
.
Snowflakes
.
Betas
.
The
list
goes
on
.
It
is
incredibly
hard
to
be
articulate
and
precise
on
this
issue
,
but
you
know
what
I
mean
.
The
left
has
a
perception
problem
that
it’s
not
willing
to
admit
.
Although
this
topic
seems
ridiculous
,
it’s
undeniable
that
these
representations
whether
or
not
we
may
exercise
significant
control
of
them
turn
off
many
moderates
and
uninvolved
political
participants
from
the
left
.
Our
insistence
on
politicking
to
signal
virtue
and
the
manner
by
which
we
self
righteously
and
often
hypocritically
conduct
ourselves
shape
these
representations
and
certainly
hold
us
back
.
Although
one
can
take
the
moral
high
ground
and
want
to
believe
that
we
don’t
want
those
votes
anyways
,
the
reality
of
the
situation
is
that
the
status
quo
is
a
hellscape
for
vulnerable
populations
and
Democrats
need
to
come
into
2020
swinging
.
That
means
establishing
themselves
as
confident
,
assertive
,
yet
uncompromisingly
progressive
.
We
desperately
need
a
makeover
in
2020
,
but
I’m
not
exactly
sure
what
that
process
looks
like
and
whether
it
can
ever
be
an
ethical
prescription
.
But
I
do
know
that
I’m
tired
of
supporting
a
movement
that
unequivocally
defends
the
belief
that
when
they
go
low
,
we
go
high
.
I’m
tired
of
insisting
upon
the
innocence
of
corrupted
institutions
when
the
current
state
of
affairs
empowers
deceit
,
outrage
and
spectacle
in
politics
.
We
restrain
ourselves
,
attempt
to
understand
the
other
and
ultimately
forgive
instead
of
seriously
confronting
them
on
Twitter
or
cable
news
and
hardly
attempt
to
change
the
rules
of
engagement
entirely
.
Democrats
need
to
play
to
win
because
anything
else
condemns
us
to
the
status
quo
a
pitiful
,
whiny
existence
that
always
seems
to
place
us
on
the
losing
side
of
political
scandal
.
I’m
not
arguing
that
we
should
collude
with
foreign
governments
to
improve
our
representations
,
but
simply
to
critically
think
about
perception
and
to
refuse
to
be
a
group
of
pushovers
.
People
are
counting
on
the
left
in
2020
and
I’m
ready
to
engage
in
some
McConnell
level
tactical
maneuvering
and
scheming
if
that’s
what
it
takes
to
deliver
.
45
was
rewarded
with
the
presidency
for
his
vulgarity
.
I
don’t
think
that
the
left
or
even
the
country
as
a
whole
wants
to
see
us
fix
that
by
showing
compassion
.
I’m
tired
of
a
liberal
politics
obsessed
with
being
virtuous
and
ultimately
boring
in
the
name
of
not
offending
those
with
disagreements
.
The
current
political
sphere
is
anything
but
business
as
usual
and
it’s
entirely
unconvincing
to
respond
by
suppressing
our
natural
human
emotions
.
For
instance
,
Beto’s
raw
speech
about
Trump’s
comments
on
the
El
Paso
shooting
was
a
huge
turn
on
for
voters
and
is
probably
the
only
thing
keeping
him
alive
at
this
point
;
dropping
f
bombs
won’t
necessarily
win
us
seats
,
but
I
think
it’s
safe
to
say
voters
minimally
want
their
politicians
to
be
authentic
and
thus
outraged
.
Moreover
,
the
right
has
successfully
branded
itself
as
the
party
of
sexy
big
businesses
and
independent
thinkers
fixated
on
telling
the
truth
when
blue
pilled
liberals
can’t
step
outside
of
their
fantasy
land
.
Internet
trolls
and
conservative
influencers
poke
fun
at
the
liberal
participation
trophy
culture
,
safe
spaces
from
outside
criticism
,
and
our
obsession
with
losing
often
,
but
at
least
ethically
.
And
quite
honestly
,
these
strategies
work
really
well
.
I
feel
a
strong
,
internal
embarrassment
,
for
instance
,
when
thinking
about
Democratic
candidates
pandering
to
people
of
color
,
Portland
Antifa
dressing
up
as
bananas
,
and
Hillary
desperately
pleading
for
us
to
Pokemon
Go
to
the
polls
.
Voters
can
easily
sense
who’s
being
real
and
who’s
trying
way
too
hard
to
take
the
moral
high
ground
by
being
woke
.
It’s
hard
to
point
to
specific
examples
,
but
the
method
by
which
so
many
on
the
left
self
righteously
conduct
themselves
,
particularly
on
the
internet
to
appeal
to
young
voters
,
is
blatantly
cringe
worthy
.
However
,
this
issue
with
the
left’s
representations
doesn’t
stem
from
its
core
values
of
compassion
or
empathy
.
The
basic
tenet
of
empathy
is
not
mutually
exclusive
with
being
inspiring
and
assertive
.
The
fight
for
emancipatory
politics
can
and
should
be
made
sexy
through
a
deliberate
refocusing
from
issues
like
political
correctness
to
energizing
struggles
against
unjust
authority
and
political
elites
.
Groups
like
Black
Lives
Matter
and
policies
like
Medicare
for
All
or
the
Green
New
Deal
,
for
instance
,
are
certainly
controversial
but
definitely
not
cringy
.
In
fact
,
the
right
often
plays
to
romanticized
and
nostalgic
narratives
about
police
officers
,
veterans
,
blue
collar
workers
and
natural
disaster
survivors
to
garner
sympathy
and
compassion
just
as
often
.
The
relevant
difference
is
certainly
an
issue
of
our
energy
and
framing
.

On
the
internet
,
the
logic
of
cancel
culture
,
the
focus
on
microaggressions
,
and
the
Ellen
amp
;
Bush
debacle
are
all
excellent
examples
of
how
liberals
empower
an
unconscious
system
of
desire
that
ultimately
restrains
leftist
politics
and
empowers
Donald
Trump
.
The
right
finds
immense
pleasure
in
name
calling
because
it
ruptures
and
trolls
the
social
authority
that
out
of
touch
liberals
have
mandated
.
In
this
sense
,
there
exists
a
masochistic
structure
of
enjoyment
.
Knowing
that
Trump
is
bad
for
people
is
not
enough
to
lessen
the
enjoyment
of
his
regime
and
realizing
oneself
as
problematic
is
irrelevant
when
the
right
offers
a
more
appealing
method
of
living
;
for
many
,
it
almost
seems
impossible
to
imagine
liberals
having
fun
without
constantly
talking
about
how
ethical
they
are
.
Liberals
will
argue
that
they
are
nevertheless
on
the
right
side
of
the
issue
and
that
they
claim
a
truer
vision
of
politics
but
such
concerns
are
at
best
merely
tangential
for
those
not
already
sold
on
the
left
.
We
can’t
control
what
the
right
calls
us
,
but
we
can
certainly
alter
the
behaviors
that
enable
such
stereotypes
.
My
vision
is
not
a
shift
away
from
our
current
policy
stances
,
but
rather
a
refusal
to
solely
rely
on
seeming
trendy
and
virtuous
.
Those
tangibly
affected
by
the
enactment
of
progressive
policies
don’t
care
about
our
perceived
moral
high
ground
,
or
at
least
not
enough
to
choose
being
ethical
over
a
leftism
that
is
fed
up
and
willing
to
do
what
it
takes
to
win
back
the
White
House
and
Senate
.
Within
the
US
,
health
insurance
coverage
of
abortion
can
be
a
sticky
topic
.
Within
universities
in
the
US
and
their
respective
student
health
insurance
plans
,
it
can
be
even
stickier
.
And
that
is
precisely
why
I
set
out
to
investigate
the
reality
of
this
situation
here
at
Duke
.
If
a
woman
student
looking
to
terminate
her
pregnancy
needed
more
information
about
abortion
coverage
,
where
would
she
go
?
The
first
place
I
went
,
of
course
,
was
to
the
Student
Health
Website
.
After
going
through
the
tabs
of
Student
Health
Insurance
,
I
found
there
,
within
the
fine
print
of
the
member
guide
,
the
benefits
of
abortion
coverage
.
Although
I
noted
that
abortion
coverage
was
not
mentioned
in
either
the
summary
of
the
medical
benefits
on
the
Student
Blue
page
or
the
SMIP
cheat
sheet
,
the
documents
that
people
look
at
when
they’re
looking
into
the
SMIP
as
their
health
insurance
plan
for
the
next
four
years
,
it
was
there
.
Benefits
for
abortion
for
Duke
students
are
available
for
the
first
16
weeks
of
the
pregnancy
.
However
,
I
still
had
many
more
questions
about
the
nature
of
this
coverage
and
so
I
decided
to
take
further
measures
to
find
out
the
answers
to
my
relatively
simple
questions
about
billing
,
cost
of
the
package
,
etc
.
Within
this
process
,
however
,
I
encountered
a
surprising
lack
of
knowledge
,
lack
of
transparency
,
or
a
simple
lack
of
communication
that
made
me
question
the
access
of
information
that
students
really
have
about
their
insurance
plans
,
specifically
abortion
.
First
,
to
answer
these
questions
,
I
logically
decided
to
email
the
insurance
department
and
the
insurance
coordinator
.
After
one
email
and
two
callbacks
later
from
the
insurance
coordinator
,
I
finally
reached
him
only
to
be
told
that
my
request
for
information
about
insurance
coverage
had
to
pass
through
upper
management
.
Frustrated
and
on
a
deadline
,
I
called
the
insurance
company
,
Blue
Cross
Blue
Shield
.
Once
I
called
Blue
Cross
Blue
Shield
,
I
was
able
to
speak
with
a
representative
,
who
although
very
nice
,
was
not
helpful
.
He
informed
me
other
universities
directly
offer
different
plans
that
either
provide
or
don’t
provide
coverage
of
abortion
,
and
students
are
able
to
choose
their
own
plan
.
However
,
because
students
at
Duke
enroll
through
our
DukeHub
account
,
Blue
Cross
Blue
Shield
was
not
able
to
view
the
specific
coverage
of
our
plan
and
not
able
to
answer
the
questions
I
had
relating
to
this
coverage
.
I
also
contacted
a
representative
from
the
Women’s
Center
,
specifying
my
interest
in
abortion
coverage
under
the
SMIP
and
the
path
that
women
would
follow
at
Duke
if
they
wanted
to
have
an
abortion
.
To
my
disappointment
,
she
responded
saying
that
this
was
not
her
specialty
and
that
I
should
refer
back
to
the
insurance
department
.
Given
the
fact
that
abortion
is
such
a
prevalent
and
important
issue
for
women
,
I
was
surprised
that
I
was
not
referred
to
anyone
within
the
Women’s
Center
who
had
information
regarding
this
reproductive
right
.
This
presumed
lack
of
knowledge
made
me
question
how
well
known
abortion
coverage
was
known
to
even
professionals
around
campus
.
After
contacting
the
Duke
Clinic
,
the
hospital
,
and
going
to
the
Student
Wellness
Center
to
no
avail
,
I
finally
received
an
email
back
from
Calvin
Beacham
,
from
the
insurance
department
,
who
seemed
to
be
one
of
the
only
people
on
campus
able
to
answer
my
questions
about
abortion
coverage
.
After
this
wild
goose
chase
for
information
,
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
on
campus
,
abortion
coverage
under
the
SMIP
is
not
a
topic
that
is
well
known
,
well
investigated
,
or
well
publicized
.
And
this
is
a
problem
.
The
reality
is
that
in
America
,
the
rates
of
abortion
among
college
students
are
predicted
to
be
high
.
Even
if
Duke
may
not
experience
high
rates
of
abortion
under
the
SMIP
,
this
issue
is
one
that
is
relevant
for
at
least
half
the
population
of
students
and
should
be
publicized
more
.
The
lack
of
knowledge
among
students
and
staff
may
stem
from
the
fact
that
abortion
coverage
is
not
mentioned
in
either
the
cheat
sheet
or
the
summary
of
the
medical
benefits
provided
on
the
Student
Health
Website
.
Regardless
if
abortion
is
covered
under
the
SMIP
or
not
,
in
an
insurance
package
that
is
purchased
so
widely
by
the
student
body
and
with
an
issue
as
controversial
and
important
,
it
needs
to
be
published
in
bigger
font
than
size
8
on
an
83
page
document
.
I
am
not
trying
to
spout
my
views
on
abortion
in
this
column
;
I
am
only
saying
that
the
gravity
of
this
topic
,
regardless
of
how
often
it
is
actually
utilized
under
the
insurance
plan
,
means
that
it
deserves
greater
significance
than
it
currently
has
.
In
as
sexually
active
of
a
population
as
college
students
,
knowledge
about
the
availability
and
access
to
abortion
is
something
that
deserves
more
than
just
the
fine
print
and
should
be
known
by
more
than
just
one
person
on
campus
.
We
appreciate
the
recent
statement
on
academic
freedom
from
President
Price
and
Provost
Kornbluth
following
the
US
Department
of
Education’s
investigation
of
the
Duke
UNC
Consortium
for
Middle
East
studies
.
We
also
welcome
the
letter
to
the
DOE
from
18
American
academic
associations
including
the
Middle
East
Studies
Association
,
the
Modern
Language
Association
,
and
the
American
Anthropological
Association
who
characterized
the
investigation
as
an
unprecedented
and
counterproductive
intervention
into
academic
curricula
and
programming
that
threatens
the
integrity
and
autonomy
of
our
country’s
institutions
of
higher
education
.
The
Federal
investigation
is
the
culmination
of
a
decades
long
campaign
by
anti
Palestinian
organizations
against
academic
programing
and
curricular
offerings
that
are
deemed
insufficiently
pro
Israel
.
This
investigation
targeted
a
Middle
East
center
,
but
should
concern
all
of
us
.
Today
,
all
teachers
and
scholars
are
at
risk
when
not
aligned
with
national
policy
and
national
security
priorities
.
At
stake
,
in
the
current
moment
,
is
the
ability
of
Universities
to
operate
freely
and
openly
without
the
fear
of
censure
,
and
the
ability
of
faculty
to
determine
what
they
teach
,
how
they
teach
it
,
what
they
choose
to
research
or
write
about
,
or
who
can
speak
on
our
campus
.
Duke’s
continued
commitment
to
open
debate
is
vital
.
The
integrity
of
our
University
demands
an
educational
climate
where
free
and
open
inquiry
is
encouraged
and
fostered
,
in
and
out
of
the
classroom
,
even
on
the
most
controversial
subjects
.
Signed
,
Some
investments
are
quite
profitable
,
Dr
.
Lawrence
Baxter
,
Duke
Law
professor
and
chairman
of
Duke’s
Advisory
Committee
on
Investment
Responsibility
ACIR
,
stated
at
ACIR’s
2019
fall
forum
,
even
though
they
are
borderline
uncomfortable
for
us
.
ACIR
recently
rejected
for
the
second
time
in
five
years
student
demands
that
Duke
divest
from
its
fossil
fuel
investments
.
This
decision
is
an
affront
to
the
values
Duke
claims
to
prioritize
.
Confidentiality
prevents
members
of
the
ACIR
,
which
reports
to
President
Price
and
the
Board
of
Trustees
on
social
responsibility
in
Duke
University’s
endowment
,
from
discussing
specific
endowment
holdings
,
but
Baxter
cited
British
Petroleum
BP
as
an
example
of
an
energy
firm
Duke
might
support
,
given
its
investment
in
renewables
.
I
may
be
too
young
to
drink
or
rent
a
car
,
but
I
remember
2010
,
when
BP’s
negligence
caused
the
disaster
,
the
largest
marine
oil
spill
in
history
and
an
entirely
preventable
catastrophe
.
In
the
years
since
this
incident
,
since
a
2006
Alaskan
oil
spill
and
a
2005
Texas
refinery
explosion
which
killed
15
workers
,
BP
has
launched
a
remarkably
successful
campaign
to
convince
the
public
that
it
is
transitioning
in
good
faith
from
fossil
fuels
to
renewable
energy
.
Last
year
,
BP’s
CEO
told
Reuters
that
,
of
its
15
to
17
billion
operating
budget
,
just
500
million
contributes
to
renewables
.
Generously
calculated
,
that’s
about
three
percent
.
Baxter
,
Senior
Vice
President
Richard
Riddell
and
Anil
Madhok
,
COO
of
DUMAC
,
the
firm
which
invests
Duke’s
endowment
,
took
care
to
emphasize
that
Duke
directs
a
slim
percentage
of
its
assets
towards
fossil
fuel
related
activities
.
Maybe
30
million
,
Madhok
estimated
.
The
adults
in
the
room
seemed
insensible
to
how
ridiculous
this
number
the
full
cost
of
four
years’
Duke
tuition
,
fees
and
room
and
board
for
over
100
students
sounded
.
If
Duke’s
fossil
fuel
investments
are
as
insignificant
as
Madhok
claims
,
what
is
the
stumbling
block
preventing
their
removal
?
The
ACIR
in
2014
and
2019
politely
declined
proposals
from
Divest
Duke
and
Duke
Climate
Coalition
DCC
,
which
absorbed
Divest
Duke
,
to
divest
from
its
holdings
in
fossil
fuels
.
Baxter
explained
that
Duke
has
more
financial
skin
in
the
game
than
other
universities
which
have
met
student
divestment
demands
,
also
commenting
that
symbolic
divestment
may
restrict
debate
or
obstruct
the
issue’s
complexity
.
I
am
a
current
DCC
member
,
but
my
opinions
are
purely
my
own
.
Divestment
would
be
enormously
meaningful
from
Duke
precisely
because
it
requires
financial
sacrifice
.
Duke
divested
previously
from
conflict
minerals
and
products
of
apartheid
South
Africa
over
concerns
about
the
violence
their
manufacture
implicated
,
but
where
is
this
pacifism
when
it
comes
to
the
millions
of
refugees
that
climate
crisis
will
produce
by
midcentury
?
If
we
only
live
our
values
when
the
decisions
we
face
are
easy
and
the
financial
trade
offs
slight
,
are
they
even
our
values
at
all
?
Defending
Duke’s
policy
,
ACIR
members
cited
campus
sustainability
campaigns
,
an
area
of
demonstrated
strength
.
Duke
has
long
been
pursuing
a
2024
carbon
neutrality
goal
,
and
a
2019
update
to
the
university
Climate
Action
Plan
CAP
reports
that
,
given
investments
in
energy
efficiency
and
an
eastern
NC
carbon
farm
,
Duke’s
net
emissions
are
on
track
to
fall
78
from
2009
levels
.
It’s
not
a
perfect
victory
,
however
,
especially
given
that
Duke
will
recoup
its
remaining
22
of
emissions
using
carbon
offsets
investments
in
renewable
energy
which
,
though
laudable
,
decouple
environmental
restoration
projects
from
the
sites
where
emissions
occur
.
The
CAP
also
fails
to
account
for
emissions
through
the
Duke
Health
system
.
Most
troublingly
,
the
2019
CAP
update
affirms
that
Duke
receives
nearly
all
of
its
electricity
needs
from
Duke
Energy
,
a

history
.
Like
BP
,
Duke
Energy
poses
as
a
renewables
champion
but
has
actively
subverted
the
expansion
of
clean
energy
throughout
its
territory
.
State
law
enshrines
the
University
environmental
criminal
relationship
by
barring
electricity
purchases
from
any
other
source
,
leaving
Duke
in
an
unenviable
position
though
the
CAP
does
note
and
plan
Duke’s
potential
to
introduce
renewables
on
campus
.
But
our
entanglement
with
Duke
Energy
reaches
deeper
than
simple
finances
at
least
one
DUMAC
liaison
has
worked
for
Duke
Energy
.
During
this
week’s
forum
,
ACIR
announced
its
proposal
to
leverage
Duke’s
stakeholder
power
for
clean
energy
advocacy
.
We
must
not
allow
crony
relationships
to
hold
back
this
plan
,
which
could
be
transformative
if
fiercely
pursued

As
I
come
of
age
during
this
terrifying
time
,
I
need
my
university
to
be
a
voice
of
moral
clarity
.
Duke
must
divest
from
fossil
fuels
the
choice
to
do
so
would
be
both
symbolic

significant
.
Duke
must
hold
Duke

postcolonial
theorist
Dipesh
Chakrabarty
has
written
,
our
mansion
of
.
freedoms
stands
on
an
ever
expanding
base
of
fossil
fuel
use
,
Duke
has
a
responsibility
to
help
us
dream
differently
.
This
University’s
mission
statement
trumpets
our
real
leadership
in
all
we
do
,
but
if
we
tackle
our
ensnarement
in
fossil
combustion
gradually
,
rather
than
reexamining
our
fundamental
modes
of
being
,
there
will
be
nothing
left
to
lead
.
Duke
can
start
by
adding
an
undergraduate
environmental
history
graduation
requirement
,
investing
in
community
resilience
practices
for
the
century
ahead
,
and
shining
an
unflinching
light
on
how
climate
crisis
will
impact
every
department
at
this
university
and
every
facet
of
our
lives
.
So
as
climate
crisis
chokes
off
our
food
supply
,
endangers
the
most
vulnerable
and
lowest
emitting
populations
,
and
sets
fire
to
our
world
,
which
history
is
Duke
writing
?
Will
our
descendants
remember
us
for
acting
morally
in
the
age
of
paralysis
,
or
will
our
choices
continue
to
poison
us
all
?
I
usually
try
to
stay
away
from
the
Chronicle’s
editorial
section
,
as
I
get
more
than
my
fair
share
of
heated
debate
via
Facebook
.
However
,
as
I
thought
about
those
who
had
been
jilted
or
pushed
away
from
the
Church
by
a
similar
kind
of
wrong
headed
,
prideful
,
infallible
mentality
,
I
decided
that
I
could
not
let
what
was
said
in
Reiss
Becker’s
critique
of
Sophie
Laettner’s
article
be
the
last
word
on
the
issue
.
nbsp
;
If
the
Church
is
not
calling
out
White
Supremacy
at
every
possible
opportunity
,
then
the
Church
has
failed
to
be
the
Church
.
nbsp
;
Jesus
himself
told
us
to
love
our
neighbors
as
ourselves
that’s
our
entire
job
description
as
Christians
when
it
comes
to
interpersonal
relationships
.
nbsp
;
Any
pastor
who
is
somehow
unable
to
equate
white
supremacist
violence
with
doing
harm
to
one’s
neighbor
might
want
to
go
back
to
divinity
school
,
and
perhaps
kindergarden
while
they’re
at
it
.
nbsp
;
It
is
the
solemn
duty
of
any
person
of
the
cloth
to
condemn
any
and
all
acts
of
malice
against
God’s
creation
.
Point
blank
,
period
.
nbsp
;
As
for
white
supremacy
and
the
Christian
Church
in
the
West
,
this
may
come
as
a
shock
,
but
we
are
so
afflicted
with
white
supremacy
,
we
can’t
even
seem
to
come
to
terms
with
the
fact
that
the
guy
that
we
worship
the
Middle
Eastern
born
Jew
probably
didn’t
have
fair
skin
,
dirty
blonde
to
brown
hair
,
and
blue
eyes
.
In
the
mid
20th
century
,
Dr
.
King
said
the
most
segregated
hour
in
America
is
11
00
a
.
m
.
to
noon
on
Sunday
morning
.
nbsp
;
Here
we
are
a
quarter
of
the
way
through
the
21st
,
not
doing
too
well
on
that
front
either
,
are
we
?
nbsp
;
Not
to
mention
the
fact
that
all
but
the
very
first
nbsp
;
iteration
of
the
Ku
Klux
Klan
has
been
founded
and
heavily
marketed
as
an
exclusively
Christian
organization
.
I
agree
with
Reiss
when
he
states
that
many
of
the
strongest
Christian
traditions
in
our
country
today
are
found
in
our
black
and
brown
communities
.
In
spite
of
,
and
often
in
response
to
white
supremacy
in
the
Church
,
these
houses
of
worship
have
become
places
where
the
love
and
Prevenient
Grace
of
Jesus
Christ
has
fostered
generations
of
care
,
nurturing
,
community
,
belonging
and
prosperity
in
the
face
of
endless
adversity
.
nbsp
;
These
communities
have
flourished
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
many
cases
,
the
ideology
on
which
they
were
initially
founded
was
the
twisted
and
mangled
version
of
scripture
promulgated
by
the
slave
masters
of
early
America
.
nbsp
;
What
could
be
more
perverse
and
wrong
than
to
knowingly
misrepresent
the
words
of
our
Lord
for
the
explicit
purpose
of
prolonging
the
subjugation
of
a
whole
class
of
people
,
simply
based
on
your
own
backwards
beliefs
that
your
skin
color
affords
you
more
of
a
claim
to
freedom
and
equality
in
life
?
nbsp
;
Nevertheless
,
in
spite
of
the
wolves
of
white
supremacy
barking
at
the
door
,
communities
like
Emanuel
AME
Church
the
entire
AME
and
AMEZ
denominations
existing
in
the
first
place
because
white
methodists
insisted
on
segregating
sanctuaries
became
such
bastions
of
the
mighty
love
of
Jesus
that
when
a
white
supremacist
terrorist
entered
their
place
of
Christian
worship
,
gunned
down
their
leaders
and
cursed
their
culture
,
Mother
Emanuel
vehemently
rejected
her
every
right
to
rise
up
in
anger
,
and
instead
showed
us
all
that
indeed
,
when
through
many
dangers
,
toils
and
snares
we
have
already
come
,
it
is
the
Amazing
Grace
of
Jesus
that
will
lead
us
home
.
nbsp
;
When
God
is
with
us
,
even
bullets
can’t
tear
us
down
.
nbsp

nbsp
;
The
author’s
fixation
on
the
technicalities
of
Ms
.
Laettner’s
letter
betray
a
deeper
insecurity
regarding
the
real
claims
made
therein
.
nbsp
;
Why
do
we
need
a
comprehensive
chart
of
the
modern
day
denominational
delineations
of
the
Church
?
nbsp
;
She
said
the
Christian
Church
,
and
I
take
that
to
mean
any
church
that
claims
to
follow
the
teachings
of
Jesus
,
the
Son
of
God
.
Denominations
may
vary
.
nbsp
;
Most
importantly
,
she
didn’t
seek
to
disparage
our
faith
in
the
least
;
instead
,
she
sought
out
the
help
of
the
most
collectively
foundational
organization
in
the
history
of
mankind
in
addressing
a
growing
problem
in
our
country
.
nbsp
;
Just
because
a
shooter
doesn’t
mention
any
Christian
buzzwords
in
their
manifesto
,
doesn’t
mean
we
as
Christians
didn’t
have
some
small
part
in
driving
them
to
that
point
,
and
it
suren’t
doesn’t
excuse
us
from
our
duty
in
working
to
prevent
the
next
such
attack
.
nbsp
;
To
Sophie
,
I
appreciate
your
letter
,
and
I
personally
commit
to
doing
all
in
my
power
as
a
Christian
and
a
United
Methodist
to
defeat
White
Supremacy
.
nbsp
;
To
anybody
reading
this
who
isn’t
too
sure
about
the
Church
or
the
Christians
in
it
,
I
understand
,
but
know
that
we
are
doing
our
best
to
be
better
.
The
Church
at
its
worst
is
hostile
to
self
reflection
,
and
the
Church
at
its
best
is
constantly
changing
in
the
name
of
Jesus
to
meet
the
unique
needs
of
the
world
.
nbsp
;
We’re
greatly
flawed
,
but
we’re
not
defeated
,
not
even
close
.
Fixing
this
world
is
going
to
take
everyone
Jews
,
Muslims
,
Hindus
,
Buddhists
,
Sikhs
,
Agnostics
,
Atheists
,
and
a
Christian
Church
committed
to
being
the
best
version
of
itself
that
it
can
be
,
whatever
that
takes
.
nbsp
;
When
you
look
at
it
that
way
,
those
same
problems
don’t
look
quite
as
insurmountable
after
all
.
nbsp
;
Tragic
,
jarring
and
disturbing
,
mass
shootings
have
become
a
fixture
of
American
politics
.
Mass
shooters
have
targeted
our
houses
of
worship
,
our
schools
,
our
workplaces
,
our
stores
and
our
communities
.
Unfortunately
,
in
the
wake
of
these
attacks
,
the
last
casualty
is
always
our
ability
to
reason
.
It
is
understandable
that
these
shootings
provoke
rage
and
reaction
,
confusion
and
finger
pointing
.
nbsp
;
But
while
such
responses
are
understandable
,
they
are
not
acceptable
.
Which
is
why
I
could
not
let
Sophie
Laettner’s
latest
column
stand
unchallenged
.
Her
assumptions
are
objectionable
.
Her
logic
is
questionable
.
Her
conclusions
are
unacceptable
.
Entitled
It
is
time
for
the
Christian
church
to
respond
to
Christianist
violence
in
America
,
her
column
responds
to
recent
bouts
of
white
supremacist
violence
,
specifically
the
Christchurch
mosque
shooting
in
New
Zealand
and
the
Walmart
shooting
in
El
Paso
.
After
referencing
an
Atlantic
article
and
summarizing
the
content
of
Dean
Wilson’s
American
Dreams
,
American
Realities
class
,
Laettner
makes
a
logical
leap
that
could
span
the
Grand
Canyon
.
She
writes
as
it
relates
to
gun
violence
in
connection
to
white
supremacy
,
which
is
ideologically
linked
to
Christianity
.
.
.
This
is
slander
.
Laettner
has
not
proven
an
ideological
connection
between
white
supremacy
and
Christianity
.
Neither
the
Atlantic
article
nor
the
summary
of
her
course
material
establish
this
connection
definitively
.
The
Atlantic
article
documents
that
many
Americans
have
demanded
faith
leaders
respond
to
white
supremacist
violence
,
but
also
notes
that
many
Christian
pastors
have
argued
that
they
have
no
special
obligation
to
respond
to
these
events
.
Far
from
supporting
Laettner’s
conclusion
,
the
article
simply
summarizes
an
ongoing
and
inconclusive
debate
.
Somehow
,
Laettner
has
snatched
certainty
from
the
jaws
of
ambiguity
.
Judging
from
Laettner’s
summary
of
his
views
and
course
content
,
Dean
Wilson
does
not
personally
or
academically
claim
that
Christianity
is
ideologically
linked
to
white
supremacy
.
The
closest
Laettner
gets
to
supporting
this
claim
based
on
his
observations
is
when
she
separately
references
the
city
on
a
hill
myth
which
she
claims
has
roots
in
Christianity
,
capitalism
and
democracy
and
the
KKK’s
belief
in
regenerative
violence
.
If
Laettner
demonstrated
a
connection
between
these
ideas
then
she
would
have
provided
some
support
for
her
claim
.
Instead
,
she
leaves
her
freestanding
points
of
evidence
unsupported
by
binding
analysis
.
I
hope
Chronicle
readers
are
good
at
playing
Connect
the
Dots
.
Moreover
,
I
wonder
whether
Laettner
read
the
manifestos
of
the
two
shooters
she
mentions
.
The
Christchurch
shooter
explicitly
refrains
from
claiming
that
he
is
a
Christian
in
his
manifesto
,
and
instead
expresses
ambivalence
on
the
matter
of
his
religion
.
The
manifesto
of
the
El
Paso
shooter
makes
no
mention
of
Christianity
or
any
faith
as
a
motivation
.
Why
is
the
Christian
Church
morally
obligated
to
respond
to
the
acts
of
two
white
supremacists
who
do
not
claim
to
be
Christians
?
Another
issue
Laettner
asks
where
is
the
response
from
the
Christian
majority
and
the
Christian
church
?
Why
is
there
a
lack
of
response
?
Let’s
unpack
this
question
.
What
is
the
Christian
Church
that
Laettner
calls
upon
?
Does
Laettner
mean
the
Roman
Catholic
Church
?
Or
the
Eastern
Orthodox
Church
?
Or
the
Episcopal
Church
?
Or
the
Baptist
Church
?
The
last
time
the
term
Christian
Church
had
any
practical
meaning
was
in
1053
A
.
D
.
That
was
in
the
Middle
Ages
,
prior
to
the
Great
Schism
of
1054
A
.
D
.
that
split
the
Eastern
Orthodox
Church
from
the
Catholic
Church
.
Modern
Christians
,
particularly
in
the
United
States
,
are
incredibly
diverse
and
numerous
.
They
do
not
belong
to
a
universal
Christian
Church
and
to
assert
otherwise
is
both
ahistorical
and
trivializing
of
the
theological
differences
that
separate
Christian
denominations
.
To
be
fair
,
many
Christians
from
all
sects
might
argue
that
their
personal
church
should
become
the
one
universal
Christian
Church
,
but
they
would
never
concede
that
a
universal
Christian
Church
exists
currently
.
In
light
of
this
,
the
answer
to
Laettner’s
question
,
Why
is
there
a
lack
of
response
?
is
simple
.
Organizations
that
do
not
exist
do
not
issue
responses
.
Some
may
think
I
am
nitpicking
on
this
point
.
I
am
not
.
Words
have
meaning
,
precision
in
writing
is
important
and
Laettner’s
intentions
should
be
as
accurately
reflected
in
her
diction
as
possible
.
Doing
otherwise
only
serves
to
muddy
her
argument
and
confuse
her
readers
.
However
,
for
the
sake
of
argument
,
even
if
I
assume
the
existence
of
a
Christian
Church
,
I
still
do
not
think
Laettner
has
done
the
analytical
work
sufficient
to
prove
an
ideological
link
between
white
supremacy
and
Christianity
.
Even
if
the
Christian
Church
did
exist
,
it
would
not
be
obligated
to
respond
to
Laettner’s
argument
!
I
have
harshly
criticized
her
column
,
but
I
believe
Laettner
is
coming
from
a
good
place
.
Although
her
argument
is
fundamentally
flawed
,
I
can
tell
from
her
concerned
tone
that
she
truly
did
not
believe
she
was
slandering
Christians
.
Nonetheless
,
radical
claims
merit
heightened
scrutiny
.
Real
Christians
,
real
people
of
various
sects
,
colors
,
and
backgrounds
,
are
implicated
and
suffer
reputational
consequences
when
subjected
to
careless
generalizations
that
affiliate
their
faith
with
evil
.
Sweeping
claims
about
diverse
groups
of
people
should
not
be
made
lightly
.
Arguing
there
is
an
ideological
link
between
Christianity
and
white
supremacy
ignores
the
existence
of
Black
,
Latino
,
and
Asian
Christians
is
their
faith
connected
to
white
supremacy
as
well
?
Moreover
,
if
Laettner
made
a
similarly
offensive
claim
about
other
religions
if
she
linked
Islam
to
terrorism
or
Judaism
to
the
oppression
of
Palestinians
then
a
severe
,
justifiable
backlash
would
occur
.
The
same
should
go
for
Christians
.

For

Four
years
ago
today
,
I
walked
into
a
hospital
,
and
my
life
changed
.
It
was
5
30
a
.
m
.
,
and
I
was
a
rising
senior
in
high
school
.
I
wore
sweatpants
and
a
soft
t
shirt
.
I
watched
as
my
mom
and
dad
signed
me
in
at
the
children’s
hospital
front
desk
.
A
nurse
stuck
around
for
a
vein
,
my
doctor
came
and
spoke
to
me
,
and
before
I
knew
it
,
I
was
asleep
.
When
I
woke
up
in
the
ICU
ten
and
a
half
hours
later
,
I
had
two
rods
,
6
hooks
,
and
8
screws
in
my
spine
,
straightening
my
scoliosis
and
promising
a
life
with
less
pain
.
Today
,
at
3
00
p
.
m
.
,
I
walked
into
another
hospital
,
in
a
different
state
,
a
rising
senior
in
college
.
I
wore
a
blue
polo
and
a
name
badge
.
I
took
the
elevator
to
the
children’s
floor
.
Only
this
time
,
I
didn’t
see
any
nurses
or
doctors
besides
the
ones
I
passed
by
in
the
hall
.
I
had
no
anesthesia
,
no
ICU
visit
,
no
week
long
hospital
stay
.
There
was
definitely
no
promise
of
a
life
with
less
pain
.
There
were
just
parents
,
like
mine
.
I
volunteer
in
the
Ronald
McDonald
House
Family
Room
in
Duke
Hospital
.
On
the
children’s
floor
,
volunteers
take
3
hour
shifts
managing
a
room
where
caregivers
can
find
free
coffee
and
snacks
,
and
can
access
laundry
,
computers
,
a
shower
and
a
quiet
,
comfortable
seating
area
.
Especially
for
families
facing
unexpected
hospital
visits
in
faraway
places
,
access
to
laundry
,
showers
and
food
can
make
all
the
difference
.
But
the
Family
Room’s
most
essential
function
,
as
I’ve
seen
in
my
year
and
a
half
as
a
volunteer
,
is
as
a
space
to
rest
from
the
burden
of
caring
for
a
child
in
pain
.
Much
of
what
I
know
about
my
time
in
the
hospital
is
based
on
what
my
parents
told
me
later
.
They
were
too
nervous
to
eat
all
day
,
but
when
the
surgery
was
finally
over
,
out
of
nowhere
,
Subway
sandwiches
materialized
.
They
still
have
no
idea
who
brought
them
.
I
think
about
that
every
time
the
elevator
opens
on
the
children’s
floor
.
When
my
parents
would
tell
me
later
about
how
challenging
it
was
to
watch
me
in
such
pain
,
I
would
often
get
angry
and
resentful
.
It
was
a
foreign
feeling
,
one
that
surprised
me
.
Why
would
I
ever
be
frustrated
at
them
expressing
their
love
for
me
,
their
pain
at
watching
me
hurt
?
But
as
the
weeks
,
months
and
years
after
my
surgery
went
by
,
my
pain
didn’t
go
away
.
Four
years
later
,
I
still
carry
chronic
back
and
muscle
pain
.
I’ll
carry
that
pain
for
the
rest
of
my
life
.
Pain
is
one
of
the
most
isolating
experiences
a
person
can
have
.
Someone
can
ask
you
to
describe
it
,
rate
it
,
talk
about
it
,
but
no
matter
how
much
they
care
,
they’ll
never
fully
understand
what
it
feels
like
.
Pain
necessarily
makes
us
turn
inward
on
ourselves
,
taking
us
to
places
where
it’s
harder
to
hear
the
voices
of
the
people
who
love
us
.

When
I
heard
my
parents
talk
about
the
pain
of
watching
me
hurt
,
my
deepest
,
most
angry
and
maladjusted
inner
voice
exclaimed
,
But
in
the
Family
Room
,
I’ve
learned
that
that’s
absolutely
not
true
.
It
is
hard
to
be
in
pain
;
I
know
that
well
.
But
in
many
ways
,
it
is
harder
to
watch
someone
you
love
be
in
pain
and
not
be
able
to
fix
it
.
It
hurts
to
be
isolated
by
pain
,
and
it
also
hurts
to
love
and
care
for
someone
isolated
by
pain
especially
when
that
person
is
unable
to
express
their
pain
to
you
.
The
pain
that
parents
feel
at
watching
their
child
hurt
is
a
pain
that
often
goes
unacknowledged
by
the
people
around
them
.
The
pain
of
sitting
with
someone
who
is
hurting
is
as
valid
as
the
pain
of
the
person
physically
hurting
.
A
part
of
me
hopes
that
by
making
another
pot
of
coffee
,
by
folding
somebody’s
warm
baby
clothes
,
by
talking
to
a
parent
who
needs
a
listening
ear
,
I
can
lessen
the
pain
they
experience
,
that
my
parents
experienced
.
But
even
with
something
to
eat
and
a
warm
drink
in
our
hands
,
painful
memories
will
live
with
these
parents
and
my
parents
the
way
it
lives
with
these
children
and
me
,
for
the
rest
of
our
lives
.
Today
,
even
as
I
look
back
and
acknowledge
that
pain
,
I’m
trying
to
look
ahead
.
Imagining
a
future
can
be
challenging
when
you
know
you’ll
be
in
pain
for
the
rest
of
your
life
.
But
this
year
,
I
am
imagining
a
future
a
senior
year
,
and
a
life
beyond
Duke
in
which
I
carry
with
me
the
spirit
of
the
Family
Room
.
The
Family
Room
is
a
place
where
you
can
assume
that
every
person
you
meet
is
struggling
with
an
immense
amount
of
pain
pain
like
my
parents’
,
pain
like
mine
.
We
acknowledge
that
pain
by
being
extraordinarily
gentle
with
one
another
.
We
find
that
last
bag
of
Doritos
,
we
make
room
for
more
people
when
they
arrive
,
and
we
don’t
ask
prying
questions
.
We
just
hold
space
.
As
someone
who
carries
pain
with
them
,
and
who
loves
a
lot
of
people
who
carry
my
pain
,
too
,
I
wish
all
spaces
were
as
gentle
as
the
Family
Room
.
I
especially
wish
that
for
my
sweet
parents
,
the
ones
who
scarfed
down
sandwiches
someone
else
thought
to
buy
them
four
years
ago
today
and
have
hurt
alongside
me
ever
since
.
So
as
we
round
the
corner
on
August
,
I
want
to
learn
to
hold
the
kind
of
space
I
find
in
the
family
room
everywhere
I
go
.
To
assume
nothing
about
a
person
except
that
their
life
is
as
complex
as
mine
,
their
trauma
as
deep
and
wounding
.
To
be
present
with
people
in
their
pain
.
My
time
in
the
hospital
,
then
and
now
,
has
taught
me
that
all
of
us
hurt
.
All
of
us
know
someone
who
is
hurting
.
This
year
,
I
want
to
act
like
it
.

This
June
,
The
Chronicle
published
an
astounding
report
revealing
that
there
are
nearly
13
times
more
registered
Democrats
than
registered
Republicans
on
Duke’s
faculty
.
That
kind
of
gap
sounds
improbable
if
not
impossible
and
yet
,
here
we
are
.
And
if
,
for
whatever
unholy
reason
,
you
keep
up
with
national
higher
education
trends
,
you
know
that
this
discrepancy
fits
the
norm
.
The
disparity
between
liberal
and
conservative
professors
is
large
,
and
growing
;
national
statistics
showed
a
6
1
ratio
between
the
two
.
In
New
England
,
the
ratio
was
found
to
be
28
1
.
As
is
clear
through
The
Chronicle’s
reporting
,
different
fields
appear
to
be
affected
differently
.
At
Duke
,
Pratt
has
the
least
amount
of
disparity
.
Although
its
faculty
is
left
leaning
,
Pratt
had
the
largest
percent
share
of
Republicans
and
the
lowest
percentage
of
party
alignment
of
any
of
the
disciplines
studied
.
And
while
the
natural
sciences
leaned
Democratic
,
almost
all
of
their
departments
have
some
share
of
Republicans
.
It
is
the
Arts
and
Humanities
and
Social
Sciences
disciplines
that
seem
to
lack
conservative
professors
.
Most
of
the
departments
in
these
disciplines
lack
any
conservatives
.
The
Social
Sciences
do
have
some
Republicans
,
but
they
are
focused
in
a
few
select
fields
like
economics
and
political
science
.
How
did
we
get
here
?
Some
might
assume
this
to
be
the
natural
state
of
academia
;
there
have
always
been
more
liberals
than
conservatives
,
right
?
Not
at
all
.
This
trend
has
only
become
prevalent
over
the
past
twenty
five
years
.
In
the
face
of
such
glaring
imbalance
,
it’s
easy
to
make
claims
of
discrimination
.
The
reason
there
are
so
few
conservative
professors
is
that
administrators
are
part
of
a
nefarious
Communist
agenda
to
take
over
the
universities
.
But
,
of
course
,
correlation
does
not
equal
causation
.
There
have
been
anecdotal
reports
of
discrimination
against
conservatives
in
graduate
admissions
,
but
a
nationwide
experiment
found
no
significant
evidence
of
bias
.
There
are
many
reasons
why
such
a
disparity
could
have
been
created
.
For
one
,
liberal
leaning
students
generally
consider
graduate
school
more
often
than
their
conservative
counterparts
.
Conservatives
also
tend
to
gravitate
towards
professional
work
.
Conservative
politicians
have
used
the
trend
of
left
leaning
faculties
to
accuse
universities
of
indoctrinating
students
and
propagating
a
liberal
agenda
.
What
does
this
really
mean
,
though
?
Universities
have
two
major
functions
to
share
knowledge
and
to
create
knowledge
.
The
first
is
accomplished
through
teaching
.
The
second
is
accomplished
through
research
,
peer
review
,
and
debate
.
Is
teaching
corrupted
by
a
liberal
leaning
faculty
?
Not
really
.
Students
don’t
passively
accept
the
opinions
and
arguments
of
their
professors
.
Conservative
students
,
apparently
,
cannot
be
programmed
by
their
professors
.
Despite
the
fears
of
conservative
politicians
,
indoctrination
is
not
so
easy
.
It
does
seem
,
however
,
that
the
creation
of
knowledge
is
threatened
by
a
homogenous
professoriate
.
In
a
lecture
given
at
Duke
,
social
psychologist
Jonathan
Haidt
describes
the
importance
of
viewpoint
diversity
.
As
individuals
,
we
regularly
use
motivated
reasoning
to
confirm
our
beliefs
.
Even
when
we
look
at
the
evidence
,
we
resist
conclusions
we
dislike
and
actively
work
to
find
what
we
want
.
A
university
setting
is
built
to
remove
these
biases
by
pitting
biases
against
each
other
.
Haidt
calls
this
institutionalized
disconfirmation
.
Scholars
are
forced
to
prune
their
biases
out
of
their
work
before
submitting
it
.
If
not
,
they
get
called
out
by
their
colleagues
.
For
this
reason
,
the
reputation
of
a
discipline
is
predicated
on
how
well
it
peer
reviews
the
knowledge
it
produces
.
Journalism
is
a
strong
example
of
this
principle
.
In
recent
years
,
public
trust
in
journalism
and
mainstream
media
has
sharply
decreased
.
Inaccuracy
and
bias
are
stated
as
the
leading
reasons
for
distrusting
journalists
.
This
perception
comes
from
faulty
and
hasty
reporting
by
newspapers
caused
by
a
lack
of
proper
editing
and
peer
review
usually
due
to
a
rushed
deadline
.

Universities
have
by
and
large
maintained
their
respectability
as
a
result
of
the
rigorous
debate
they
encourage
.
But
,
Haidt
notes
,
debate
is
weakened
when
there
is
a
lack
of
different
viewpoints
.
When
an
orthodox
position
is
created
in
this
case
due
to
a
certain
political
leaning
,
it
is
less
likely
to
be
debated
rigorously
.
Those
who
hold
the
position
accept
it
strongly
but
adopt
weak
arguments
with
which
to
defend
it
.
This
creates
a
certain
intellectual
fragility
where
the
orthodox
idea
can
be
broken
easily
but
isn’t
because
of
a
bias
in
the
group
.
Rigorous
debate
isn’t
just
damaged
between
academics
,
it’s
also
lost
between
students
.
This
is
seen
in
national
data
regarding
debate
among
university
students
.
Conservatives
and
libertarians
are
far
less
likely
to
share
their
beliefs
and
are
more
likely
to
receive
poor
treatment
due
to
their
politics
.
A
majority
of
students
in
a
2017
survey
stated
that
their
university
did
not
encourage
intellectual
diversity
.
How
can
knowledge
be
created
when
you’re
too
scared
to
speak
?
Where
is
knowledge
creation
being
influenced
?
Left
leaning
bias
probably
won’t
matter
in
most
departments
.
A
biologist
will
not
lose
their
ability
to
research
bacterial
DNA
because
they
believe
in
universal
healthcare
.
In
general
,
it
is
the
social
sciences
that
are
most
affected
by
political
bias
.
Whether
it
is
economics
,
political
science
,
gender
studies
,
or
sociology
,
these
fields
produce
politically
engaged
work
.
Trying
to
objectively
measure
the
success
or
failure
of
Reaganomics
is
made
more
difficult
if
you
voted
for
or
against
it
.
The
best
way
to
ensure
that
you
do
is
to
have
someone
of
the
opposite
persuasion
looking
over
your
work
.
It
is
critical
that
the
social
sciences
remain
impartial
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
these
fields
regularly
influence
government
policy
and
public
opinion
.
The
public
needs
to
know
that
when
they
read
about
sociological
studies
they
are
receiving
unbiased
and
meaningful
information
.
Let’s
take
history
for
example
.
The
History
Department
has
no
registered
Republicans
;
its
faculty
is
almost
75
percent
Democratic
.
What
does
this
mean
for
coverage
of
Republican
Party
history
,
or
even
the
history
of
conservatism
in
the
United
States
?
The
problem
isn’t
that
professors
are
scheming
to
get
their
viewpoints
supported
.
As
stated
before
,
humans
have
an
innate
difficulty
in
fairly
defending
and
recognizing
positions
they
disagree
with
.
But
why
should
historians
care
?
In
fact
,
why
should
liberals
care
?
If
they’re
winning
the
debate
stage
,
why
cater
to
conservative
complaints
?
Haidt
uses
a
quote
from
John
Stuart
Mill
to
answer
this
question
.
He
who
knows
only
his
own
side
of
the
case
knows
little
of
that
.
His
reasons
may
be
good
,
and
no
one
may
have
been
able
to
refute
them
.
But
if
he
is
equally
unable
to
refute
the
reasons
on
the
opposite
side
,
if
he
does
not
so
much
as
know
what
they
are
,
he
has
no
ground
for
preferring
either
opinion
.
Without
an
intellectual
sparring
partner
to
oppose
them
,
liberal
arguments
become
weaker
.
They
are
less
truthful
,
less
meaningful
,
and
less
useful
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
.
Everyone
is
harmed
by
these
trends
.
There
are
definite
problems
when
the
professoriate
has
a
political
leaning
.
The
cries
of
apocalypse
by
conservative
politicians
,
however
,
are
moot
.
Students
aren’t
being
indoctrinated
and
many
conservative
professors
are
content
with
their
careers
.
In
fact
,
most
of
the
concerns
of
a
crisis
are
coming
from
older
Republicans
.
As
in
,
the
ones
who
are
not
actually
in
school
.
But
,
does
there
need
to
be
a
response
?
Well
yes
and
no
.
Yes
,
we
need
to
study
the
effects
of
bias
more
.
We
need
to
know
the
result
of
having
a
13
1
Democrat
Republican
ratio
.
But
also
,
no
.
How
much
can
we
do
?
Purposefully
hire
more
Republican
leaning
professors
?
That’s
discrimination
not
to
mention
an
impossible
hiring
metric
.
Creating
that
kind
of
ideological
barrier
to
entry
for
a
professorship
would
be
mayhem
.
We
need
more
data
,
more
research
,
and
more
debate
about
this
topic
itself
.
Letting
liberals
ignore
it
won’t
solve
anything
;
we
also
can’t
let
conservatives
bemoan
political
bias
without
proper
research
.
Journalism
succumbed
to
a
lack
of
public
trust
let’s
save
universities
from
that
fate
.
We
are
now
a
few
weeks
into
the
new
academic
year
,
which
means
many
of
us
are
inevitably
transitioning
into
our
latest
campus
leadership
roles
.
I
remember
being
surprised
when
I
got
to
Duke
that
so
many
of
these
positions
were
held
by
sophomores
or
juniors
.
In
high
school
,
at
least
in
my
experience
,
seniors
essentially
had
a
monopoly
on
most
of
those
positions
.
But
in
college
,
when
the
tenure
of
a
position
formally
ends
,
the
student
holding
it
oftentimes
won’t
yet
be
graduating
.
On
the
contrary
,
they
may
have
one
or
two
years
left
at
Duke
,
which
poses
a
question
should
those
students
continue
to
serve
in
their
positions
or
pass
them
on
to
others
?
There
are
a
lot
of
reasons
that
people
seek
out
leadership
positions
passion
for
an
issue
,
commitment
to
an
organization
,
the
occasional
resume
builder
.
Despite
thorough
transition
guides
or
the
cooperation
of
former
leaders
,
the
learning
curve
is
steep
when
the
buck
stops
with
you
.
A
second
year
in
a
leadership
position
would
inevitably
improve
efficiency
,
as
lessons
learned
can
be
translated
into
adjusted
organizational
efforts
by
the
person
or
group
of
people
with
firsthand
experience
.
However
,
that
improved
efficiency
is
not
always
worth
the
sacrifices
that
accompany
identical
leadership
within
an
organization
.
The
ability
to
let
go
of
a
leadership
position
is
not
simply
an
important
character
trait
to
hone
on
a
personal
level
,
but
it
is
also
vital
for
the
sustained
strength
of
an
organization
.
There
are
logistical
justifications
for
this
who
wants
to
be
the
person
to
replace
someone
who
has
held
a
position
for
2
years
?
Will
the
replacement
have
the
skills
and
knowledge
necessary
after
being
so
limited
in
their
exposure
to
varying
leadership
styles
?
But
there
are
ethical
justifications
for
this
continued
transition
of
power
as
well
.
Opening
up
positions
allows
the
organization
to
be
strengthened
by
new
perspectives
.
The
transition
teaches
the
organization
not
only
how
to
continue
after
the
loss
of
paramount
leaders
,
but
how
to
become
strengthened
by
new
perspectives
.
When
one
person
is
consistently
calling
the
shots
,
important
voices
are
excluded
and
those
who
have
not
had
access
to
similar
roles
in
the
past
may
never
have
that
opportunity
.
Additionally
,
it
is
critical
that
we
are
forced
to
understand
our
successes
and
failures
in
a
way
that
allows
us
to
communicate
our
experiences
and
advice
to
our
successors
.
In
doing
this
effectively
,
they
too
will
have
the
skills
to
absorb
lessons
learned
and
tangibly
change
the
student
group
for
the
better
.
This
is
not
necessarily
a
one
size
fits
all
approach
.
All
organizations
function
differently
and
new
student
groups
in
particular
may
be
in
need
of
more
consistent
leadership
for
the
first
few
years
.
However
,
no
matter
the
individual
circumstances
of
an
organization
,
leaders
and
members
should
take
the
time
to
consistently
challenge
power
structures
and
the
best
ways
to
maintain
their
organizational
strength
and
influence
.
Strength
stability
.
When
the
founders
or
long
time
leaders
have
graduated
,
can
the
organization
sustain
itself
?
Have
fresh
minds
and
voices
been
provided
with
the
tools
necessary
to
continue
its
growth
?
We
only
have
four
years
here
a
lesson
that
we
all
end
up
learning
far
too
quickly
.
Duke
is
composed
of
thousands
of
students
;
we
all
have
strengths
,
weaknesses
,
biases
,
and
niche
expertise
.
When
we
forego
additional
years
in
a
position
,
we
ensure
that
the
breadth
of
diversity
present
on
Duke’s
campus
is
sustained
within
our
organizations
and
throughout
campus
leadership
roles
.
I
know
that
I
personally
have
benefited
,
both
directly
and
indirectly
,
from
the
students
before
me
who
passed
on
a
role
,
trusting
that
the
position
and
corresponding
organization
were
safe
in
my
hands
.
Enjoy
this
year
of
contributing
fiercely
to
your
respective
communities
and
making
our
campus
better
.
And
then
teach
others
how
to
do
the
same
,
knowing
that
your
advocacy
need
not
end
with
the
formal
title
that
you
hold
so
dear
.
Dear
loyal
reader
,
I
assume
your
question
is
not
a
simple
whodunit
.
’
Unless
Campus
Security
has
leads
they
cannot
disclose
to
The
Chronicle
,
the
identity
of
the
miscreant
will
likely
remain
unknown
,
and
the
matter
relegated
to
the
cold
case
files
.
So
the
more
pertinent
question
is
the
ethical
issue
at
hand
who
should
have
cleaned
up
the
egg
?
When
our
peers
behave
abominably
,
do
we
have
an
obligation
to
intervene
?
I’d
start
the
answer
with
a
cliche
that
rings
true
How
one
behaves
when
nobody
is
watching
is
a
true
test
of
character
.
Sure
,
nobody
saw
you
spill
your
latte
on
the
common
room
couch
,
so
conceivably
you
can
slip
away
without
cleaning
up
.
And
if
a
few
days
later
your
hallmates
remark
about
how
putrid
the
common
room
has
become
,
you
can
feign
ignorance
or
maybe
even
blame
it
on
someone
else
.
But
once
that
frothed
milk
sours
,
it
will
be
your
gift
to
the
student
body
for
months
to
come
.
Is
it
worth
it
to
stand
up
and
walk
ten
feet
to
grab
a
paper
towel
?
Ditch
that
thought
somebody
posted
on
Instagram
!
But
let’s
assume
the
egg
cracker
shirked
his
obvious
duty
to
clean
up
.
Perhaps
he
was
hysterical
in
the
moment
,
or
egged
on
by
another
inebriated
freshman
.
Do
it
once
,
and
maybe
it
can
be
forgotten
.
But
after
a
few
repetitions
,
it
is
no
longer
a
prank
,
an
immature
moment
,
an
aberration
.
It
is
who
you
are
.
The
next
line
of
defense
to
abject
squalor
is
the
cleaning
staff
.
In
terms
of
responsibility
,
it
is
their
job
to
clean
up
.
It
is
literally
what
they
are
paid
to
do
.
But
as
Duke
students
,
leaving
unholy
messes
for
the
cleaning
staff
is
nbsp
;
inappropriate
.
Technically
speaking
,
nobody
can
fault
an
individual
student
for
leaving
the
slop
for
the
cleaning
crew
,
but
ask
yourself
if
that’s
the
way
you
want
to
live
.
It
is
dispiriting
and
degrading
to
avert
one’s
eyes
from
a
rancid
mess
over
an
entire
weekend
.
How
many
times
can
you
step
over
a
repulsive
,
reeking
pile
of
rot
.
How
long
can
you
disregard
nasty
,
noxious
organic
matter
?
At
some
undefined
point
,
it
becomes
your
mess
,
your
environment
,
your
habitat
.
It
becomes
part
of
your
identity
.
And
if
you
leave
such
vile
conditions
in
your
midst
,
it
becomes
a
new
normal
.
As
Duke
students
,
we
share
a
measure
of
collective
responsibility
.
nbsp
;
If
you
are
willing
to
bask
in
the
glory
of
being
a
member
of
the
exalted
class
of
fill
in
the
blank
,
then
you
must
also
accept
responsibility
.
It
is
natural
to
feel
proud
if
a
fellow
Duke
student
achieves
greatness
,
but
the
flip
side
is
feeling
shame
when
a
classmate
misbehaves
.
So
who
that
egg
cracker
?
Does
it
really
matter
?
Take
a
stand
.
Set
an
example
by
cleaning
up
.
Follow
the
advice
of
the
United
States
National
Park
Service
Leave
no
Trace
.
Then
take
it
one
step
further
by
packing
out
more
that
what
you
brought
in
.
Experienced
hikers
do
this
in
national
forests
,
leaving
the
park
cleaner
than
how
it
was
when
they
entered
.
And
if
you
are
not
willing
to
clean
up
,
then
speak
up
.
Write
a
note
asking
others
to
be
more
considerate
.
Or
if
you
figure
out
who
did
it
,
move
the
mess
to
his
or
her
doorstep
.
Consider
it
room
service
in
reverse
.
Anyone
with
a
heart
,
brain
,
and
conscious
knows
that
there
are
certain
messes
you
do
not
make
.
Otherwise
,
you
become
a
soulless
pig
.
This
summer
,
like
many
summers
in
recent
memory
,
was
hot
.
was
the
hottest
month
in
recorded
history
.
Greenland’s
ice
sheet
lost
in
one
day
.
Smoke
from
Amazon
fires
in
cities
thousands
of
kilometers
away
.
The
ominous
prognosis
that
we
have
only
to
prevent
irreversible
,
catastrophic
climate
change
,
seems
grim
.
In
the
face
of
a
phenomenon
that
promises
to
fundamentally
change
the
planet
and
our
relation
to
it
and
one
another
,
many
people
respond
understandably
with
anxiety
.
How
can
we
go
on
with
our
lives
like
normal
while
the
future
is
uncertain
?
When
climate
change
is
characterized
as
,
others
feel
overwhelmed
and
powerless
to
change
anything
.
And
perhaps
most
troubling
,
some
believe
that
for
what
we’ve
done
to
the
environment
as
though
all
of
humanity
shares
equal
blame
for
and
equal
consequences
of
climate
change
!
.
Instead
of
succumbing
to
despair
or
condemning
humanity
to
extinction
,
we
must
organize
.
We
must
move
purposefully
to
bring
about
transformative
environmental
and
climate
justice
.
To
do
this
,
we
must
also
have
a
clear
eyed
understanding
of
the
root
causes
of
this
environmental
crisis
.
Yes
,
climate
change
is
driven
by
human
activity
but
not
just
any
human
activity
.
It
is
capitalism
,
working
in
tandem
with
white
supremacy
,
settler
colonialism
,
and
imperialism
,
that
has
threatened
not
just
the
environment
but
the
lives
of
primarily
Black
,
Brown
,
and
Indigenous
people
all
over
the
world
.
The
Amazon
burning
is
a
stark
example
of
this
.
The
Amazon
rainforest
was
purposefully
set
on
fire
to
,
and
destroying
the
land
that
sustains
them
.
Brazil’s
far
right
president
has
favored
increasing
agribusiness
industry
access
to
the
Amazon
at
the
expense
of
environmental
conservation
and
Indigenous
territorial
integrity
.
But
before
we
blame
exclusively
Bolsonaro
for
the
Amazon
fires
,
we
should
examine
the
fact
that
the
United
States
played
a
role
in
creating
the
conditions
of
this
disaster
.
There
is
that
the
Obama
administration
a
in
Brazil
,
which
paved
the
way
for
a
right
wing
government
friendly
to
US
corporations
like
and
capitalist
interests
.
This
is
just
one
example
in
an
extensive
and
ongoing
that
has
consistently
placed
Western
capital
above
workers
,
poor
folks
,
people
of
color
,
Indigenous
peoples
,
and
the
environment
.
So
it
is
disingenuous
to
say
that
we
are
all
responsible
for
climate
change
and
then
to
condemn
us
to
extinction
when
it
is
generally
the
Global
North
driving
climate
change
and
the
Global
South
bearing
the
brunt
of
the
consequences
.
,
between
1850
2011
,
the
United
States
was
the
single
largest
cumulative
emitter
of
CO2
,
producing
27
percent
of
global
emissions
.
European
countries
emitted
another
25
percent
.
Data
from
the
World
Bank
shows
that
OECD
countries
,
whose
36
members
are
predominantly
concentrated
in
the
West
,
produce
an
average
of
of
waste
double
the
next
biggest
waste
producing
regions
.
All
the
while
,
Western
nations
have
in
Asian
countries
like
China
,
Malaysia
,
and
Indonesia
.
And
of
course
,
the
on
the
planet
.
If
we
are
going
to
get
serious
about
addressing
climate
change
at
its
root
,
we
must
also
recognize
that
American
militarism
and
imperial
aggression
have
been
not
only
the
means
for
intervening
in
countries
to
install
governments
with
capital
friendly
,
environmentally
destructive
policies
,
but
also
a
direct
contributor
to
climate
change
.
The
environmental
crisis
is
not
a
rapidly
approaching
future
.
The
consequences
of
climate
change
are
already
here
.
People
in
the
poorest
countries
of
the
world
are
of
heatstroke
,
hurricanes
,
and
diseases
.
Some
regions
of
India
may
become
by
2100
.
This
summer
,
in
the
middle
of
a
100
degree
heatwave
,
Con
Edison
preemptively
to
low
income
,
predominantly
Black
neighborhoods
in
Brooklyn
,
New
York
.
Because
of
,
low
income
communities
of
color
breathe
polluted
air
,
drink
poisoned
water
,
live
next
to
waste
facilities
,
and
are
thus
significantly
more
vulnerable
to
the
negative
impacts
of
climate
change
.
All
this
points
to
the
great
urgency
to
get
at
the
root
of
climate
change
if
we
want
to
enact
transformative
environmental
justice
.
Solutions
must
be
rooted
in
radical
change
combating
settler
colonialism
that
has
displaced
and
killed
Indigenous
people
and
erased
their
cultures
,
combating
capitalism
which
has
fueled
the
destruction
of
the
planet
for
profit
,
combating
racism
which
positions
Black
,
Brown
,
Indigenous
people
around
the
world
as
the
communities
most
at
risk
to
climate
change
.
What
we
need
is
eco
socialism
,
rooted
in
an
understanding
of
capitalism
,
racism
,
imperialism
,
and
their
intersections
if
we
are
to
protect
our
homes
and
one
another
.
We
are
living
in
the
crossroads
of
history
.
We
either
devolve
into
fascism
as
Western
capitalist
nations
adapt
to
climate
change
by
further
extracting
resources
from
over
exploited
countries
and
closing
their
borders
to
people
displaced
by
instability
and
environmental
disasters
facilitated
by
the
West

to

another

where
our

with
the
environment
is
based
on
sustainable

This
week
,
I
want
to
talk
about
Fannie
Lou
Hamer
.
But
first
,
let’s
talk
about
land
.
The
end
of
the
Civil
War
officially
marked
the
emancipation
of
4
million
enslaved
people
in
the
United
States
.
For
the
first
time
in
246
years
,
these
newly
freed
individuals
could
leave
the
plantations
,
travel
,
reunite
with
their
families
,
and
set
the
terms
for
their
work
,
time
,
and
energy
outside
the
slaveholder’s
authority
.
But
freedom
contained
another
promise
that
of
40
acres
and
a
mule
for
freed
men
and
women
.
The
federal
government
promised
the
redistribution
of
millions
of
acres
,
stretching
from
eastern
North
Carolina
to
the
Mississippi
Delta
,
to
those
who
could
now
,
finally
,
capture
a
slice
of
the
astronomical
wealth
their
labor
had
helped
coax
from
the
land
.
The
promise
appeared
real
South
Carolina
,
for
example
,
established
a
Land
Commission
to
assign
land
to
formerly
enslaved
people
.
Land
in
1866
meant
self
sufficiency
and
independence
from
white
rule
,
a
source
of
stability
absent
the
nominal
security
of
voting
rights
or
equal
protection
under
the
law
.
W
.
E
.
B
.
DuBois
described
this
land
hunger
as
an
absolutely
fundamental
and
essential
thing
to
any
real
emancipation
of
the
slaves
.
To
a
certain
extent
,
African
Americans
realized
this
dream
by
1910
,
Black
owned
farmland
in
Mississippi
totaled
2
.
2
million
acres
,
the
most
of
any
state
.
The
white
South
,
however
,
could
not
tolerate
Black
prosperity
and
independence
.
Their
growing
resistance
to
Reconstruction
led
to
the
closure
of
the
Freedmen’s
Bureau
in
1872
and
the
removal
of
federal
troops
from
the
South
after
the
election
of
1876
.
That
is
,
the
federal
government
caved
to
the
Redeemers
and
abandoned
Black
communities
.
In
turn
,
the
former
planter
class
,
alongside
Democratic
politicians
,
employed
intimidation
,
violence
,
lynchings
,
deceptive
contracts
,
and
the
criminal
justice
system
to
dispossess
and
displace
Black
landowners
.
The
vast
majority
of
rural
Black
folks
became
sharecroppers
tied
by
debt
to
white
landowners
;
if
entangled
in
prisons
and
jails
,
they
became
convicts
leased
for
their
labor
.
Lynchings
and
violence
,
in
particular
,
chipped
away
at
every
gain
made
by
Black
farmers
and
landowners
from
the
one
hundred
Black
farmers
murdered
in
Leflore
County
,
Mississippi
at
the
turn
of
the
20th
century
to
the
brutal
suppression
of
a
fledgling
sharecroppers’
union
in
Hernando
,
Mississippi
in
1935
.
White
Southerners
sought
to
eradicate
the
Black
claim
to
equal
rights
,
economic
opportunity
,
and
dignity
;
by
the
1960s
,
exploitation
and
subordination
of
Black
Southerners
,
especially
in
the
fertile
lands
of
the
Mississippi
Delta
,
remained
entrenched
.
nbsp
;
This
brings
me
back
to
Fannie
Lou
Hamer
,
a
sharecropper
living
in
Sunflower
County
,
Mississippi
in
1962
when
organizers
with
the
Student
Nonviolent
Coordinating
Committee
SNCC
arrived
to
register
Black
voters
.
Hamer
had
already
endured
both
poverty
and
the
notorious
Mississippi
appendectomy
,
a
forced
sterilization
robbing
her
of
the
ability
to
have
children
.
The
SNCC
organizers
radicalized
Hamer
,
who
drew
from
her
lived
experiences
to
become
a
powerful
organizer
and
essential
to
the
movement
to
challenge
white
supremacy
in
Mississippi
.
When
her
first
effort
to
register
voters
at
a
courthouse
in
Indianola
failed
,
her
boss
fired
her
and
confiscated
her
family’s
property
.
Undeterred
,
Hamer
then
rose
to
prominence
as
a
co
founder
of
the
Mississippi
Freedom
Democratic
Party
to
rival
the
segregationist
Mississippi
Democrats
and
build
a
base
of
Black
political
power
in
the
state
.
Charlie
Cobb
,
a
SNCC
activist
,
called
Hamer
a
crabgrass
politician
,
someone
who
came
to
realize
that
she
does
not
have
to
be
bound
by
any
system
;
rather
,
she
was
a
weed
,
a
threat
to
the
harmony
and
continuity
of
a
carefully
trimmed
lawn
.
In
other
words
,
Hamer
was
a
troublemaker
.
As
a
sharecropper
,
the
land
of
the
Mississippi
Delta
was
foundational
to
how
Fannie
Lou
Hamer
understood
herself
and
the
movement
for
Black
liberation
.
In
1969
,
in
the
same
places
where
Black
Mississippians
feared
lynching
and
white
supremacist
violence
,
where
freedpeople
had
struggled
for
land
ownership
,
Hamer
purchased
40
acres
of
prime
Delta
land
,
which
she
used
to
establish
the
Freedom
Farm
Cooperative
.
The
Freedom
Farm
Cooperative
modeled
the
idea
of
food
sovereignty
by
and
for
poor
Black
families
in
Sunflower
County
,
and
members
approached
land
use
communally
so
that
each
participant
had
a
stake
in
the
cooperative’s
governance
.
Collective
ownership
of
the
land
also
meant
that
Hamer
and
the
Freedom
Farm
families
had
complete
control
independent
of
any
white
authority
.
Over
1
,
500
families
belonged
to
the
Freedom
Farm
,
and
they
sustained
themselves
by
growing
cash
crops
and
vegetables
;
by
1970
,
the
Farm
had
purchased
an
additional
640
acres
and
started
a
pig
bank
to
ensure
poor
families
had
access
to
meat
.
Hamer
even
ensured
that
200
units
of
low
income
housing
were
built
on
the
land
in
addition
to
forming
other
co
op
businesses
.
Although
the
FFC
faded
by
the
mid
1970s
,
the
Freedom
Farm
briefly
revived
the
promise
of
emancipation
a
grasp
at
justice
extinguished
by
the
failures
of
Reconstruction
era
America
.
Given
the
violent
contestations
over
land
and
economic
power
endemic
to
the
post
Civil
War
United
States
,
Hamer’s
efforts
were
nothing
short
of
radical
.
I
believe
Fannie
Lou
Hamer’s
politics
dramatically
upend
how
we
understand
economics
,
land
,
power
,
democracy
,
and
citizenship
in
the
American
South
.
Echoing
Du
Bois
and
following
the
trail
shaped
by
both
the
enslaved
and
the
freed
,
Hamer
understood
that
poor
people
,
especially
poor
Black
communities
,
deserved
a
shot
at
a
decent
life
governed
by
no
one
else
but
themselves
.
More
,
Hamer
understood
liberation
as
collective
,
where
people’s
freedom
was
bound
up
in
the
freedom
of
others
.
Work
in
the
tradition
of
Fannie
Lou
Hamer
continues
today
in
Mississippi
and
across
the
South
,
exemplified
by
organizations
like
Cooperation
Jackson
in
Jackson
,
Mississippi
.
Hamer’s
legacy
,
then
,
pushes
us
to
discard
the
notion
of
a
monolithic
,
racist
,
backwards
,
South
,
to
instead
understand
the
South
as
the
site
of
both
oppression
and
resistance
,
complexity
and
clarity
,
constantly
in
flux
as
a
bellwether
for
democratic
experiments
and
the
expansion
of
who
counts
in
the
United
States
.

Even
though
I’ve
just
started
my
sophomore
year
,
freshman
year
feels
like
it
occurred
in
a
previous
lifetime
that
I
have
no
connection
to
anymore
.
Even
more
baffling
,
the
previous
summer
seems
like
a
hazy
turn
of
events
concocted
out
of
of
some
fever
dream
.
Though
these
events
seem
to
have
happened
so
long
ago
now
,
when
I
try
to
place
myself
back
in
these
parts
of
my
timeline
,
I
remember
the
individual
moments
and
days
that
seemed
to
stretch
on
forever
within
them
.
This
leads
me
to
wonder
,
how
did
those
seemingly
unending
moments
fade
away
from
my
immediate
recollection
so
fast
?
One
answer
that
always
comes
to
me
is
that
the
nature
of
our
daily
lives
at
Duke
just
simply
does
not
allow
our
immediate
memory
to
extend
further
back
than
a
day
.
There
always
seems
to
be
so
much
to
do
within
each
day
,
that
it
seems
to
take
all
of
my
mental
ability
just
to
keep
track
of
the
present
day
,
with
no
ability
to
pause
and
take
in
or
remember
the
events
of
the
previous
day
.
On
one
hand
,
staying
fully
immersed
in
the
present
without
consideration
of
the
day
before
or
the
day
to
come
might
be
seen
as
a
good
and
healthy
way
to
live
life
that
allows
one
to
take
full
advantage
of
life’s
pleasures
without
losing
time
on
worrying
about
what
has
happened
or
what
will
happen
.
However
,
more
often
than
not
,
I
find
my
fast
paced
daily
life
to
be
more
of
a
detriment
to
my
overall
experience
because
it
leaves
me
with
no
time
to
assess
where
I
am
or
where
I
am
heading
,
and
instead
just
leaves
me
with
a
constant
feeling
of
desperation
to
get
through
each
day
in
the
most
productive
manner
without
reflecting
on
the
point
of
my
productivity
.
Perhaps
I
am
alone
in
experiencing
this
daily
state
of
timelessness
in
which
time
seems
to
drag
on
with
every
day
.
However
,
based
on
conversations
that
I
have
had
with
others
here
,
this
state
of
intense
daily
schedules
eroding
any
semblance
of
time
does
not
seem
to
be
unique
to
me
.
It
seems
that
more
often
than
not
,
large
workloads
and
demands
from
various
aspects
of
life
that
pull
us
in
so
many
different
directions
on
a
daily
basis
have
made
it
exceptionally
hard
to
keep
track
of
where
we
are
in
life
.
That
ends
up
being
quite
an
issue
in
the
modern
world
,
where
everything
operates
to
increase
efficiency
and
productivity
,
but
if
we
have
no
time
to
reflect
on
the
very
fruits
of
the
intense
productivity
that
our
hyper
efficient
methods
create
,
then
is
there
any
real
worth
in
working
so
hard
to
maximize
every
moment
of
our
time
?
Is
there
any
point
to
blasting
through
life
so
fast
that
you
can
hardly
even
stop
to
enjoy
it
?
Personally
,
I
think
there
is
not
much
worth
in
a
life
that
is
conducted
at
hyper
speed
all
the
time
and
an
existence
that
sees
productivity
as
the
only
meaningful
accomplishment
worth
achieving
.
Instead
,
It
would
be
worth
it
for
all
of
us
to
carve
some
time
out
in
our
days
just
to
reflect
on
the
small
moments
so
that
we
can
break
down
everything
that
happens
,
and
not
lose
sense
of
who
we
are
in
the
fast
paced
milieu
that
defines
our
time
at
Duke
and
that
will
go
on
to
define
our
lives
in
the
future
beyond
here
.
Taking
a
few
minutes
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
take
a
step
back
and
reflect
might
seem
tiresome
,
and
just
another
thing
to
do
after
doing
so
much
already
,
but
it
could
help
us
all
take
a
moment
to
just
breath
,
relax
,
and
reflect
on
all
the
small
things
that
make
up
the
overall
hectic
,
but
rewarding
,
experiences
that
we
have
here
at
Duke
and
beyond
.
Maybe
this
conclusion
of
taking
time
to
yourself
outside
of
being
productive
is
one
that
you
have
already
come
to
based
on
your
own
personal
experiences
,
but
I
still
stand
to
reiterate
here
that
as
we
get
started
into
a
new
school
year
and
semester
,
it
might
serve
us
well
to
pay
just
a
bit
more
attention
to
making
sure
we
make
time
for
ourselves
and
don’t
allow
ourselves
to
get
too
carried
away
with
the
never
ceasing
amount
of
tasks
that
we
perform
everyday
.
After
all
,
it
would
be
a
shame
to
work
so
hard
everyday
and
end
up
feeling
lost
and
no
better
off
at
the
end
of
it
.
The
United
States
has
an
obsession
with
revenge
and
overly
punitive
punishment
.
Mass
incarceration
is
a
prime
example
of
this
infatuation
with
vengeance
as
a
virtue
.
Though
statistics
have
a
tendency
to
anesthetize
violence
,
I
implore
you
to
seriously
grapple
with
these
numbers
No
amount
of
random
error
or
changes
in
behavior
or
culture
can
come
close
to
explaining
this
phenomenon
,
not
in
the
same
way
that
the
war
on
drugs
,
class
warfare
and
a
history
of
bondage
do
.
This
country
needs
to
address
the
domestic
warfare
waged
on
the
accused
.
The
prison
industrial
complex
and
the
criminal
justice
system
fuel
the
constant
production
of
mass
suffering
and
politicians
,
including
the
establishment
left
,
fail
to
prioritize
or
even
envision
a
society
in
which
the
American
prison
is
not
a
site
of
exploitation
.
Mass
incarceration
doesn’t
affect
arbitrary
masses
of
flesh
;
rather
it
defines
the
lived
experiences
of
particular
individuals
who
are
forced
to
forever
carry
the
weight
of
their
imprisonment
.
This
column
doesn’t
provide
enough
space
to
fully
address
the
issues
and
solutions
white
supremacy
,
prison
abolitionism
,
plea
bargaining
,
CJS
reform
,
private
prisons
,
etc
.
that
exist
with
regards
to
the
prison
industrial
complex
,
but
there
already
exists
an
extremely
robust
body
of
literature
on
these
topics
.
Instead
,
I
bring
up
the
topic
of
incarceration
as
a
starting
point
to
expose
a
troubling
and
irrational
obsession
with
revenge
that
securitizes
thought
in
multiple
facets
of
life
because
this
topic
of
our
psychological
compulsions
towards
revenge
is
extremely
undercovered
.
For
instance
,
in
the
context
of
the
prison
system
,
it
is
well
documented
that
our
incarceration
rates
are
unconnected
to
the
country’s
crime
rates
and
that
overkill
in
the
justice
system
is
directly
tied
to
higher
rates
of
recidivism
.
It’s
obvious
that
a
process
of
subjecting
inmates
to
longer
sentences
,
a
lack
of
mental
health
and
substance
abuse
resources
,
poor
living
conditions
riddled
with
infectious
diseases
,
and
an
employment
system
that
cancels
anyone
with
a
criminal
record
is
not
an
effective
solution
to
cyclical
problems
within
the
most
battered
communities
.
But
despite
these
seemingly
objective
and
substantively
warranted
arguments
,
there
still
exists
a
pervasive
fear
of
being
soft
on
crime
which
paints
this
idea
of
attempting
to
understand
and
rehabilitate
convicts
as
yet
another
example
of
Hollywood
,
liberal
elites
being
out
of
touch
with
the
actual
reality
of
the
situation
.
nbsp
;
When
taken
at
face
value
,
this
appears
to
be
a
classic
example
of
the
rehabilitation
versus
retribution
debate
.
What
bothers
me
so
strongly
,
however
,
is
that
strong
empirical
evidence
already
points
in
favor
of
rehabilitation
as
a
better
heuristic
.
It
is
apparent
here
that
justice
requires
that
we
should
strive
to
abstract
away
from
our
impulse
to
avenge
and
violently
respond
to
crimes
in
favor
of
developing
policies
that
enable
ex
convicts
to
function
in
society
and
resolve
the
conditions
that
enable
criminal
behavior
in
the
first
place
;
that’s
hardly
ever
what
we
do
.
In
fact
,
we
still
tolerate
the
idea
of
breaking
down
and
dehumanizing
prisoners
simply
because
we
feel
an
emotional
and
affectual
response
in
favor
of
doing
so
.
For
instance
,
people
commonly
express
that
they
desire
to
see
prisoners
languish
and
rot
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
.
People
make
crude
,
perverse
jokes
about
prisoners
being
raped
and
cheer
gleefully
at
the
idea
of
someone
getting
assaulted
by
other
prisoners
.
It’s
obvious
here
that
the
metrics
by
which
we
evaluate
a
justice
system
are
not
based
on
its
ability
to
treat
equitably
or
minimize
future
occurrences
of
crime
;
we
instead
equivocate
justice
with
whether
it
feels
right
.
Punishment
is
no
longer
about
a
safer
society
or
closure
for
the
victim
but
an
internal
,
selfish
desire
to
imagine
violence
against
others
.
Our
ethical
obligation
is
to
reject
those
impulses
.
I
know
that
it’s
obviously
easier
to
make
these
claims
in
the
abstract
but
the
goal
of
criminal
justice
needs
to
be
punishing
fairly
and
intelligently
.
Moreover
,
it
seems
hypocritical
to
say
the
least
that
the
pure
rationalist
right
wingers
who
aspire
to
be
Ben
Shapiro
and
Charlie
Kirk
types
can
criticize
the
left
for
failing
to
delineate
the
truth
from
our
individual
emotions
and
experiences
but
are
okay
with
strongly
leveraging
feelings
of
vengeance
and
anger
in
response
to
crimes
.
These
feelings
are
ultimately
motivated
by
an
obsession
with
authority
and
insecurity
of
losing
face
;
anything
less
than
an
overkill
response
communicates
an
emasculated
and
desexualized
sense
of
masculinity
.
They
fuel
a
libidinal
desire
to
inflict
tremendous
pain
upon
the
people
that
have
hurt
us
and
those
we
empathize
with
.
The
thought
of
satisfying
that
desire
for
revenge
within
the
human
psyche
is
extremely
enticing
but
ultimately
emotionally
unfulfilling
and
detrimental
when
acted
upon
.
I
hope
that
we
collectively
think
more
about
whether
we
are
letting
revenge
dominate
our
thought
processes
.
For
instance
,
the
desire
for
revenge
will
glamorize
the
idea
of
obliterating
a
foreign
enemy
in
response
to
the
death
of
American
lives
,
even
if
that
move
may
endanger
a
greater
number
of
American
lives
.
The
desire
to
inflict
retributive
pain
explains
both
the
disdain
towards
the
softness
of
younger
generations
and
the
perspective
that
crippling
student
loan
debts
help
Millenials
finally
toughen
up
.
The
desire
to
place
the
blame
on
survivors
of
sexual
assault
is
fueled
by
a
misogynist
vengeance
complex
that
criminalizes
going
out
,
clothing
choices
,
and
actualized
sexuality
.
Though
unwanted
pregnancies
may
jeopardize
the
life
of
the
mother
and
child
,
the
anti
abortion
camp
wants
them
to
experience
the
consequences
of
irresponsibility
.
The
bottom
line
is
that
most
people
are
well
aware
that
empirical
evidence
and
logical
deductions
on
these
topics
strongly
suggest
that
the
responses
fueled
by
resentment
are
incorrect
but
then
struggle
to
reconcile
their
subconscious
impulses
in
favor
of
objective
,
rational
evidence
.
Americans
have
a
deep
love
for
this
perverted
idea
that
the
wounds
they
experienced
at
the
hands
of
unfettered
capitalism
,
racism
,
criminal
behavior
,
or
simply
bad
luck
can
somehow
be
mended
by
replicating
that
pain
onto
others
.
Almost
immediately
upon
stepping
foot
on
campus
,
most
Duke
students
pick
up
on
a
pervasive
culture
of
effortless
perfection
.
Many
students
have
already
commented
on
this
expectation
to
work
hard
and
play
hard
,
get
perfect
grades
,
have
multiple
leadership
positions
,
conduct
research
,
secure
prestigious
internships
and
still
have
a
thriving
social
life
.
It’s
a
culture
that
has
a
truly
pernicious
effect
on
our
mental
and
physical
health
,
imbuing
a
deep
sense
of
alienation
,
inadequacy
,
stress
,
depression
,
anxiety
,
and
so
on
.
Most
of
us
clearly
chafe
against
this
impossible
standard
,
and
we
remind
each
other
frequently
that
what’s
most
important
in
life
are
our
well
being
,
relationships
with
loved
ones
and
memories
we
make
with
them
.
We
urge
one
another
to
resist
the
pressure
to
overbook
and
overwork
ourselves
,
to
prioritize
sleep
,
and
to
recognize
that
we’re
not
failures
if
we
struggle
.
And
yet
,
the
pursuit
of
this
elusive
effortless
perfection
continues
to
hound
us
.
The
work
hard
,
play
hard
mentality
is
taken
for
granted
as
a
given
part
of
Duke
culture
.
You’re
not
a
Duke
student
if
you’re
not
cramming
in
Perkins
,
rushing
off
to
your
third
meeting
in
a
row
or
running
on
three
hours
of
sleep
.
We
wear
our
exhaustion
as
a
perverse
badge
of
honor
.
Collectively
,
there’s
an
acknowledgement
that
it’s
messed
up
that
so
many
of
us
are
constantly
stressed
and
drained
,
and
yet
here
we
are
.
Why
?
Why
is
the
pressure
to
succeed
so
pervasive
and
ingrained
?
We
should
know
better
and
yet
here
I
am
,
writing
this
column
at
6
30
a

m
.
My
purpose
in
this
column
,
therefore
,
is
not
to
reiterate
what
students
have
said
long
before
I
matriculated
and
perhaps
will
continue
to
say
long
after
I
graduate
.
Rather
,
I
hope
to
expose
the
identifiable
,
political
forces
that
shape
our
undergraduate
experience
and
offer
a
language
to
understand
these
forces
.
We
should
not
be
content
with
resigning
ourselves
to
the
idea
that
this
is
just
the
way
things
are
.
We
are
attending
Duke
in
the
age
of
the
corporate
,
neoliberal
university
.
Neoliberalism
as
an
economic
model
,
which
took
off
under
the
Reagan
administration
,
is
the
triumph
of
free
market
capitalism
.
In
the
wake
of
neoliberalism
,
universities
have
adapted
by
acting
like
capitalist
enterprises
.
.
.
and
increas
ing
managerial
control
of
faculty
.
It’s
increasingly
clear
that
higher
education
is
a
business
,
and
we
are
its
customers
.
We
make
an
investment
of
a
small
fortune
in
our
education
in
hopes
that
the
payoff
is
a
degree
that
will
secure
better
job
prospects
.
In
2009
,
the
cost
of
attendance
at
Duke
was
53
,
035
.
This
year
,
it’s
73
,
519
.
To
make
those
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
seem
worth
it
,
Duke
invests
in
flashy
buildings
and
amenities
rather
than
prioritizing
student
health
insurance
.
To
cut
costs
and
still
maximize
labor
productivity
,
tenure
track
faculty
positions
are
shrinking
in
number
while
Duke
increasingly
relies
on
the
contingent
labor
of
non
tenure
track
faculty
to
teach
classes
.
And
when
I
call
Duke
a
neoliberal
university
,
I
mean
it
in
an
ideological
sense
as
well
.
Neoliberalism
as
an
ideology
values
individual
responsibility
,
entrepreneurship
,
and
self
management
in
many
ways
it’s
an
extension
of
economic
values
into
a
broader
social
fabric
.
Analyzing
how
our
lived
experiences
at
Duke
are
shaped
by
neoliberalism
can
help
us
better
understand
why
the
culture
effortless
perfection
is
so
damaging
and
yet
so
persistent
.
I
came
from
a
competitive
middle
school
and
high
school
as
many
Duke
students
did
and
I
was
taught
early
on
to
treat
my
peers
as
competitors
rather
than
collaborators
or
,
perhaps
,
co
conspirators
.
The
individualist
logic
of
neoliberalism
positions
each
individual
as
responsible
for
their
own
success
.
In
the
rat
race
that
was
my
high
school
,
the
implicit
prerequisite
to
gaining
admission
to
elite
,
private
institutions
was
to
outcompete
and
devour
one
another
in
grades
,
extracurriculars
,
and
volunteering
.
When
I
arrived
at
Duke
,
the
pressure
didn’t
stop
,
and
in
some
ways
,
it
escalated
.
College
has
become
a
prerequisite
for
many
jobs
,
ever
since
the
post
World
War
II
G
.
I
.
Bill
made
higher
education
accessible
to
millions
of
veterans
though
the
bill’s
benefits
only
extended
to
white
men
.
Especially
in
the
corporate
,
neoliberal
university
,
college
is
less
a
place
for
a
romanticized
notion
of
intellectual
exploration
and
more
a
preparatory
space
to
groom
the
next
generation
of
doctors
,
lawyers
,
politicians
,
engineers
,
and
entrepreneurs
.
In
order
to
best
maximize
our
individual
marketability
and
chances
of
securing
a
good
job
after
graduation
,
the
logic
of
neoliberalism
demands
that
we
use
every
opportunity
possible
for
self
improvement
.
We
should
major
in
something
usually
a
STEM
field
that
directly
translates
into
lucrative
careers
.
Our
leisure
time
isn’t
really
leisure
time
at
all
because
we
need
resume
boosters
from
organizations
or
activities
that
gives
us
a
leg
up
in
the
internship
job
graduate
school
market
and
distinguishes
us
from
our
competitors
.
When
I
tell
myself
to
practice
self
care
and
not
worry
about
my
responsibilities
for
just
one
night
,
I
feel
guilty
,
fear
gnawing
at
me
that
I’m
not
working
hard
enough
,
that
I’m
falling
behind
while
everyone
else
is
getting
ahead
.
The
ubiquitous
stress
of
effortless
perfection
isn’t
something
that
can
be
so
easily
remedied
with
puppies
in
Perkins
or
East
Campus
carnivals
.
As
much
as
I
tell
myself
that
I
can’t
spend
my
twenties
perpetually
sleep
deprived
and
anxious
,
neoliberalism
as
an
economic
and
ideological
structure
permeates
Duke
to
its
bones
.
I
can’t
opt
out
of
the
reality
that
after
I
graduate
I
need
a
job
to
survive
,
and
if
I
want
to
survive
I
need
to
compete
.

This
certainly
sounds
bleak
and
pessimistic
.
However
,
I
want
to
argue
that
by
giving
a
name
to
the
systems
that
structure
our
lives
,
we
equip
ourselves
with
a
vocabulary
to
articulate
a
different
organization
of
the
University
and
of
society
.
To
name
the
system
is
to
begin
to
know
it
and
to
begin
to
challenge
the
underpinnings
of
neoliberal
capitalism
that
insist
that
the
only
way
to
live
is
through
competition
and
exploitation
,
rather
than
through
community
care
and
collective
resistance
.
Hello
,
it's
Better
Laettner
Than
Never
where
I
say
a
few
things
that
may
be
unpopular
opinion
.
For
example
,
I
think
we
should
use
the
Oxford
comma
.
But
anyways
.
.
.
It's
not
always
serious
,
but
sometimes
it
is
.
Better
that
I
say
it
now
than
never
.
First
,
I’d
like
to
say
,
as
I
will
tell
anyone
I
meet
in
person
,
I
recently
came
back
from
spending
my
junior
year
abroad
in
Paris
and
I
loved
it
.
Not
because
it
was
academically
easier
than
Duke
,
which
it
wasn't
though
many
people
often
associate
that
with
time
abroad
and
not
because
I
am
an
American
escapist
.
I
loved
it
because
I
took
the
opportunity
to
learn
in
a
different
culture
and
accepted
the
challenge
of
adjusting
to
a
different
academic
system
.
After
a
year
abroad
in
Paris
,
I
came
back
and
experienced
a
bit
of
a
new
shock
at
the
differences
between
our
socialization
habits
here
at
Duke
,
and
those
in
Paris
.
Of
course
,
at
this
point
I
prefer
taking
the
metro
than
taking
an
uber
,
for
example
.
As
Americans
and
specifically
as
Duke
students
there
are
many
things
we
can
learn
from
Europeans
about
work
life
balance
.
In
his
book
,
,
Jeremy
Rifkin
cites
the
oft
noted
distinction
that
Europeans
often
remark
that
Americans
live
to
work
,
while
Europeans
work
to
live
.
Duke
students
should
work
to
live
too
.
I
think
we
deserve
it
.
We
need
to
tell
ourselves
that
we
deserve
it
.
We
need
to
believe
that
we
are
hard
workers
,
but
that
we
don't
need
to
work
ourselves
past
the
point
of
exhaustion
.
In
fact
,
we
need
to
employ
a
practice
of
balance
in
all
areas
of
our
lives
.
There’s
simply
too
much
work
hard
,
play
hard
and
burnout
around
us
.
Practicing
balanced
productivity
is
much
more
productive
than
working
full
time
,
and
this
is
something
that
European
lifestyle
clearly
employs
.
There
are
many
ways
to
practice
this
,
yet
there
are
a
few
essential
facets
to
living
this
balanced
lifestyle
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
these
practices
are
exclusive
to
Europe
,
they
may
exist
in
various
places
throughout
the
world
,
it
is
just
to
say
that
these
are
the
differences
I
noticed
between
France
and
the
United
States
.
First
,
the
French
strongly
demonstrate
that
the
work
day
ends
when
the
work
day
ends
.
The
French
usually
finish
work
at
5
,
and
head
to
a
café
to
have
an
apéro
with
a
friend
or
lover
.
They
stay
there
for
dinner
,
or
have
a
picnic
with
a
bottle
of
wine
along
the
river
.
They
enjoy
their
company
and
their
meal
for
several
hours
.
That
is
hours
of
time
spent
living
as
a
human
,
focused
on
nothing
but
interaction
,
discussion
,
and
enjoyment
.
nbsp
;
Since
the
time
of
the
Puritans
,
America
has
strongly
adhered
to
the
Protestant
work
ethic
which
proclaims
a
virtue
of
hard
work
.
According
to
strands
of
Protestant
theology
,
the
idea
of
hard
work
contains
a
redemptive
element
for
an
individual
both
in
the
eyes
of
God
and
those
of
our
fellow
humans
.
Our
Protestant
ideals
,
however
current
or
historic
they
may
seem
,
lend
to
a
belief
that
we
should
suffer
for
our
work
.
This
high
value
placed
on
work
is
pervasive
in
American
culture
.
However
,
people
can
kill
themselves
this
way
.
A
similar
work
too
hard
trend
has
seen
Japanese
men
dying
on
the
subways
during
their
commutes
due
to
excessive
overtime
work
.
We
all
have
the
same
number
of
hours
in
our
days
.
What
matters
is
how
you
choose
to
spend
them
.
If
you
find
yourself
overwhelmed
with
work
,
maybe
take
an
hour
break
so
that
you
can
come
back
and
be
more
productive
.
Go
outside
and
let
your
mind
rest
.
Study
in
a
way
that
sustains
you
.
Second
,
the
French
understand
the
importance
of
socialization
for
wellbeing
.
Beneficial
socialization
,
or
what
some
might
call
deep
play
is
great
for
you
.
Americans
tend
to
place
a
high
value
on
being
busy
,
whereas
Europeans
tend
to
place
a
higher
focus
on
balance
,
and
they
seem
to
be
more
productive
for
it
.
I
know
for
me
personally
,
I
do
my
work
better
when
I
have
had
the
right
amount
of
rest
and
can
commit
all
of
my
focus
on
one
task
at
a
time
.
Side
note
Europeans
also
seem
to
practice
the
well
known
secret
that
it
is
better
to
enjoy
a
drink
with
a
meal
,
than
to
over
drink
.
The
French
are
known
for
combining
their
great
wines
with
their
great
cheeses
.
The
whole
idea
of
an
apéro
is
a
warm
up
to
whet
the
appetite
for
dinner
.
Less
binge
drinking
and
more
conversing
.

Finally
,
the
French
appropriately
value
community
.
I
think
that
there
is
a
lack
of
community
in
certain
areas
in
America
.
When
one
looks
at
many
of
the
perpetrators
of
rampant
gun
violence
,
it
is
clear
that
those
individuals
are
often
highly
isolated
from
a
healthy
community
.
They
self
exclude
from
a
healthy
group
,
or
have
been
disassociated
with
their
home
community
,
and
instead
join
a
dangerous
online
community
.
This
lack
of
community
influences
many
problems
in
the
United
States
,
and
if
we
recognize
the
cultural
cues
into
this
loss
of
community
,
we
could
perhaps
address
these
problems
.
One
cultural
cue
is
our
American
ideal
of
freedom
.
As
Rifkin
points
out
,
Americans
and
Europeans
have
two
different
understandings
of
freedom
For
Americans
,
freedom
has
long
been
associated
with
autonomy
One
is
free
by
becoming
self
reliant
and
an
island
unto
oneself
.
For
Europeans
it
is
inclusivity
that
brings
security
belonging
,
not
belongings
.
Balancing
work
and
life
nbsp
;
is
better
for
the
nbsp
;
mind
,
overall
wellbeing
,
and
greater
community
.
It
is
better
that
we
form
and
maintain
large
communities
.
It
is
better
that
we
include
diversity
and
diverse
thought
and
language
but
that
is
for
another
op
ed
altogether
.
There
are
things
we
can
learn
from
the
European
quality
of
life
,
and
things
that
we
should
do
because
we
as
Duke
students
and
human
beings
deserve
it
.
Rest
to
improve
productivity
,
socialize
to
improve
yourself
,
and
create
inclusive
environments
to
improve
community
.
Back
to
school
season
has
always
been
one
of
my
favorite
times
of
the
year
.
I
eagerly
anticipate
the
return
of
routine
and
happy
reunions
with
friends
.
And
while
I
long
for
roots
that
I
can
put
down
longer
than
a
few
months
at
a
time
,
I
don’t
mind
packing
and
moving
when
it
means
the
beginning
of
a
bright
new
school
year
.
In
fact
,
I
consider
myself
so
adept
at
the
move
in
process
,
having
now
lived
in
five
dorms
and
two
apartments
,
plus
a
bunkhouse
in
the
past
four
years
,
that
I
figured
moving
from
my
Durham
apartment
to
my
dorm
would
be
a
breeze
.
When
I
would
mention
my
plan
to
transfer
most
of
my
earthly
possessions
from
one
place
to
another
to
friends
and
family
,
they
all
said
the
same
thing
in
response
.
It’s
not
that
the
people
in
my
life
underestimate
me
.
It’s
that
they
know
me
.
They
know
that
I
live
with
chronic
back
and
muscle
pain
,
and
that
while
I
too
fast
.
We
have
places
to
be
!
I
think
I
also
share
her
need
to
be
moving
,
to
do
as
much
as
I
can
for
the
people
I
love
.
I’m
conflicted
in
telling
people
that
limitations
are
okay
,
boundaries
are
good
,
and
self
care
is
vital
,
knowing
that
Gigi
prioritized
the
wellbeing
of
her
family
and
community
above
her
own
needs
for
her
entire
life
.
But
I
also
know
that
the
ability
to
take
care
of
myself
in
this
way
is
a
privilege
,
one
Gigi
fought
for
her
children
and
her
children’s
children
to
have
.
I
know
that
she
loved
me
,
and
was
proud
of
me
,
and
that
I
was
precious
to
her
.
I
know
that
if
we
could
talk
now
,
she
would
remind
me
that
it
was
a
dream
come
true
for
her
to
see
her
grandchildren
achieve
their
dreams
.
She
would
chastise
me
for
thinking
that
anybody
can
do
everything
and
would
remind
me
that
even
her
incredibly
capable
,
beautiful
body
could
not
live
and
work
and
breathe
forever
.
I
know
that
I
can’t
do
everything
.
I
also
know
that
the
people
around
me
will
carry
my
loads
alongside
me
.
I
need
their
love
now
,
as
I
start
the
school
year
with
a
sore
,
aching
heart
and
a
sometimes
sore
,
aching
body
.
But
I
will
be
remembering
this
year
,
as
I
anticipate
the
day
when
I’ll
pack
my
room
into
the
car
and
leave
here
for
the
last
time
,
that
the
best
way
I
can
honor
my
grandmother
is
to
treat
this
body
as
sacred
limited
,
of
course
,
but
deserving
of
love
all
the
same
.
What
a
privilege
to
carry
such
a
legacy
.
My
first
language
was
French
.
It
was
what
I
spoke
at
home
.
My
second
language
was
Spanish
.
It
was
what
I
spoke
with
my
community
.
My
third
language
was
English
.
It
was
what
I
spoke
at
school
.
I
never
had
much
difficulty
with
words
.
Language
always
came
relatively
easy
to
me
.
Using
words
though
?
That
was
a
completely
different
story
.
I
knew
how
to
use
words
to
formulate
my
sentences
except
for
grammar
thank
God
for
editors
and
get
my
ideas
and
thoughts
across
,
but
for
so
long
I
simply
didn’t
vocalize
them
.
They
collected
in
my
head
waiting
for
someone
to
free
them
from
the
agony
of
only
having
myself
to
talk
to
.
I
never
spoke
much
as
a
child
.
Most
of
the
time
,
I
only
spoke
when
spoken
too
.
I
don’t
really
remember
why
I
didn’t
speak
.
It
was
kind
of
just
who
I
was
.
I
watched
.
I
listened
.
But
I
did
not
dare
speak
.
This
continued
on
as
as
I
grew
older
,
and
my
own
refusal
to
speak
became
more
and
more
aggravating
.
Whenever
people
asked
for
my
opinion
I
paused
long
enough
that
either
someone
else
chimed
nbsp
;
in
,
or
the
situation
became
incredibly
awkward
,
and
the
questioner
decided
to
move
on
to
someone
else
.
Whenever
someone
said
or
did
something
that
made
me
uncomfortable
,
I
didn’t
voice
my
concerns
.
I
wanted
to
.
I
wanted
to
say
something
so
badly
,
but
I
couldn't
muster
up
the
strength
to
do
it
.
Why
couldn’t
I
just
open
my
mouth
and
say
what
I
needed
to
say
?
What
was
so
difficult
about
speaking
,
about
engaging
in
conversation
?
Girl
suck
it
up
and
speak
the
voice
in
the
back
of
my
head
would
always
say
.
But
I
was
stubborn
and
I
never
listened
to
that
version
of
me
.
She
was
the
me
that
was
bold
and
confident
and
didn’t
care
what
others
thought
.
I
didn’t
think
that
my
voice
was
important
enough
for
it
to
be
heard
by
others
.
I
thought
I
had
nothing
new
or
interesting
to
contribute
.
.
The
few
times
I
had
tried
to
speak
,
no
one
listened
so
why
continue
without
an
audience
?
Too
often
speaking
felt
like
a
shout
into
the
void
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
felt
that
refusing
to
speak
invalidated
myself
and
my
struggles
and
experiences
,
by
simply
not
making
them
known
.
If
there
was
something
I
finally
wanted
to
speak
up
about
,
I
felt
like
I
couldn’t
because
I
hadn't
spoken
up
on
so
many
things
before
.
Why
now
all
of
a
sudden
?
I
felt
like
I
had
let
people
trample
over
me
for
so
long
by
not
expressing
my
opinions
.
I
wish
it
didn’t
happen
the
way
it
did
and
I
wish
it
was
more
on
my
own
terms
,
but
I
finally
let
all
the
barriers
down
when
someone
in
high
school
shook
me
to
my
core
with
their
utter
disrespect
for
my
lived
experience
.
When
that
happened
,
all
the
words
and
ideas
that
I
had
been
harboring
for
so
many
years
freed
themselves
into
the
air
and
the
ears
of
others
.
Now
I
occupy
space
,
because
I
deserve
it
.
I
deserve
to
have
people
listen
to
my
opinions
just
as
I
listen
to
theirs
.
I
don’t
have
to
sit
in
silence
while
others
choose
the
narrative
of
discussion
.
I
might
be
extremely
annoying
on
Twitter
now
,
but
I
feel
more
comfortable
stating
what’s
on
my
mind
even
if
there
is
nbsp
;
no
audience
.
Even
if
it’s
to
the
only
four
people
who
like
my
tweets
.
Someone
might
not
have
been
listening
then
,
but
who
knows
who
might
by
listening
tomorrow
,
nbsp
;
a
week
from
now
,
or
a
month
from
now
.

After
years
of
staying
silent
,
I
have
finally
found
the
ability
to
use
my
voice
.
I
can’t
stop
there
though
.
Like
others
have
paved
the
way
for
me
to
find
my
ability
to
speak
,
I
must
work
to
help
elevate
the
voices
of
others
,
so
that
people
feel
heard
and
that
their
experiences
are
validated
.
It’s
the
beginning
of
the
new
school
year
,
and
for
The
Chronicle
opinion
section
that
means
an
onslaught
of
patronizing
columns
directed
towards
first
years
written
by
people
vastly
unqualified
to
give
any
sort
of
life
advice
.
I
have
no
interest
in
reading
how
one
year
at
Duke
taught
you
the
importance
of
stress
management
or
how
it
took
time
for
you
to
make
this
new
environment
feel
like
a
home
.
I
don’t
need
a
thousand
words
to
tell
me
that
college
life
presents
you
with
a
lot
of
options
but
you
should
probably
only
commit
to
a
few
;
and
while
we’re
at
it
even
though
it’s
off
topic
I
may
as
well
mention
that
the
column
about
Radical
Randys
pissed
me
off
too
.
I’ve
been
here
for
three
years
now
and
I
still
feel
just
as
dumb
when
it
comes
to
navigating
this
school
as
I
was
in
my
first
week
.
I’ve
never
met
with
my
major
advisor
,
I’ve
never
set
up
a
Flunch
,
and
I
don’t
know
where
half
the
buildings
are
.
In
a
lot
of
ways
I’m
even
less
grounded
than
I
was
as
a
freshman
.
I
spent
a
good
year
and
a
half
caring
way
too
much
about
mixer
themes
or
who
was
bringing
who
to
date
functions
.
If
I
really
think
about
it
,
there’s
honestly
only
one
piece
of
advice
I
feel
completely
qualified
to
give
Don’t
eat
the
fish
in
West
Union
.
Last
week
I
made
the
poor
decision
of
purchasing
the
salmon
at
JB’s
Chop
House
and
it
only
took
a
few
short
hours
before
I
was
projectile
vomiting
into
the
drain
of
my
tub
shower
.
It
was
easily
the
third
worst
food
poisoning
I’ve
ever
encountered
,
topped
only
by
a
tainted
batch
of
Bojangles
purchased
in
Rougemont
,
North
Carolina
,
and
the
mayonnaise
topped
hamburger
I
ate
in
Damascus
,
Syria
.
It’s
not
the
first
time
I’ve
been
burned
by
JB’s
either
.
The
blackened
salmon
tip
pineapple
goulash
they
served
last
year
passed
through
my
system
quicker
than
Pete
Davidson
goes
through
hastily
chosen
girlfriends
.
But
let’s
not
just
pick
on
JB’s
.
Freshman
year
I
frequented
the
poke
stand
at
Ginger
and
Soy
;
however
,
after
biting
into
a
cartilage
chunk
the
size
of
Paul
Giamatti’s
left
testicle
for
the
third
time
,
I
decided
to
call
it
quits
.
The
sushi
place
whose
name
I
don’t
know
has
fish
,
but
they
also
think
that
cream
cheese
belongs
in
Japanese
inspired
cuisine
,
so
if
I
were
you
I’d
steer
clear
.
I
think
the
root
of
the
West
Union
fish
problem
is
really
just
an
identity
issue
.
West
Union
is
a
great
college
dining
hall
,
one
that
I’m
grateful
to
have
had
for
all
of
my
four
years
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
just
a
dining
hall
.
The
sleek
stand
facades
and
glass
architecture
give
the
vendors
the
confidence
to
attempt
dishes
they
have
no
business
attempting
.
It’s
kinda
like
how
that
doughy
white
guy
fiending
for
a
pickup
game
in
Wilson
thinks
he
can
take
pull
up
threes
just
because
he’s
rocking
a
newly
purchased
pair
of
Kyrie
5’s
.
You
can
peacock
all
you
want
but
you’re
not
fooling
anyone
after
you
start
gasping
for
air
three
trips
up
and
down
the
court
.
Prioritizing
the
brochure
over
user
experience
is
very
on
brand
for
Duke
.
The
quality
of
West
Union
food
isn’t
bad
,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
design
of
the
building
was
much
more
important
to
Duke
than
the
food
itself
.
Duke
got
rid
of
Central
Campus
because
it
looked
like
an
East
German
DMV
,
but
Central
was
super
fun
and
most
people
I
know
who
lived
there
loved
it
.
Duke
doesn’t
have
a
frat
row
and
any
on
campus
parties
are
strictly
monitored
,
but
that
just
makes
parties
move
off
campus
where
Duke
can
pawn
off
the
problem
onto
Durham
residents
and
the
local
police
.
Not
sure
what
any
of
that
really
has
to
do
with
West
Union
fish
but
I
have
to
write
another
hundred
words
for
The
Chronicle
to
publish
this
and
I’m
running
out
of
fish
jokes
faster
than
Pete
Davidson
goes
through
hastily
chosen
girlfriends
.
I
guess
I’ll
wrap
this
up
the
way
any
good
advice
column
does
with
an
unnecessary
and
overly
sentimental
restatement
of
my
simple
premise
.
Here
goes
nothing
Duke
can
be
a
hard
place
to
adjust
to
,
and
sometimes
you
may
feel
overly
stressed
or
like
you’re
missing
out
on
countless
opportunities
.
But
one
thing
you
should
miss
out
on
is
the
fish
in
West
Union
,
cause
that
s
will
destroy
your
insides
.
A
vital
part
of
the
college
experience
is
learning
to
understand
and
appreciate
different
perspectives
.
In
a
recent
column
,
Felicia
Chen
drew
on
her
involvement
with
the
International
Association
to
describe
challenges
that
international
students
face
,
drawing
comparisons
to
her
own
upbringing
in
North
Carolina
.
In
a
guest
column
response
,
Junette
Yu
took
issue
with
Felicia’s
characterizations
and
argued
that
the
international
student
experience
is
more
than
a
set
of
obstacles
.
As
president
of
the
International
Association
,
I
agree
that
it
is
valuable
to
broaden
the
scope
of
our
discussion
about
the
experiences
of
international
students
.
That’s
why
I’m
disappointed
to
find
that
Junette’s
response
contains
unnecessary
personal
attacks
that
detract
from
the
goal
of
bringing
nuanced
understanding
to
the
conversation
at
hand
.
Felicia’s
column
highlights
two
forms
of
work
authorization
that
together
present
a
lose
lose
situation
for
international
students
looking
for
work
experience
.
In
her
response
,
Junette
finds
that
Felicia’s
column
victimizes
international
students
who
worked
hard
for
the
opportunity
to
learn
at
Duke
.
Felicia’s
article
may
focus
too
narrowly
on
international
students
wishing
to
stay
in
the
US
,
and
as
Junette
points
out
,
this
may
exclude
international
students
with
different
goals
.
But
I
find
Junette’s
response
to
be
overly
personal
.
If
you
can
offer
only
pity
,
then
please
respectfully
stay
in
your
lane
,
Junette
writes
,
and
she
later
accuses
Felicia’s
column
of
being
either
egocentric
or
embarrassing
,
criticisms
that
are
at
best
unhelpful
.
Moreover
,
as
president
of
IA
,
I’ve
personally
worked
with
Felicia
to
resolve
the
CPT
crisis
of
this
summer
.
This
is
her
lane
too
.
Felicia’s
article
is
a
genuine
attempt
at
understanding
outside
perspectives
,
fostering
cross
cultural
dialogue
,
and
highlighting
persistent
issues
in
the
international
student
community
.
While
Junette
also
presents
valid
points
and
brings
needed
nuance
to
the
conversation
,
several
unnecessary
personal
attacks
close
off
further
discussion
.
In
an
already
contentious
debate
about
the
status
of
immigration
in
the
US
,
we
need
people
to
be
informed
about
and
engaged
with
the
issues
Felicia
addresses
.
As
president
of
IA
,
I
am
disappointed
to
lose
such
an
opportunity
for
mutual
understanding
to
a
petty
debate
around
character
and
motivation
.
My
life
can
be
characterized
by
the
30
mile
radius
around
Cary
,
North
Carolina
,
where
I
went
to
public
school
for
K
12
and
have
lived
in
the
same
house
forever
.
Perhaps
because
of
that
,
I
decided
to
join
Duke’s
International
Association
IA
during
the
end
of
my
freshman
year
.
By
now
,
I’m
used
to
the
shocked
looks
whenever
I
mention
my
involvement
.
underqualified
choice
to
speak
for
international
students
.
As
the
only
domestic
student
in
the
club
,
there
are
plenty
of
times
when
I’ve
felt
out
of
place
.
And
although
I’ve
sought
to
understand
the
perspective
of
being
a
foreigner
,
I
realize
now
that
there
are
aspects
of
the
international
student
experience
that
I’ll
never
be
able
to
replicate
.
A
couple
of
lessons
to
share
If
you
actually
sit
in
West
Union
,
you’ll
find
that
probably
half
of
the
conversations
around
you
are
about
recruiting
.
The
never
ending
grind
to
find
employment
is
a
constant
worry
among
Duke
students
.
The
difficulty
of
snagging
that
banking
gig
,
however
,
is
multiplied
if
you’re
international
.
In
order
to
work
in
the
United
States
,
international
students
who
are
typically
here
under
an
F1
visa
are
restricted
to
only
being
able
to
work
for
companies
that
will
sponsor
them
.
At
the
Duke
career
fair
last
year
,
there
were
a
whopping
22
employers
who
offered
sponsorship
.
To
make
matters
worse
,
the
amount
of
time
that
students
can
work
is
limited
.
Students
can
obtain
work
authorization
in
two
methods
OPT
Optional
Practical
Training
and
CPT
Curricular
Practical
Training
.
Deciding
which
type
of
authorization
to
use
can
be
another
perplexing
process
.
In
order
to
use
CPT
at
Duke
,
you’re
forced
to
pay
for
a
writing
class
over
the
summer
which
costs
3
,
492
.
It
may
seem
like
OPT
is
the
better
choice
but
OPT
takes
away
from
time
that
you
can
work
in
the
United
States
after
graduation
.
And
,
if
you’d
picked
OPT
this
summer
,
chances
are
you
that
you
would’ve
gotten
screwed
over
by
the
United
States
Citizenship
and
Immigration
Services
USCIS
.
Although
you’re
only
allowed
to
apply
for
OPT
90
days
before
the
end
of
the
school
year
,
the
average
processing
time
this
year
was
100
120
days
.
The
massive
delays
this
summer
meant
that
almost
40
international
students
were
at
risk
of
losing
their
internships
.
Then
there’s
the
simple
things
that
I
take
for
granted
.
If
I
want
,
I
can
drive
home
for
dinner
tonight
.
Others
have
to
sit
through
a
20
hour
long
plane
ride
to
see
their
parents
.
Even
having
a
place
to
go
back
too
isn’t
always
guaranteed
one
of
my
closest
friends
,
who
fled
to
boarding
school
in
India
during
the
Arab
Spring
,
confessed
to
me
that
there’s
no
place
for
him
that
equates
to
home
.
Another
friend
lives
in
Chennai
,
where
a
drought
has
left
millions
of
people
suffering
.
I
can
read
about
as
many
geopolitical
conflicts
as
I
want
,
but
I
will
never
know
what
it’s
like
to
grow
up
in
one
.
Given
that
about
11
percent
of
the
undergraduate
student
population
is
comprised
of
international
students
,
you’d
think
that
Duke
would
spend
enormous
amounts
of
resources
to
make
sure
they’re
supported
.
Yet
,
the
International
House
IHouse
remains
on
Central
Campus
while
everything
around
it
is
being
demolished
.
And
instead
of
writing
to
the
government
during
the
work
authorization
delays
this
summer
,
the
reason
that
students
lose
their
internships
was
because
they
were
forced
to
band
together
and
petition
administration
for
changes
.
Each
conversation
and
story
has
made
me
appreciate
the
boredom
of
North
Carolina
much
more
.
I’m
acutely
aware
that
I
can
see
my
family
whenever
I
want
,
and
that
I’ve
never
had
to
worry
about
being
kicked
out
of
the
country
.
Above
all
,
I’m
thankful
for
my
friends
for
sharing
their
stories
and
giving
me
a
glimpse
of
what
it
means
to
be
international
.
Facebook
may
lead
you
to
believe
that
all
international
students
are
stupidly
rich
,
but
the
cost
of
being
international
is
much
higher
than
you’d
think
.
I
had
a
celery
.
There
are
some
uncommon
ones
,
I’ll
grant
you
that
.
But
these
recipes
are
some
of
the
greatest
measures
of
her
life
,
and
right
now
I
want
to
make
them
all
.

As
I
walked
out
of
Wallace
Wade
Saturday
night
,
skin
still
prickly
from
drying
tears
,
I
thought
about
Nana’s
legacies
her
family
,
her
paintings
and
the
box
of
her
recipes
in
my
mom’s
kitchen
,
copied
onto
index
cards
in
her
scribbled
cursive
.
There
had
been
a
beautiful
sunset
,
followed
by
a
gentle
moonrise
into
the
dusky
lavender
sky
.
Duke
won
the
game
,
which
would
have
made
Papaw
a
diehard
UK
fan
turn
in
his
grave
but
still
felt
like
a
sign
of
good
things
to
come
.
I
had
a
lemonade
in
my
hand
and
friends
at
my
side
.
And
somewhere
,
as
the
first
stars
were
making
their
appearance
,
I
know
that
Nana
was
sharing
a
meal
and
a
dance
with
the
love
of
her
life
.
I’m
white
.
I’ve
lived
in
my
white
body
for
22
years
.
And
it
took
me
until
recently
to
actually
realize
what
that
means
.
I
grew
up
in
the
North
Shore
of
Chicago
,
one
of
the
whitest
spaces
in
one
of
the
country’s
most
segregated
cities
.
My
public
high
school’s
racial
makeup
was
over
90
percent
white
and
less
than
one
percent
black
.
Because
everyone
around
me
was
white
,
whiteness
seemed
unremarkable
.
I
understood
being
white
as
something
like
a
blank
slate
,
the
status
quo
,
the
absence
of
race
.
Whiteness
,
to
me
,
was
invisible
,
making
color
a
mark
of
otherness
.
Nonetheless
,
I
was
not
completely
ignorant
I
knew
a
bit
about
the
racism
that
made
my
town
the
white
space
that
it
was
.
I
knew
that
blackness
was
largely
disallowed
,
especially
in
my
area
.
However
,
I
did
not
understand
the
critical
role
that
my
personal
whiteness
played
in
all
this
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
disallowance
of
blackness
lies
the
affirmation
of
whiteness
.
Coming
to
Duke
,
I
was
surrounded
by
much
more
diversity
.
Even
so
,
my
conceptualization
of
whiteness
remained
unshaken
.
Despite
Duke’s
relative
diversity
,
it
is
an
inherently
white
space
,
as
prestigious
universities
tend
to
be
.
Universities
,
aside
from
HBCUs
Historically
Black
Colleges
and
Universities
,
tend
to
be
centers
and
reproducers
of
whiteness
.
At
Duke
,
we
see
this
in
the
majority
white
student
body
,
the
majority
white
faculty
and
professors
,
the
majority
white
authors
we
read
in
class
;
at
the
heart
of
academia
lies
whiteness
.
Moreover
,
we
also
see
the
majority
white
faculty
juxtaposed
with
the
majority
black
staff
.
Within
a
white
space
,
I
fit
right
in
and
remained
unaware
of
my
whiteness
.
While
I
considered
myself
an
activist
,
I
still
did
not
fully
understand
how
my
whiteness
played
into
the
picture
.
Here’s
an
example
during
my
sophomore
year
,
Duke
NAACP
National
Association
for
the
Advancement
of
Colored
People
had
an
opening
for
one
of
their
executive
positions
.
The
role
had
similar
requirements
to
that
of
my
Duke
Red
Cross
Executive
Position
,
so
I
thought
I’d
be
good
for
the
role
and
I
applied
.
It
was
not
until
my
interview
that
I
realized
my
ignorance
in
applying
.
I
was
being
interviewed
by
two
black
women
and
the
woman
who
came
in
after
me
appeared
to
be
a
woman
of
color
.
These
were
people
who
understood
what
it
is
like
to
be
a
woman
of
color
,
people
who
should
be
leading
the
NAACP
movement
on
Duke’s
campus
.
Why
,
as
a
white
woman
,
would
I
know
what’s
best
for
a
group
of
people
of
color
?
Being
a
woke
,
educated
white
woman
,
studying
issues
of
race
in
school
and
being
an
activist
led
me
to
believe
that
I
understood
on
some
level
people
of
color’s
experiences
.
The
reality
is
that
I
didn’t
,
and
as
a
white
person
,
I
will
never
fully
understand
.
Within
a
movement
I
cannot
fully
understand
,
I
should
listen
and
help
where
I
can
,
not
try
to
lead
the
movement
.
In
this
situation
,
I
should
have
just
been
a
part
of
the
general
body
.
Rather
,
the
whiteness
that
constantly
reminds
me
that
I
am
intelligent
and
valuable
and
even
that
I
know
what
marginalized
communities
need
wrongly
affirmed
my
applying
for
a
role
that
I
had
no
business
applying
for
.
It
goes
without
saying
that
I
did
not
get
the
position
.
Moreover
,
a
few
weeks
ago
with
my
BassConnections
team
,
I
participated
in
an
activity
where
a
statement
is
read
and
we
choose
a
corner
of
the
room
that
represented
one
of
the
following
answers
strongly
agree
,
agree
,
disagree
,
strongly
disagree
.
One
of
the
statements
presented
was
Systemic
racism
affects
me
every
day
.
I
moved
to
the
strongly
agree
corner
of
the
room
and
found
myself
in
a
group
with
over
ten
black
people
and
one
other
white
woman
.
When
discussing
why
we
chose
this
corner
,
the
black
people
in
the
group’s
answers
almost
went
without
saying
.
Like
,
Heads
turned
to
me
to
ask
why
I
was
there
.
How
as
a
white
person
,
does
systemic
racism
affect
my
daily
life
?
The
reality
is
that
systemic
racism
affects
me
positively
every
day
.
It
has
provided
me
the
privilege
that
created
a
pathway
to
Duke
.
It
affirms
that
I
deserve
to
be
where
I
am
.
It
lets
me
live
without
fear
of
police
and
authority
.
It
allows
me
to
take
up
space
.
It
affirms
my
opinions
are
valid
even
when
they
aren’t
.
It’s
a
catalyst
for
people
to
make
positive
assumptions
about
me
.
It
is
the
reason
that
I
never
even
have
to
think
about
my
race
.
Not
having
to
think
about
my
race
as
I
move
through
spaces
is
one
of
the
greatest
privileges
.
Often
,
it
is
hard
to
conceptualize
the
absence
of
something
,
such
as
the
absence
of
racism
towards
white
people
.
This
contributes
to
our
low
awareness
,
as
white
people
,
of
the
privileges
that
we
carry
in
every
space
.
As
a
white
person
,
the
most
critical
thing
you
can
do
is
be
aware
of
our
whiteness
and
the
way
that
it
affects
our
daily
life
as
well
as
the
lives
of
others
.
This
means
applying
a
racial
lens
to
the
world
around
you
,
because
being
color
blind
means
being
ignorant
to
a
world
structured
by
racism
.
Lastly
,
I
believe
that
our
role
as
white
people
is
largely
to
listen
,
not
to
take
up
more
space
than
we
already
do
.
To
listen
to
movements
,
to
learn
how
to
participate
.
To
listen
to
people
of
color’s
lived
experiences
.
To
stop
talking
and
just
listen
.
This
weekend
I
did
what
I
do
best
.
I
watched
the
global
climate
strike
from
the
apathy
of
my
phone
screen
.
I
woke
up
on
Friday
morning
and
lay
in
bed
,
brain
hazy
with
sleep
.
I
fixed
a
dead
stare
at
my
Instagram
feed
,
as
I
do
most
mornings
,
and
scrolled
to
infinity
until
I
felt
tired
again
.
The
strike
was
everywhere
.
Protestors
waved
funny
signs
that
were
actually
terrifying
and
apocalyptic

It’s
hard
not
to
smile
when
a
little
kid
with
big
round
eyes
carries
a
sign
that
reads
Don’t
Mess
With
My
Future
,
this
was
also
one
of
Thunberg’s
sternly
delivered
directives
during
her
UN
speech
this
weekend
.
Thunberg
is
kid
teen
young
adult
with
big
,
round
,
fearful
eyes
.
It’s
probably
evolutionary
instinct
that
compels
me
to
coo
at
any
child
holding
a
sign
bigger
than
herself
,
regardless
of
the
fact
that
she
holds
a
sign
prophesying
the
end
of
the
world
.
Donald
Trump
did
it
just
the
other
day
,
calling
Thunberg
a
very
happy
young
girl
,
and
came
under
fire
for
being
extremely
condescending
.
Soon
after
,
Thunberg
changed
her
Twitter
bio
to
mock
Trump’s
rhetoric
.
We
have
turned
to
round
eyed
young
people
for
hope
in
a
time
where
hope
seems
to
be
at
an
all
time
low
political
stalemate
,
uncontrollable
gun
violence
,
border
crisis
,
climate
catastrophe
.
It
is
redemptive
to
see
hordes
of
children
who
want
to
save
the
planet
.
They’re
lights
for
dark
times
.
Yet
it
is
unfair
to
lean
on
children
for
a
climate
crisis
that
was
created
by
adults
and
whose
solutions
require
the
immediate
attention
of
adults
.
Capitalizing
children
and
their
innocence
to
appeal
to
policymakers
just
might
work
the
image
of
young
people
dying
might
be
desperate
enough
to
finally
incite
reformation
but
it
also
doesn’t
feel
entirely
right
.
Maybe
that’s
the
point
.
I’m
conflicted
about
the
,
well
,
childlike
rhetoric
that
was
brought
to
the
protests
.
In
a
VICE
video
titled
These
Climate
Strike
Kids
Will
Restore
Your
Hope
In
Humanity
,
nine
year
old
Luka
Cavelli
says
,
I
wish
we
had
more
solar
panels
instead
of
fossil
fuels
or
electricity
.
Because
those
come
from
factories
and
factories
make
these
gases
that
aren’t
good
for
the
hemisphere
.
The
linearity
of
thought
is
illusory
for
a
second
,
it
feels
like
the
solution
is
that
easy
.
And
maybe
hemisphere
is
close
enough
to
atmosphere
to
give
the
kid
a
pass
.
But
the
truth
is
that
Greta
Thunberg
is
exceptional
in
her
awareness
and
her
elocution
.
For
every
child
who
knows
the
difference
between
the
hemisphere
and
the
atmosphere
at
age
nine
,
there
are
many
more
who
do
not
.
For
every
adult
who
believes
in
climate
action
,
there
are
many
more
who
do
not
.
And
above
all
,
it
is
Goliath
who
damages
the
environment

Big

Big

Young
people
were
the
ones
throwing
stones
into
the
eye
of
the
giant
last
weekend
.
It
was
a
spectacle
,
definitely
,
but
whether
to
feel
hopeful
or
disquieted
,
I’m
not
sure
yet
.
I
don’t
think
the
answer
is
clear
.
Posing
kids
many
of
whom
who
have
a
simplified
understanding
of
the
stakes
of
their
protest
next
to
the
imminent
end
of
the
world
made
the
climate
strikes
last
weekend
grotesque
.
An
estimated
four
million
protestors
marched
last
weekend
,
the
largest
climate
protest
in
history
.
Just
the
fact
that
the
strikes
happened
is
extraordinary
.
And
yet
,
I
imagine
the
enormous
pile
of
paper
waste
that
came
from
making
those
signs
,
of
the
toxins
in
those
colorful
markers
and
the
cars
stalled
in
traffic
to
make
space
for
protestors
.
If
I
continue
along
my
own
fatalism
and
indulge
irony
,
I
imagine
that
the
protestors
who
skipped
school
to
march
might’ve
driven
home
,
ordered
takeout
delivered
to
them
in
styrofoam
containers
,
taken
a
long
shower
,
forgotten
to
turn
off
the
light
in
the
bathroom
.
I’m
thinking
about
these
things
because
I
am
just
as
guilty
.
Of
walking
through
West
Union
in
a
half
hearted
attempt
to
find
a
non
plastic
fork
and
giving
up
.
Of
Ubering
off
campus
because
walking
is
inconvenient
.
Of
prioritizing
my
own
comfort
,
almost
always
.
This
guilt
reminds
me
of
the
saying
that
death
is
a
side
effect
of
living
.
It’s
impossible
to
exist
in
the
modern
world
without
damaging
the
environment
.
I
wonder
what
it
would
be
like
to
shirk
hope
for
a
more
nihilistic
view
the
world
is
definitely
ending
.
Nope
.
Despite
my
criticism
,
I
am
still
hopeful
.
It’s
a
childlike
hope
I
carry
as
we
enter
the
sixth
mass
extinction
.
But
practically
,
there
are
only
two
options
to
have
hope
or
to
not
have
hope
.
Both
are
delusional
in
their
own
ways
,
but
a
choice
between
the
two
should
be
made
.
Choose
whichever
one
compels
you
to
act
.
Last
summer
,
I
listened
to
this
TED
Radio
Hour
on
the
climate
crisis
,
I
heard
something
that
has
helped
sustain
my
hope
To
those
who
despair
.
.
.
that
your
limited
actions
on
their
own
won’t
solve
global
warming
,
I
say
don’t
let
the
perfect
be
the
enemy
of
the
good
.
I’m
trying
to
eat
less
meat
.
I
started
following
futureearth
,
a
cool
Instagram
account
that
explains
the
climate
crisis
through
infographics
.
I
walked
past
a
piece
of
trash
on
the
ground
the
other
day
,
stopped
and
thought
for
a
second
,
walked
back
,
picked
it
up
,
and
threw
it
in
the
garbage
.
Nothing
to
rave
about
,
but
the
world
doesn’t
need
to
be
definitely
ending
in
order
for
us
to
start
caring
for
it
.
And
last
night
,
I
watched
the
stars
in
an
open
roofed
barn
off
campus
.
The
only
time
I’ve
seen
the
entire
galaxy
was
the
summer
I
went
to
the
Amazon
rainforest
,
which
is
on
fire
right
now
.
It’s
freaky
how
brilliant
the
night
sky
can
be
when
there
is
no
light
pollution
,
and
I
don’t
know
when
I
will
ever
have
that
sky
again
.
But
last
night
,
I
could
see
Jupiter
a
bright
dot
at
the
center
of
my
view
.
As
Drill
Sergeant
paced
through
our
formation
,
peering
into
the
stationary
eyes
of
the
assembled
Cadets
,
he
periodically
barked
Thinkin’
and
blinkin’
Cadets
!
That
is
move
at
the
position
of
attention
.
For
the
duration
of
the
command
,
you
are
the
personification
of
a
wood
two
by
four
.
Mastering
the
position
of
attention
requires
acute
attention
to
detail
.
Attention
to
detail
because
Drill
Sergeants
are
constantly
playing
a
game
of
Where’s
Waldo
.
Except
in
this
version
,
Waldo
does
lots
of
pushups
upon
his
unfortunate
discovery
.
As
we
stood
in
formation
,
Drill
Sergeants
would
patrol
the
perimeter
searching
for
that
one
dreaded
individual
,
that
lone
Cadet
who
dared
defile
the
integrity
of
the
formation
with
their
lackadaisical
arrogance
.
If
we
we’re
all
paying
close
attention
to
detail
,
then
the
Drill
Sergeant
would
abandon
his
search
unsatisfied
.
And
if
just
one
person
was
not
?
Pushups
for
all
.
The
position
of
attention
also
requires
great
discipline
.
The
type
of
discipline
that
allows
you
to
ignore
the
need
to
scratch
your
head
because
there’s
an
itch
or
shift
your
posture
because
your
hips
are
uncomfortable
.
Army
discipline
teaches
you
to
ignore
the
because
and
focus
intently
on
the
validity
of
the
action
in
question
is
this
allowed
right
now
?
At
the
position
of
attention
,
the
answer
is
always
no
.
Frequently
,
Drill
Sergeant
would
bark
,
It
is
physically
impossible
to
move
at
the
position
of
attention
!
and
sometimes
,
in
my
cheekier
moments
,
I
would
think
to
myself
,
Well
that’s
not
literally
true
,
I
could
move
my
arm
right
now
if
I
wanted
to
.
But
after
plenty
of
punitive
pushups
,
I
smothered
my
inner
brat
and
treated
Drill
Sergeant’s
statement
like
the
second
coming
of
2
2
4
.
Once
,
I
was
standing
at
attention
in
the
front
row
of
the
formation
.
Before
me
,
a
female
Drill
Sergeant
sat
on
a
camp
stool
surveying
the
Cadets
before
her
.
Suddenly
,
with
an
intent
look
upon
her
face
,
in
a
calm
voice
,
she
said
Cadet
Becker
,
find
your
peace
at
the
position
of
attention
.
If
I
could
,
I
would
have
scrunched
my
face
in
confusion
.
Find
my
peace
?
I
was
simply
trying
to
find
my
anonymity
!
In
that
moment
,
my
only
desire
was
not
to
be
singled
out
for
a
silly
mistake
that
would
bring
the
pain
down
on
everyone
else
.
In
the
same
steady
tone
,
she
instructed
me
to
relax
in
position
,
let
the
tension
in
your
body
release
,
and
breathe
in
through
your
mouth
and
out
through
your
nose
.
For
a
few
minutes
I
stood
there
,
breathing
in
and
out
to
the
rhythm
of
her
steady
cadence
.
Slowly
,
I
quieted
my
thoughts
and
focused
on
maintaining
an
even
pace
of
breath
.
Almost
without
my
noticing
,
the
paranoia
of
being
singled
out
faded
away
.
There
you
go
,
Cadet
.
Now
just
remember
to
keep
your
hands
fixed
to
your
trousers
and
you’ll
have
it
almost
perfect
.
I
had
found
my
peace
at
the
position
of
attention
.
At
the
graduation
ceremony
on
the
final
day
of
Basic
Camp
we
stood
fast
at
the
position
of
attention
for
nearly
twenty
minutes
straight
.
When
I
first
arrived
at
Fort
Knox
,
standing
at
attention
for
that
amount
of
time
would
have
been
unbearable
.
I
would
have
been
distracted
by
a
thousand
different
inconveniences
from
my
parched
mouth
to
the
itch
in
the
small
of
my
back
.
But
after
31
days
of
training
,
I
had
learned
better
than
to
fixate
on
such
nuisances
.
I
had
developed
a
measure
of
discipline
over
body
and
mind
.
So
,
once
more
,
I
assumed
the
position
of
attention
.
I
took
a
deep
breath
and
turned
my
animated
limbs
into
iron
rods
.
I
aligned
my
hands
with
the
seams
of
my
trousers
and
placed
my
feet
at
neat
,
45
degree
angles
.
Finally
,
I
moved
my
head
and
eyes
forward
and
fixed
my
gaze
on
a
tree
in
the
distance
.
nbsp
;
Having
assumed
the
position
of
attention
properly
,
I
stood
there
doing
nothing
besides
thinkin’
and
blinkin’
.
You
haven’t
met
Professor
Melissa
Malouf
until
you’ve
met
her
house
.
The
fiction
writer
has
colored
herself
into
the
place
like
an
abstract
artist
composes
a
self
portrait
;
its
appointments
are
vibrant
and
unrestrained
,
personal
,
jolly
in
the
utmost
.
The
front
door
is
hot
pink
.
In
the
kitchen
,
she
picks
colors
out
of
her
greenish
rainbow
linoleum
flooring
and
throws
them
about
the
room
into
plates
,
wallpaper
,
those
armchairs
she
pulled
off
the
street
and
reupholstered
.
A
coil
of
Christmas
lights
twinkles
in
the
fireplace
like
it’s
the
portal
to
a
fairy
world
.
I
first
visited
the
Malouf
cottage
on
Monmouth
Ave
.
two
years
ago
during
our
fiction
class’s
holiday
fête
.
A
few
weeks
back
,
I
was
her
partyguest
again
when
the
topic
of
conversation
turned
to
her
spring
retirement
date
.
In
the
kaleidoscope
kitchen
,
I
wondered
aloud
whether
I’d
ever
see
the
place
again
.
She
asked
if
I
might
like
to
come
over
and
cook
sometime
and
,
oh
,
had
I
ever
tried
her
pancake
soufflé
?
When
we
walk
through
that
pink
front
door
,
the
air
is
thick
already
with
the
smell
of
hot
butter
,
made
fuller
by
a
note
of
nutmeg
.
Malouf
,
the
consummate
hostess
,
has
set
a
gorgeous
spread
before
us
bowls
of
fresh
berries
,
orange
juice
and
stunningly
craggy
in
a
cast
iron
skillet
the
pancake
soufflé
itself
,
which
turns
out
to
be
a
Dutch
Baby

It
looks
like
a
crater
on
Mars
,
she
says
.
She
cuts
three
pieces
,
produces
a
bowl
of
warm
syrup
Ladies
,
.
So
that’s
just
been
a
real
gift
to
me
,
really
great
.
It’s
all
part
of
a
long
conversation
you’re
dipping
your
oar
into
the
whole
river
,
going
back
as
far
as
your
reading
goes
back
.
So
I
could
write
something
like
Alas
,
poor
Margot
’
in
a
short
story
and
participate
in
that
tradition
.
Experience
bioluminescence
.
It’s
really
important
.
Take
her
word
for
that
one
.
And
before
we
go
,
here’s
the
recipe
,
which
Malouf
has
been
making
since
1966
.
It’s
simple
;
we
got
it
together
well
enough
even
while
dreaming
of
a
sinuous
Tommy
Thompson
of
butter
in
a
12
inch
skillet
.
When
all
that
fat
is
piping
hot
,
pour
in
your
batter
carefully
!
and
slide
the
thing
into
the
oven
at
425
.
15
20
minutes
later
,
it’s
puffed
to
new
heights
and
golden
brown
.
Remove
,
and
top
it
as
you
like
.
We’re
sure
you
won’t
forget
to
heat
your
syrup
.
The
political
discord
at
Duke
and
in
America’s
body
politic
more
broadly
is
plagued
by
Radical
Randys’
.
These
political
extremists
dominate
the
conversation
both
on
campus
and
on
the
airwaves
of
cable
TV
,
whether
it
be
Fox
News
or
MSNBC
,
as
they
appeal
to
only
their
own
tribe
of
ideological
followers
who
share
their
respective
world
views
.
These
radicals
have
little
to
no
interest
in
cooperating
with
their
opponents
on
the
other
side
of
the
aisle
,
much
less
arguments
and
facts
that
run
contrary
to
their
own
.
Instead
,
such
activists
are
more
interested
in
chastising
those
with
differing
points
of
view
in
order
to
signal
their
own
virtue
and
ideological
purity
.
Examples
of
this
abound
,
but
two
notable
cases
include
the
recent
trend
within
the
Republican
party
of
maligning
its
more
moderate
members
as
RINOS
Republicans
in
Name
Only
for
not
holding
hardline
positions
.
The
embrace
of
extremism
can
also
be
seen
within
the
Democratic
party
as
current
2020
candidates
who
do
not
endorse
Medicare
for
All
a
policy
position
that
would
have
been
unthinkable
even
a
decade
ago
are
targeted
by
their
more
radical
primary
opponents
.
Meanwhile
,
the
political
center
of
American
politics
moderate
Democrats
and
Republicans
inclined
to
compromise
has
steadily
eroded
.
Far
from
a
trendy
ideology
,
centrism
is
increasingly
rare
.
Unfortunately
,
a
recent
column
by
our
friend
David
Min
only
exacerbated
this
phenomenon
.
Min’s
misguided
understanding
of
centrism
is
not
unique
,
as
various
columnists
,
Twitter
pundits
,
and
even
a
popular
sub
Reddit
all
perpetuate
a
strawman
like
caricature
of
Centrist
Chads
.
Yet
centrism
is
not
for
the
politically
apathetic
,
and
it
certainly
is
not
limited
to
those
of
privilege
.
Moreover
,
true
centrism
does
not
extol
moderation
as
a
virtue
worth
pursuing
for
its
own
sake
which
,
as
Min
correctly
points
out
,
would
be
fallacious
.
Instead
,
centrism
recognizes
that
one
ideology
does
not
hold
a
monopoly
on
the
truth
;
that
equally
qualified
scholars
and
rational
policymakers
often
reach
opposing
conclusions
.
This
distinction
is
best
demonstrated
through
application
.
For
example
,
Min
insinuates
that
it
is
ideologically
inconsistent
to
both
believe
in
the
tangible
legacy
of
racism
and
oppose
government
reparations
.
These
two
things
are
not
mutually
exclusive
,
and
he
ignores
the
well
studied
challenges
associated
with
creating
effective
reparations
programs
that
create
long
term
,
cross
generational
changes
in
racial
economic
disparities
.
Perhaps
calls
to
study
the
issue
further
aren’t
a
soft
left
cop
out
and
are
instead
an
honest
recognition
that
the
research
is
too
inconclusive
to
propose
a
sweeping
policy
change
.
Likewise
,
Min
argues
that
the
middle
ground
on
climate
change
is
incoherent
.
However
,
he
fails
to
consider
the
fact
that
it
is
possible
to
simultaneously
recognize
the
harsh
consequences
of
climate
change
without
supporting
radical
policies
like
the
Green
New
Deal
.
Perhaps
the
steep
costs
of
such
programs
don’t
return
commensurate
benefits
,
and
we
can
ameliorate
most
of
the
damage
of
climate
change
with
more
moderate
and
less
disruptive
solutions
such
as
carbon
taxes
or
a
cap
and
trade
system
.
On
issues
ranging
from
reparations
to
climate
change
to
Israel
,
Min
consistently
fails
to
recognize
other
legitimate
viewpoints
,
prioritizes
ideological
purity
,
and
assumes
that
his
side
has
all
of
the
correct
answers
.
In
contrast
,
it
is
centrism
,
political
moderation
and
compromise
that
hold
the
promise
of
both
affecting
the
most
change
and
improving
the
quality
of
our
political
discourse
.
Our
federal
government
was
designed
with
its
separate
legislative
chambers
,
presidential
vetoes
,
and
judicial
review
to
facilitate
slow
,
steady
,
and
well
reasoned
legislative
development
rather
than
sweeping
knee
jerk
changes
.
It
should
be
clear
that
the
calls
of
the
Radical
Randys’
are
not
only
flawed
on
their
own
merits
but
that
they
are
also
antithetical
to
our
very
form
of
government
.
While
politicians
are
rewarded
at
the
ballot
box
for
their
demagoguery
and
impractical
promises
,
our
actual
institutions
of
governance
reward
policymakers
who
compromise
and
pursue
moderate
stances
.
For
instance
,
GovTrack
grades
Senator
Bernie
Sanders
as
one
of
the
most
ideologically
pure
and
the
furthest
left
of
all
sitting
senators
.
Yet
Sanders’
leadership
score
a
proxy
metric
for
legislative
effectiveness
is
one
of
the
lowest
.
By
contrast
,
Senators
Amy
Klobuchar
and
Susan
Collins
,
whose
ideologies
align
with
the
center
left
and
center
right
respectively
,
have
two
of
the
highest
leadership
scores
.
Examples
like
this
are
abundant
and
raise
an
important
question
outside
of
some
illusory
moral
high
ground
,
what
is
the
virtue
in
ideological
purity
if
it
fails
to
yield
tangible
policy
results
?
Perhaps
President
Clinton
captured
this
reality
best
when
he
remarked
that
Politics
is
the
art
of
the
possible
,
not
the
ideal
.
Although
Radical
Randys’
dominate
discussions
with
talk
of
big
structural
change
or
wholesale
swamp
draining
,
their
rhetoric
and
actions
are
typically
impractical
,
counterproductive
and
alienate
others
.
In
contrast
,
centrism
and
compromise
,
by
design
,
work
well
within
our
political
system
and
typically
result
in
tangible
progress
.
Centrism
has
the
additional
benefit
of
remedying
some
of
the
tribal
hostility
currently
in
place
.
Indeed
,
common
sense
,
open
mindedness
,
and
cheerful
stoicism
are
the
foundations
of
centrism
and
result
in
not
only
good
policy
decisions
but
ample
allowance
for
the
views
of
others
.
I
read
with
interest
your
story
on
the
removal
of
Untitled
1
.
nbsp
;
It
made
me
recall
a
situation
during
my
tenure
as
Business
Manager
of
the
Chronicle
in
1966
67
.
nbsp
;
A
new
art
exhibit
on
campus
included
a
painting
of
an
abstract
,
but
anatomically
correct
,
female
nude
.
nbsp
;
The
Duke
administration
quickly
removed
the
painting
,
but
not
before
an
alert
Chronicle
photographer
captured
the
image
.
nbsp
;
Of
course
Editor
Dave
Birkhead
ran
it
on
the
front
page
of
the
next
issue
.
nbsp
;
I
was
called
to
the
office
of
the
Dean
of
Students
and
informed
that
the
Durham
ladies
who
ran
the
Addressograph
machines
had
refused
to
process
this
issue
for
mailing
to
our
paid
subscribers
,
because
of
this
obscenity
.
Ah
,
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
a
Chronicle
Business
Manager
.
Traveling
as
a
black
woman
is
a
unique
experience
.
I
recently
visited
a
country
that
was
a
lot
whiter
than
the
United
States
and
whose
black
population
was
less
than
one
percent
.
I
was
surrounded
almost
exclusively
by
white
people
.
I
noticed
them
and
they
noticed
me
.
They
noticed
me
.
Everywhere
I
went
I
was
being
looked
at
,
stared
at
.
People
were
x
raying
me
with
their
eyes
on
the
subway
,
on
the
street
,
on
the
bus
,
in
restaurants
,
in
stores
.
Everywhere
I
went
I
was
followed
by
an
unfamiliar
gaze
.
I
stood
out
.
I
was
hypervisible
.
And
it
didn’t
feel
good
.
I
felt
like
a
test
subject
in
a
lab
.
Like
a
show
being
watched
.
Like
I
was
a
new
species
that
they
were
discovering
.
Back
home
in
the
United
States
I
am
also
hypervisible
,
but
in
a
different
way
.
I
usually
don’t
elicit
stares
because
someone
hasn’t
seen
or
interacted
with
black
people
before
.
I
nbsp
;
always
feel
seen
and
watched
though
.
Every
move
I
make
feels
critiqued
and
scrutinized
.
If
I
speak
too
loud
or
get
too
angry
,
I
am
branded
the
angry
black
woman’
.
My
natural
hair
or
protective
styles
are
often
deemed
unprofessional
.
My
resting
face
is
seen
as
a
threat
.
I
strike
fear
in
the
hearts
of
middle
aged
white
women
clutching
their
bags
everytime
I
enter
within
a
thirty
foot
radius
of
them
.
Because
of
my
hypervisibility
I
have
to
take
precautions
that
other
people
don’t
.
I
became
aware
that
I
would
need
to
move
around
differently
in
the
sixth
grade
.
I
was
going
to
the
local
grocery
store
nbsp
;
after
school
with
some
of
my
friends
.
We
were
hungry
and
wanted
to
get
the
59
cent
dollars
the
store
offered
.
It
being
after
school
,
we
all
had
our
backpacks
on
.
The
four
of
us
walked
in
and
began
heading
to
the
pastry
section
when
a
security
guard
told
me
I
had
to
leave
my
bag
at
the
front
.
My
friends
asked
if
they
had
to
give
their
bags
too
.
No
just
her
the
guard
said
.
There
was
no
fear
of
theft
from
the
non
black
kids
in
my
group
.
It
was
only
meant
for
me
,
the
small
black
girl
whose
backpack
was
so
full
she
couldn’t
have
stolen
anything
if
she
nbsp
;
wanted
to
.
I
told
my
friends
I
was
just
going
to
head
home
,
that
I
wasn’t
that
hungry
anymore
.
I
left
the
store
.
I
thought
about
my
experience
the
whole
walk
home
,
but
didn’t
tell
my
mom
until
two
years
ago
when
I
walked
into
Harris
Teeter
during
the
first
couple
weeks
of
school
at
Duke
,
with
my
backpack
on
and
heart
beating
out
of
my
chest
for
fear
that
I
would
be
told
to
turn
around
,
or
leave
my
backpack
with
a
guard
.
No
one
told
me
anything
and
I
did
my
shopping
with
friends
,
but
not
without
the
constant
fear
that
I
would
be
reprimanded
.
From
now
on
,
I
walk
in
the
middle
aisles
of
stores
away
from
the
products
on
the
shelves
,
I
keep
my
hands
away
from
my
pockets
,
I
walk
slowly
,
as
to
not
have
someone
believe
I
am
stealing
for
the
sole
reason
that
I
am
black
.
Let’s
not
even
get
started
about
the
panic
that
rushes
through
my
body
when
I
see
a
police
officer
.
At
the
same
time
,
even
when
a
blinding
light
is
being
shone
on
every
part
of
my
existence
,
I
feel
nbsp
;
invisible
and
unseen
.
My
words
nbsp
;
aren’t
afforded
the
same
weight
as
those
of
my
white
counterparts
.
An
idea
isn’t
deemed
interesting
if
it
comes
out
of
my
mouth
,
but
let
it
be
another
person
and
you’d
think
they
found
out
the
key
to
traveling
at
the
speed
of
light
.
People
don’t
ask
for
my
opinions
.
They
assume
them
,
or
assume
I
have
none
.
I
am
oftentimes
the
last
person
in
a
group
to
be
addressed
.
I
don’t
feel
like
I
belong
.
People
expect
me
to
move
out
of
the
way
for
them
,
when
we’re
on
a
crowded
sidewalk
.
My
hypervisibility
and
invisibility
are
not
only
physical
,
but
mental
and
emotional
.
It
is
not
possible
for
me
to
solely
exist
.
Everywhere
I
go
I
am
both
ignored
and
overly
acknowledged
.
I
have
to
think
twice
,
three
times
about
the
things
I
do
and
how
I
do
them
.
I
have
to
be
a
little
more
vigilant
,
a
little
more
observant
.
Ready
to
change
at
a
moment’s
notice
so
I
do
not
put
myself
in
a
troubling
situation
.
The
light
of
the
sun
shines
on
me
,
but
the
shadows
it
creates
hide
me
,
and
through
that
I
have
to
find
a
way
to
exist
,
to
keep
being
me
,
and
to
not
change
who
I
am
on
the
inside
.
I
think
we
have
forgotten
who
we
are
as
Asian
Americans
.
The
conversations
that
I
have
with
my
East
Asian
parents
and
peers
about
topics
like
immigration
and
race
in
the
United
States
not
only
disappoint
me
but
also
lead
me
to
believe
that
we
are
either
purposefully
or
subconsciously
attempting
to
shed
our
status
as
perpetually
foreign
as
a
means
to
achieve
honorary
Whiteness
.
To
make
it
to
positions
of
power
and
even
to
get
to
Duke
University
we
,
to
some
extent
,
adapted
ourselves
to
the
confines
and
customs
of
Western
culture
,
often
with
the
understanding
that
we
can
only
succeed
by
keeping
our
heads
down
.
Our
parents
and
popular
discourse
sold
us
on
the
vision
of
assimilation
as
the
goal
of
racial
politics
only
achievable
through
stoic
patience
,
political
obedience
and
self
improvement
.
These
virtues
aren’t
inherently
wrong
but
have
become
weaponized
to
place
the
burden
of
inequality
on
the
oppressed
;
they
obfuscate
our
understanding
of
the
legacy
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
United
States
by
shifting
the
discussion
to
an
issue
of
family
values
and
education
and
away
from
slavery
,
Jim
Crow
,
the
war
on
drugs
and
mass
incarceration
.
There
nevertheless
exists
a
pervasive
understanding
of
Asians
as
the
Model
Minority
and
that
this
myth
was
propagated
solely
by
White
supremacist
structures
.
However
,
it’s
harder
to
admit
that
we
as
Asians
often
benefit
from
such
stereotypes
and
even
perpetuate
them
.
We
seldom
have
to
worry
about
being
stopped
and
frisked
by
a
police
officer
,
faced
with
housing
or
loan
discrimination
,
or
people
thinking
that
we
don’t
belong
at
elite
universities
.
Asians
accept
and
even
relish
in
stereotypes
about
our
propensity
for
math
problems
and
hard
work
.
Racial
equality
,
however
,
is
an
objective
good
,
not
a
dividend
paid
out
to
those
who
meet
the
societal
standards
for
what
constitutes
an
upstanding
minority
.
The
Model
Minority
paradigm
creates
a
wedge
between
Asians
and
other
minorities
while
fueling
an
anti
Black
,
capitalist
meritocracy
that
justifies
the
status
quo
for
people
of
color
.
In
this
column
,
I
argue
that
our
transformation
to
the
acceptable
had
very
little
to
do
with
our
culture
and
investments
in
education
.
Independently
of
whether
or
not
we
were
able
to
pull
ourselves
up
by
our
bootstraps
,
Asians
still
need
to
be
more
vocal
about
racism
and
politics
.
I
understand
that
many
of
the
arguments
I
am
making
are
quite
broad
;
I
seek
to
reduce
the
number
of
incorrect
generalizations
about
the
Asian
community
especially
because
most
of
my
musings
begin
from
the
standpoint
of
East
Asians
in
the
United
States
.
I
will
not
extrapolate
my
thoughts
to
other
Asian
populations
because
there
are
significant
differences
that
hinder
the
accuracy
of
my
analysis
.
The
pattern
of
Asian
upward
mobility
is
real
,
but
the
mainstream
causal
analysis
is
incorrect
.
Research
investigating
the
widespread
assumption
about
Asian
parents’
extraordinary
investments
in
education
found
that
educational
gains
alone
could
not
account
for
Asians
closing
the
wealth
gap
with
Whites
.
Asians
received
better
opportunities
as
a
result
of
a
drastic
shift
in
public
sentiment
in
the
20th
century
fueled
by
geopolitical
conflict
and
the
civil
rights
movement
.
Providing
equal
rights
to
Asians
helped
the
United
States’
international
standing
and
struggle
against
communist
regimes
,
particularly
in
Asia
,
by
forwarding
the
argument
that
the
U
.
S
.
was
a
liberal
democracy
where
people
of
color
could
enjoy
identical
protections
and
opportunities
.
Similarly
,
Asian
stories
were
used
as
propaganda
to
curtail
concessions
in
the
civil
rights
movement
by
embracing
the
hard
working
nature
of
Asians
and
insinuating
that
Blacks
were
to
be
blamed
for
their
own
poverty
.
The
stereotypes
of
Asian
obedience
and
docile
ness
allowed
the
U
.
S
.
to
advance
the
understanding
that
patience
would
be
rewarded
and
that
political
retaliation
would
be
met
with
militant
resistance
.
Regardless
of
whether
you
find
this
historical
analysis
convincing
,
I
think
that
it
is
both
ethical
and
possible
to
do
comparative
analysis
between
the
Black
experience
and
the
Asian
experience
in
the
United
States
.
Many
,
including
soft
left
liberals
,
argue
that
comparing
the
material
conditions
and
positionality
of
minorities
devolves
into
a
race
to
the
bottom
that
encourages
an
Oppression
Olympics
and
that
this
is
a
bad
thing
because
it
denies
the
legitimacy
of
victimization
of
other
groups
.
This
threat
based
on
the
idea
that
we
are
all
equally
people
of
color
is
an
intellectual
charge
that
relies
upon
the
same
colorblind
logic
as
the
stop
playing
the
race
card
.
.
Not
only
does
this
view
presume
a
monolithic
understanding
of
racial
victimhood
,
but
also
dangerously
and
incorrectly
allows
Asians
and
other
immigrants
groups
to
conflate
their
experiences
with
those
of
Black
people
in
the
United
States
.
Progress
is
only
possible
when
the
oppressor
wills
it
,
but
civil
society
has
consistently
demonstrated
that
it
has
a
psychotic
compulsion
to
commit
anti
Black
violence
.
Chattel
slavery
has
replicated
itself
with
different
names
;
the
accumulation
of
history
from
the
Atlantic
Slave
Trade
to
the
Prison
Industrial
Complex
and
the
murder
of
Trayvon
Martin
are
proof
.
The
truth
is
that
Asians
and
everyone
else
including
the
smart
,
woke
ones
at
Duke
need
a
history
lesson
on
the
true
scale
and
nature
of
black
suffering
.
Having
an
understanding
of
the
racial
triangulation
between
White
,
Black
and
Yellow
is
essential
to
understanding
how
inequality
is
established
,
sustained
,
and
perfected
.
I
am
not
a
self
hating
Asian
American
,
and
it
should
be
obvious
that
my
argument
isn’t
that
we
as
a
group
have
not
experienced
structural
antagonisms
.
Precisely
,
to
remember
who
we
are
as
Asians
is
to
remember
internment
and
Fu
Manchu
.
To
remember
is
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
not
our
country
regardless
of
whether
it
may
fetishize
our
women
and
commodify
our
cuisine
.
To
remember
is
to
understand
that
White
civil
society
believes
we
are
personality
less
,
desexualized
and
ultimately
forgettable
.
The
lived
experiences
of
our
own
peers
and
ancestors
should
,
if
anything
,
give
us
greater
reason
to
inquire
more
deeply
about
race
in
the
United
States
and
to
stand
in
solidarity
with
the
oppressed
.

Welcome
to
Duke
,
both
new
and
returning
students
.
nbsp
;
Before
you
arrived
,
you
watched
a
video
training
about
sexual
assault
;
you
will
get
talks
about
alcohol
and
drugs
,
too
.
nbsp
;
You
may
have
taken
it
seriously
,
or
you
may
have
texted
with
friends
,
scrolled
through
your
Insta
account
or
watched
some
Netflix
at
the
same
time
.
nbsp
;
You
may
have
experienced
some
of
the
things
they
described
before
coming
to
Duke
.
Or
,
you
may
not
think
it
will
happen
to
you
.
I
am
a
psychiatrist
in
Durham
,
and
have
worked
in
proximity
to
Duke
for
over
30
years
.
nbsp
;
During
that
time
,
I
have
treated
numerous
Duke
students
who
were
sexually
assaulted
,
many
by
other
Duke
students
.
nbsp
;
The
harmful
impact
of
those
assaults
is
often
both
life
altering
and
life
long
.
nbsp
;
Some
had
to
leave
Duke
,
unable
to
continue
because
of
depression
or
panic
attacks
after
the
incident
,
others
were
hospitalized
for
suicidal
thoughts
.
Some
never
told
anyone
,
at
the
risk
of
losing
their
entire
friend
group
,
because
their
attacker
was
an
integral
part
of
it
.
nbsp
;
As
unique
as
each
person
is
,
so
are
the
stories
of
their
assaults
and
resultant
suffering
.
nbsp
;
A
survey
published
in
the
Chronicle
last
year
showed
that
48
.
5
percent
of
female
students
and
13
.
5
percent
of
male
students
reported
a
sexual
assault
during
their
time
at
Duke
.
nbsp
;
These
are
staggering
numbers
,
and
data
shows
that
sexual
assault
is
typically
underreported
.
nbsp
;
nbsp
;
All
of
you
are
smart
,
or
you
wouldn’t
be
here
.
nbsp
;
Here
is
some
science
to
ponder
.
Duke
professor
Dan
Ariely
did
a
profoundly
intriguing
,
disturbing
study
about
the
effect
of
sexual
arousal
on
judgment
and
sexual
decision
making
in
college
age
men
.
nbsp
;
The
results
are
stunning
.
nbsp
;
For
example
,
sexual
arousal
increased
willingness
to
engage
in
morally
questionable
sexual
behavior
such
as
drugging
women
to
have
sex
and
continuing
to
try
to
have
sex
even
after
a
date
says
,
no
.
nbsp
;
Alcohol
and
sexual
arousal
also
impacts
the
decision
making
capacity
of
women
.
When
they
want
to
make
friends
,
are
in
a
new
place
,
are
feeling
insecure
.
There
is
the
choice
to
leave
a
party
with
someone
,
thinking
that
you’ll
just
kind
of
fool
around
but
not
have
sex
,
that
when
you’ll
say
no
,
they
will
listen
.
The
other
critical
neurologic
inflection
point
is
when
the
midbrain
enters
nbsp
;
freeze
mode
rather
than
fight
or
flight
mode
you
learned
about
in
biology
.
nbsp
;
Like
possums
playing
dead
when
threatened
,
like
the
gazelle
caught
by
the
lion
,
our
brains
can
also
release
a
flood
of
neurotransmitters
in
a
dangerous
situation
,
so
that
we
don’t
feel
ourselves
being
harmed
,
raped
or
eaten
alive
,
as
in
the
case
of
said
gazelle
.
nbsp
;
It’s
an
adaptive
mechanism
,
at
times
.
nbsp
;
I
have
worked
with
so
many
students
who
described
being
unable
to
escape
,
either
because
their
assaulter
was
stronger
,
because
they
felt
ashamed
or
felt
that
they
had
invited
this
,
or
most
frequently
,
because
they
had
entered
this
dissociative
state
.
I
couldn’t
cry
out
,
I
just
lay
there
waiting
for
it
to
be
over
,
I
had
said
no
and
he
didn’t
listen
and
I
couldn’t
move
,
are
themes
I
hear
repeatedly
.
They
then
hold
the
trauma
in
their
bodies
,
experiencing
a
lifetime
of
anxiety
,
depression
,
hypervigilance
or
other
symptoms
of
PTSD
.
nbsp
;
These
students
spend
time
and
money
on
treatment
,
if
they
are
fortunate
to
have
access
and
resources
and
make
the
choice
to
do
so
.
nbsp
;
The
perpetrators
are
often
unaware
that
they
have
caused
this
,
as
confrontation
or
disclosure
is
risky
for
many
reasons
.
If
I
can
prevent
even
one
assault
by
writing
this
,
it
will
be
worth
it
.
Look
out
for
your
friends
.
nbsp
;
Don’t
trust
anyone
you
don’t
know
.
We
make
the
assumption
that
if
they
are
a
Duke
student
,
they
are
trustworthy
.
nbsp
;
I
have
seen
several
women
who
were
raped
by
the
guy
who
offered
to
walk
them
home
from
a
party
so
they
would
be
safe
.
nbsp
;
It’s
wrong
,
but
it
happens
.
If
you
see
a
friend
who
has
had
too
much
to
drink
leaving
a
party
or
Shooters
,
with
someone
else
who
is
also
drunk
,
intervene
.
nbsp
;
Don’t
worry
about
hurting
feelings
;
drama
is
better
than
a
lifetime
of
trauma
.
If
you
see
someone
taking
an
intoxicated
woman
to
a
room
at
a
party
,
speak
up
.
nbsp
;
All
of
this
happens
all
too
frequently
,
at
Duke
,
as
elsewhere
on
college
campuses
.
Let’s
make
Duke
a
safer
place
for
all
.
There
is
a
lot
of
excitement
surrounding
the
Duke
football
team
right
now
.
I
applaud
the
measures
that
Duke
is
taking
to
explore
blatant
and
hidden
racism
,
bring
light
onto
these
issues
and
strongly
move
away
from
its
segregated
past
.
One
notable
and
highly
visible
element
remains
The
Duke
Blue
Devil
is
white
.
Or
,
a
pinkish
version
of
white
.
If
we
were
true
to
the
original
idea
,
it
I
assume
devils
have
no
gender
,
whether
they
wear
Prada
or
not
should
be
blue
.
If
aligned
with
today's
multi
racial
and
non
discriminatory
views
,
I
imagine
the
global
mixture
of
all
existing
skin
colors
would
be
a
darker
hue
than
the
current
pinkish
Blue
Devil
.
.
.
it
certainly
should
reflect
that
the
global
population
has
a
range
of
ethnicities
and
regional
groups
,
including
Han
Chinese
Asian
,
European
Caucasian
,
African
,
Middle
Eastern
,
Native
Peoples
Americas
and
Oceania
and
others
that
I
have
surely
forgotten
.
A
true
rainbow
.
Were
we
to
try
to
mix
other
human
ethnic
qualities
into
the
Blue
Devil
,
the
pointy
ears
must
surely
go
!
I
have
no
idea
what
color
would
remain
,
but
not
pinky
white
.
I'm
not
advocating
we
get
rid
of
the
trident
,
tail
or
ears
,
but
surely
we
have
outgrown
that
pinkish
complexion
.
Besides
,
what
kind
of
hellfire
burn
protection
would
be
needed
?
Thoughts
only
.
You
rightly
point
out
the
tragedy
of
Indigenous
people
particularly
those
in
Oceania
suffering
the
brunt
of
our
climate
catastrophe
.
It
is
important
for
the
Global
North
to
recognize
the
costs
of
climate
change
are
,
to
put
it
mildly
,
unevenly
distributed
.
Even
more
important
is
that
the
world
grapple
honestly
and
intensely
with
these
ethical
issues
.
But
I
have
a
bone
to
pick
with
the
all
or
nothing
mentality
toward
environmentalism
,
not
least
because
of
the
tacit
implication
that
underpins
all
calls
for
revolution
that
incremental
progress
is
so
impotent
as
to
be
meaningless
,
and
that
we
have
little
to
preserve
of
what
came
before
.
Chalking
our
future
up
to
either
devolv
ing
into
fascism
or
embracing
eco
socialism
presents
a
false
choice
.
A
more
nuanced
view
for
addressing
climate
change
is
in
order
.
Fossil
fuels
are
directly
responsible
for
improved
quality
of
life
for
billions
of
people
.
That
is
why
the
developing
world
aggressively
pursues
them
.
Energy
use
is
highly
correlated
with
access
to
education
,
healthcare
,
advancement
of
women
in
society
,
and
many
other
positive
HDI
indicators
.
Reliance
on
fossil
fuels
to
achieve
that
is
not
a
capitalist
conspiracy
;
it’s
because
fossil
fuels
are
affordable
for
people
living
on
two
dollars
a
day
and
,
more
importantly
,
are
reliable
under
strenuous
conditions
.
As
unacceptable
as
the
energy
cut
off
in
Brooklyn
was
,
outages
would
be
far
more
common
and
widespread
if
we
relied
solely
on
renewables
.
Advancements
in
technology
,
fueled
by
capitalization
,
are
needed
to
address
these
inconvenient
problems
of
affordability
and
intermittency
.
Further
,
it
is
disingenuous
to
decry
what’s
happening
in
Brazil
as
a
consequence
of
Capitalism
without
acknowledging
that
Costa
Rica
has
successfully
used
free
market
principles
to
replenish
its
rainforests
and
revitalize
its
economy
.
Latin
America
is
a
prime
example
of
unbridled
exploitation
of
indigenous
people
.
Yet
the
socioeconomic
and
environmental
conditions
of
its
countries
are
a
pastiche
not
a
unilateral
reality
.
Peering
into
the
abyss
of
climate
change
is
humbling
and
overwhelming
.
It’s
the
kind
of
exercise
that
makes
you
want
to
arm
yourself
with
as
many
tools
as
possible
.
Hacking
away
and
setting
fire
to
the
free
market
as
if
it
were
Amazonia
is
not
the
right
answer
.
I
didn’t
try
West
Union
until
my
sophomore
year
.
I
respectfully
ate
all
of
my
Marketplace
swipes
for
breakfast
and
dinner
.
nbsp
;
For
lunch
,
I
salvaged
peanut
butter
and
jelly
from
Marketplace
in
the
mornings
and
put
it
together
in
my
Basset
triple
in
the
afternoons
.
I
was
happy
.
I
enjoy
food
,
and
even
though
I
turned
away
when
the
Marketplace
workers
poured
Egg
mix
onto
their
omelette
pans
,
I
never
complained
.
Sophomore
year
,
I
ate
West
Union
with
joy
.
We
didn’t
even
have
Sazón
.
JB’s
,
Tandoor
,
Sprout
,
ABP
,
Gyotaku
,
and
especially
the
place
upstairs
lorded
over
Marketplace
in
quality
and
presentation
of
food
.
After
a
year
of
dry
chicken
,
hummus
,
and
peanut
butter
and
jelly
,
I
felt
like
a
king
,
and
the
well
balanced
meals
I
was
then
eating
made
me
consider
my
body
to
be
a
respectable
throne
room
.
Understandably
,
never
have
I
felt
more
disrespected
than
when
Sami
Kirkpatrick
came
to
my
palace
and
spat
his
article
about
JB’s
Salmon
onto
the
ground
.
Years
of
construction
went
into
West
Union
and
with
it
years
of
thought
in
carefully
selecting
the
restaurants
,
menus
and
food
that
students
would
be
eating
for
years
to
come
.
Feeding
thousands
of
people
every
day
with
differences
of
background
,
dietary
restrictions
,
and
eating
preferences
is
a
careful
dance
.
They
have
to
meet
those
needs
as
well
as
provide
options
that
satisfy
the
nutritional
requirements
of
college
students
that
would
often
prefer
to
eat
ramen
or
mac
and
cheese
in
their
rooms
than
go
out
and
spend
money
on
an
egg
sandwich
.
Incidentally
,
one
of
those
nutritional
requirements
is
fish
.
Fish
provides
essential
Omega
3's
and
other
vitamins
that
help
power
our
brains
as
well
as
keep
us
healthy
.
Unfortunately
,
fish
is
also
extremely
hard
to
handle
.
Fish
spoils
quickly
and
transporting
the
quality
of
fish
that
JB’s
puts
out
is
an
even
harder
challenge
.
Shipments
of
fish
are
often
made
on
Mondays
,
and
I
imagine
Sami
,
who
despite
claiming
to
be
a
restaurant
connoisseur
,
foolishly
ordered
fish
on
a
Friday
when
it
is
more
likely
to
have
spoiled
.
Still
,
I
am
skeptical
that
Duke
,
the
JB’s
staff
,
and
Jay
Singletary
who
was
nominated
as
a
Chron15
Icon
would
be
anything
less
than
Gordon
Ramsay
levels
of
careful
with
their
food
.
Noting
that
Sami’s
report
of
food
poisoning
is
extremely
rare
,
I
feel
it
may
be
nothing
less
than
a
coincidence
poorly
timed
with
perhaps
a
large
order
of
Heavenly
Buffalo’s
to
fill
Sami’s
appetite
for
destroying
the
reputation
of
campus
dining
.
Providing
food
for
thousands
of
customers
without
a
single
complaint
until
this
article
is
an
exceptional
challenge
that
Duke
has
handled
phenomenally
.
On
other
college
campuses
,
I’ve
seen
reports
of
grasshoppers
in
the
salad
,
bugs
in
meat
,
and
worse
.
Duke
has
displayed
an
amazing
dining
program
that
is
overflowing
with
amazing
options
,
like
Chef’s
Kitchen
and
Sazón
and
the
perpetually
changing
second
floor
restaurant
.
I
can
only
imagine
that
Sami
wrote
that
article
because
the
lack
of
Omega
3
in
his
diet
has
worn
away
at
his
judgment
.
This
weekend
was
perfect
for
me
and
was
helpful
to
not
only
my
decision
to
commit
,
but
my
mental
health
.
I
feel
like
here
I
can
actually
and
now
already
do
have
a
community
of
gay
people
which
I've
never
had
before
,
and
without
this
weekend
,
I
don't
think
that
would've
been
possible
.
This
quote
from
a
participant
of
Duke’s
2019
Pride
Invitational
program
reflects
a
sentiment
that
many
of
us
may
have
felt
as
high
school
seniors
excitement
to
set
foot
on
campus
but
apprehension
about
what
joining
the
Duke
family
actually
entails
.
As
the
turbulent
period
of
high
school
exams
and
yearbook
signing
comes
to
a
close
,
we
end
a
chapter
of
our
lives
and
begin
writing
a
nbsp
;
new
story
,
full
of
exploration
and
newfound
challenges
.
And
this
process
is
especially
unique
for
those
beginning
to
tackle
questions
about
their
sexuality
and
gender
identity
.
As
minority
students
ourselves
,
we
were
in
the
midst
of
embracing
the
singularities
of
our
own
stories
when
we
began
planning
Duke’s
first
Pride
Invitational
.
As
we
learned
to
overcome
certain
obstacles
and
form
pockets
of
community
where
we
felt
safe
,
we
realized
that
our
collective
experiences
could
be
leveraged
to
make
this
transition
into
college
a
bit
easier
for
those
who
came
after
us
.
This
wasn’t
a
novel
idea
programs
like
Latino
Student
Recruitment
Weekend
LSRW
and
the
Black
Student
Alliance
Invitational
BSAI
have
long
been
connecting
Latinx
and
Black
students
with
specially
catered
resources
and
programming
.
We
interacted
with
these
programs
ourselves
and
saw
how
participants
arrived
on
campus
with
a
cohort
that
they
could
lean
on
and
already
aware
of
what
Duke
provided
.
We
recognized
that
a
similar
program
for
incoming
LGBTQIA
students
could
be
crucial
to
their
sense
of
safety
and
community
at
a
time
when
many
of
them
are
only
just
beginning
to
explore
their
identities
.
Such
a
program
had
long
been
just
an
unlikely
possibility
among
Duke’s
queer
circles
,
but
in
fall
,
2017
we
decided
to
forge
this
idea
into
a
reality
.
Just
bright
eyed
sophomore
Duke
Student
Government
senators
at
the
time
,
we
could
never
have
imagined
the
rollercoaster
ride
that
planning
an
invitational
program
from
scratch
would
entail
.
How
could
we
convince
Duke
that
,
in
order
to
make
its
goals
of
diversity
and
student
safety
a
tangible
practice
,
this
invitational
was
a
necessity
?
How
could
we
convince
high
school
seniors
to
expose
themselves
to
an
LGBTQIA
college
program
at
a
time
when
being
openly
queer
continues
to
carry
the
risk
of
violence
and
shame
?
These
questions
planted
themselves
at
the
front
of
our
minds
as
we
began
piecing
the
program
together
.
We
spent
two
years
committed
to
planning
meeting
with
students
and
faculty
,
exchanging
countless
emails
,
reaching
out
to
Durham
groups
,
pursuing
funding
,
and
coordinating
volunteers
.
Finally
,
in
April
2019
,
Duke
welcomed
its
inaugural
Pride
Invitational
group
.
These
students
had
all
followed
very
different
paths
to
reach
this
point
,
but
arrived
with
a
shared
eagerness
to
explore
Duke
and
Durham
and
an
open
mindedness
towards
what
the
community
might
offer
them
.
They
participated
in
a
welcoming
event
at
the
CSGD
,
an
Honesty
Hour
at
the
Mary
Lou
Williams
Center
,
a
dinner
at
the
LGBTQ
Center
of
Durham
,
a
drag
show
featuring
local
performers
Naomi
Dix
and
Stormie
Daie
,
an
alumnx
and
faculty
brunch
,
and
finally
,
closing
remarks
from
President
Vincent
Price
.
We
watched
with
delight
as
participants
stood
in
a
circle
before
heading
out
,
laughing
as
they
passed
their
phones
around
to
exchange
numbers
and
follow
each
other
on
social
media
.
This
was
the
small
community
we
had
set
out
to
create
the
first
sparks
of
a
flame
that
will
hopefully
be
stoked
with
each
iteration
of
the
program
.
Creating
this
program
taught
us
how
to
tackle
the
web
of
Duke’s
bureaucracies
head
on
.
We
learned
to
compromise
when
necessary
and
defend
our
ideas
when
they
were
met
with
resistance
.
We
discovered
which
administrators
were
our
allies
and
which
offices
would
elevate
our
work
.
We
were
grateful
to
have
the
support
of
the
Office
of
Admissions
and
Center
for
Sexual
and
Gender
Diversity
,
but
we
knew
early
on
that
we
would
be
doing
a
lot
of
labor
on
Duke’s
behalf
.
Duke
is
making
its
mark
among
its
peers
in
promoting
inclusion
and
safety
for
its
LGBTQ
students
.
Of
course
,
despite
the
program’s
rainbow
aesthetic
,
we
know
that
participants
will
eventually
arrive
on
campus
and
confront
a
reality
as
queer
students
that
will
not
always
be
rainbows
and
sunshine
.
Historically
,
the
university
has
discriminated
against
its
queer
community
and
these
effects
still
live
on
today
.
The
invitational
is
born
from
this
history
and
the
need
to
combat
its
legacy
.
We
hope
this
article
might
act
as
a
call
to
others
to
join
us
in
tackling
these
concerns
and
building
a
better
program
in
the
following
years
.
We
hope
it
serves
as
an
institutional
record
for
future
student
organizers
and
an
anecdote
of
perseverance
and
patience
in
advocating
for
our
communities
,
often
in
spite
of
resistance
and
deflection
.
We
recognize
that
this
invitational
is
just
a
small
step
in
the
right
direction
for
Duke
.
But
we
are
confident
that
its
growth
will
allow
LGBTQIA
students
to
form
unbreakable
bonds
to
shield
one
another
from
societal
discrimination
.
In
acknowledging
what
Duke
lacks
and
revealing
what
it
has
to
offer
,
we
can
begin
setting
the
foundation
for
what
Duke
can
be
.

We
want
to
thank
the
CSGD
,
the
Office
of
Admissions
,
the
LGBTQ
Center
of
Durham
,
all
our
volunteers
,
and
,
of
course
,
our
participants
for
working
in
community
to
build
a
better
Duke
.
Many
Duke
cancer
experts
attended
last
month’s
roundtable
with
Vice
President
Joe
Biden
and
said
that
the
conversation
was
not
just
about
publicity
.
Our
campus
is
abuzz
with
political
discussions
that
will
only
become
more
important
nbsp
;
as
the
Democratic
primary
continues
and
the
general
presidential
election
of
2020
nears
.
President
Trump’s
defects
and
malign
activities
,
while
not
the
focus
of
this
piece
and
too
numerous
in
quantity
to
list
here
,
have
made
him
a
weak
incumbent
,
vulnerable
to
defeat
.
However
,
the
president’s
electoral
odds
are
being
strengthened
by
the
Democratic
party’s
hard
left
turn
and
embrace
of
candidates
such
as
Bernie
Sanders
and
Elizabeth
Warren
.
Confined
to
the
Duke
bubble
or
progressive
Twitter
,
one
could
not
be
faulted
for
perceiving
that
there
is
widespread
support
for
hard
left
policies
and
that
a
campaign
centered
on
these
policies
can
capture
strong
voting
majorities
.
But
there
is
little
evidence
to
support
either
of
those
conclusions
.
In
fact
,
political
science
findings
continue
to
suggest
that
candidates
with
more
ideologically
extreme
positions
are
punished
by
general
election
voters
.
To
make
matters
worse
,
many
of
the
more
extreme
Democratic
candidates
,
in
an
effort
to
attract
progressive
supporters
,
have
exposed
themselves
to
future
general
election
attacks
for
taking
controversial
stances
on
issues
such
as
eliminating
private
health
insurance
,
providing
medicare
coverage
to
illegal
immigrants
,
and
compulsory
gun
buybacks
.
Enter
Joe
Biden
.
He
is
certainly
not
perfect
or
without
his
faults
,
but
a
strong
case
for
supporting
Joe
Biden
can
be
found
in
1
his
electoral
advantages
vis
à
vis
the
President
and
2
his
potential
to
restore
the
country
to
a
state
of
cooperation
and
effective
governance
.
Of
all
the
candidates
in
the
Democratic
field
,
Biden
has
the
clearest
path
to
an
Electoral
College
victory
.
It
is
no
secret
that
Trump’s
path
to
victory
hinged
on
small
margin
victories
in
key
rustbelt
states
,
namely
,
Pennsylvania
,
Michigan
,
and
Wisconsin
.
In
fact
,
outside
of
flipping
both
Florida
and
Arizona
both
of
which
Trump
carried
by
larger
margins
,
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
Democratic
path
to
electoral
victory
that
does
not
involve
those
three
states
.
It
is
also
no
secret
that
Biden’s
childhood
roots
in
Scranton
,
PA
,
role
in
the
2009
auto
bailout
,
and
history
of
political
moderation
afford
him
significant
advantages
in
these
swing
states
.
In
a
September
4
poll
,
Biden
held
a
nine
point
lead
on
Trump
in
Wisconsin
,
while
Warren
was
even
with
Trump
.
Moreover
,
in
a
July
25
poll
,
Biden
held
an
eight
point
general
election
lead
over
Trump
in
Ohio
a
state
which
Trump
carried
by
eight
points
in
2016
while
Sanders
and
Warren
both
trailed
Trump
by
one
point
.
While
polls
can
certainly
change
,
it
is
likely
that
a
Biden
nomination
would
not
only
put
the
rustbelt
on
the
table
but
would
also
deliver
it
,
and
by
extension
the
White
House
,
by
a
comfortable
margin
.
However
,
stemming
largely
from
the
primary
success
of
Sanders
and
Trump’s
ultimate
general
election
victory
in
2016
,
there
is
a
notion
that
the
Democratic
nominee
needs
to
energize
the
Democratic
base
by
racing
to
the
left
.
Sanders
and
Warren
both
embody
this
high
energy
strategy
,
campaigning
on
political
revolution
and
big
,
structural
change
respectively
.
By
contrast
,
the
2018
midterms
suggest
that
the
path
to
Democratic
victory
in
purple
states
i
.
e
.
states
that
the
Democratic
nominee
will
need
to
win
in
2020
is
to
campaign
moderately
and
smartly
on
issues
that
have
broad
appeal
while
letting
Trump’s
unpopularity
and
the
fatigued
Republican
base
take
care
of
the
rest
.
A
hard
left
swing
will
not
only
dissuade
moderate
voters
who
are
otherwise
fed
up
with
Trump
,
but
will
also
rally
the
Republican
base
around
fears
of
socialism
and
draconian
wealth
redistribution
.
Outside
of
democratic
socialism
somehow
catching
fire
in
the
politically
moderate
heartland
,
it
is
hard
to
foresee
how
the
Sanders
Warren
strategy
will
result
in
an
Electoral
College
victory
.
Indeed
,
this
path
is
more
likely
to
inflate
Democratic
margins
in
places
like
California
and
New
York
at
the
expense
of
crucial
Midwestern
swing
states
.
All
of
these
electoral
advantages
aside
,
a
Democratic
strategist
would
be
remiss
to
ignore
the
serious
problem
both
Sanders
and
Warren
have
in
attracting
African
American
voters
a
critical
component
of
a
winning
coalition
in
2020
.
Thus
,
if
the
goal
is
to
actually
win
the
White
House
,
the
more
moderate
Biden
is
the
best
candidate
to
run
in
the
general
election
.
Still
,
some
might
retort
that
electability
shouldn’t
be
the
only
consideration
when
picking
a
nominee
;
instead
,
a
candidate’s
ideas
and
capacity
to
enact
change
should
take
precedence
.
However
,
it
is
in
this
area
that
Biden
especially
separates
himself
from
the
pack
and
wins
on
the
merits
.
It
is
highly
probable
that
the
winner
of
this
coming
presidential
election
will
face
at
least
one
Republican
controlled
chamber
during
their
term
.
Given
this
reality
,
it
is
wildly
unrealistic
to
expect
that
a
candidate
will
be
able
to
implement
sweeping
policy
changes
without
significant
compromise
and
bipartisan
agreements
.

Importantly
,
Biden
is
the
only
top
tier
candidate
who
has
a
chance
of
softening
our
partisan
animosity
and
returning
the
country
to
a
state
of
normalcy
.
His
likability
is
contagious
and
cuts
across
socioeconomic
and
even
party
lines
.
In
addition
,
be
it
the
Brady
background
check
bill
for
gun
control
in
1994
or
his
sponsorship
of
the
first
climate
change
bill
back
in
1986
,
Biden
has
a
proven
capacity
for
bipartisan
leadership
.
In
line
with
this
track
record
,
his
current
proposals
for
America
recognize
the
serious
challenges
before
us
climate
change
,
healthcare
,
and
an
evolving
economy
but
seek
to
rectify
them
through
measured
and
practical
solutions
that
actually
have
a
chance
of
adoption
.
In
contrast
,
Sanders
and
Warren
are
polarizing
figures
who
,
if
elected
,
would
represent
a
swing
in
our
national
politics
from
the
far
right
to
the
far
left
.
Political
gridlock
would
continue
and
our
descent
into
ever
greater
polarization
and
anger
would
persist
.
There
would
be
nothing
restorative
or
healing
about
a
Sanders
or
Warren
presidency
as
each
would
seek
radical
agendas
that
demand
little
in
the
way
of
compromise
or
pluralism
.
Finally
,
it
is
worth
examining
and
deconstructing
some
common
criticisms
of
Joe
Biden
.
It
is
true
that
Biden’s
debate
performances
have
been
shaky
thus
far
.
Yet
it's
not
as
if
Biden
would
be
facing
an
eloquent
or
rational
debater
in
Donald
Trump
come
2020
,
nor
is
there
compelling
evidence
that
recent
presidential
debates
have
strongly
influenced
voters
as
only
the
most
engaged
voters
watch
.
Furthermore
,
despite
his
gaffes
and
occasionally
rambling
responses
,
it
appears
that
voters
don’t
particularly
care
given
how
Biden
has
retained
his
polling
lead
.
Lastly
,
other
candidates
have
insinuated
that
the
76
year
old
Biden
is
too
old
and
out
of
touch
for
young
voters
.
Yet
his
challengers
i
.
e
.
Warren
,
Sanders
,
and
Trump
are
all
septuagenarians
themselves
at
70
,
78
,
and
73
respectively
.
It
is
clear
that
none
of
Biden’s
opponents
can
play
a
youth
card
and
that
the
media’s
incessantly
negative
coverage
of
Biden
is
telling
and
perhaps
indicative
of
its
bias
.
In
conclusion
,
far
left
activists
and
insurgent
progressives
within
the
Democratic
party
are
increasing
Donald
Trump’s
odds
of
reelection
.
They
are
simultaneously
undermining
the
most
electable
candidate
available
and
handing
President
Trump
gift
after
gift
as
they
adopt
controversial
hard
left
stances
.
So
,
as
political
discussions
continue
on
campus
,
it
is
worth
remembering
that
Joe
Biden
,
despite
his
imperfections
,
is
uniquely
positioned
to
defeat
President
Trump
in
2020
and
has
the
best
chance
of
implementing
an
actual
agenda
.

Smiths
are
to
pallor
complexions
as
hot
air
balloons
are
to
the
state
of
New
Mexico
.
And
yes
,
New
Mexico
is
a
state
.
Contrary
to
the
belief
of
some
,
there
is
an
expanse
of
land
between
Texas
and
Arizona
.
There
is
not
a
great
void
of
oblivion
for
where
the
Rio
Grande
river
dumps
into
the
depths
of
purgatory
.
Instead
,
this
great
void
is
found
in
the
academic
disparity
which
has
left
some
students
unaware
of
perhaps
the
most
vibrant
cultural
center
in
the
nation
.
Additionally
,
over
sixty
percent
of
New
Mexicans
belong
to
at
least
one
ethnic
minority
group
.
I’d
like
to
introduce
myself
now
.
My
name
is
Quinn
Smith
,
I
am
a
member
of
the
Chickasaw
tribe
of
Oklahoma
,
born
and
raised
in
Albuquerque
,
New
Mexico
.
I
am
not
defined
by
the
words
of
others
.
My
words
define
me
,
I
create
my
own
identity
.
I
leapt
for
joy
when
I
found
out
that
Duke
University
was
going
to
introduce
me
to
NASA
.
I
mean
,
I
wasn’t
even
a
freshman
and
I
was
going
to
meet
representatives
from
one
of
the
world
leaders
in
space
exploration
.
I
showed
my
mother
the
invitation
too
,
and
she
was
taken
aback
.
Upon
further
exploration
into
the
invitation
I
discovered
that
NASA
was
an
acronym
for
something
else
at
Duke
.
It
stood
for
Native
American
Student
Alliance
.
And
while
the
disbelief
faded
after
this
revelation
,
the
amazement
persisted
long
after
.
Why
does
a
school
in
North
Carolina
care
so
deeply
about
Native
students
?
Especially
native
students
of
the
pallor
smith
variety
?
Through
my
short
visit
during
Blue
Devil
Days
,
I
was
taught
that
my
presence
at
an
institution
of
higher
education
in
the
United
States
of
America
went
against
everything
.
Professor
Myron
Dewey
and
Cherokee
Supreme
Court
Justice
Brenda
Pipestem
a
Duke
alum
joined
NASA
in
sharing
.
Native
American
culture
should
be
protected
,
preserved
,
and
celebrated
on
a
college
campus
were
answers
to
my
ancestor’s
prayers
.
Their
impassioned
speeches
moved
me
greatly
.
Admissions
Dean
Stephen
McLaughlin
sat
out
,
in
front
of
every
incoming
NASA
member
,
a
copy
of
the
book
There
,
There
by
Tommy
Orange
.
I
was
instructed
that
even
if
I
did
not
enjoy
reading
,
I
would
love
the
novel
.
I
do
love
reading
,
and
this
novel
furthered
my
love
of
the
written
English
language
.
Little
did
I
know
what
impact
this
book
from
Duke
would
play
in
the
upcoming
months
.
Dene
Oxendene
is
attempting
to
create
a
documentary
attempting
to
give
a
voice
to
those
who
seldom
have
the
chance
to
hear
their
perspectives
affirmed
.
He
let
the
content
direct
his
artistic
pursuits
.
This
moved
me
so
greatly
.
See
,
for
months
I
had
been
brainstorming
ways
to
use
my
new
Christmas
video
camera
to
showcase
a
perspective
of
which
much
of
the
United
States
is
unaware
Albuquerque
and
New
Mexico
.
One
day
I
sat
out
with
my
friends
to
interview
people
in
downtown
Albuquerque
.
In
the
next
few
weeks
I
created
a
YouTube
channel
by
the
name
of
Watermelon
Ridge
named
after
the
Sandia
mountains
which
overlook
Albuquerque
and
a
small
internet
documentary
series
by
the
name
of
Enchantment
505
New
Mexico
is
the
Land
of
Enchantment
and
505
is
the
area
code
of
much
of
the
state
.
I
had
no
plan
in
mind
,
I
let
my
content
direct
my
artistic
merits
.
This
plan
paid
off
.
I
met
a
Native
American
man
who
lived
all
over
the
nation
,
who
carves
canes
made
from
wood
.
I
met
a
man
who
registered
teenagers
to
vote
and
a
woman
who
worked
at
one
of
the
most
unique
gas
stations
,
Russell’s
Travel
Center
in
Springer
,
New
Mexico
.
Through
the
words
of
Tommy
Orange
,
and
because
of
nbsp
;
the
overwhelming
support
from
Duke
University
who
gave
me
those
words
,
I
was
able
to
share
a
perspective
seldom
showcased
.
I
was
not
given
the
gift
of
storytelling
.
Perhaps
I
do
not
possess
it
.
I
was
merely
given
the
inspiration
and
motivation
to
follow
one
of
my
deepest
passions
.
It
has
changed
my
life
;
one
story
can
inspire
many
.
In
its
95th
academic
year
,
the
gothic
campus
has
been
revived
with
the
common
sights
of
students
braving
the
lines
during
the
claustrophobic
West
Union
lunch
hours
and
falling
back
into
their
caffeine
sustained
work
routines
.
New
among
these
usual
sightings
are
the
electric
scooters
dotted
across
campus
following
approval
from
Duke
and
the
City
of
Durham
over
the
summer
.
Scooters
admittedly
hold
some
merit
especially
when
the
trip
is
short
.
The
baseline
price
and
cost
per
distance
traveled
on
a
scooter
are
much
cheaper
than
popular
ride
share
services
.
Scooters
,
when
parked
properly
,
decrease
the
volume
of
traffic
.
Getting
to
those
hard
to
reach
places
has
become
easier
for
people
on
campus
whose
needs
are
excluded
from
limited
bus
routes
.
Beyond
Duke
,
scooters
could
potentially
improve
mobility
in
low
income
areas
.
However
,
the
arrival
of
scooters
deserves
critical
scrutiny
,
as
they
are
the
University’s
latest
contribution
to
the
ongoing
conversation
about
access
.
Realistically
,
few
students
will
go
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
off
campus
on
the
glorified
toys
,
limiting
their
practical
value
.
Per
University
guidelines
,
scooters
will
not
operate
in
high
volume
areas
,
and
riders
must
adhere
to
a
series
of
safety
protocols
.
Yet
you’d
be
hard
pressed
to
see
anyone
wearing
a
helmet
or
even
obeying
traffic
laws
,
and
injuries
have
already
proved
themselves
common
.
There
are
also
physical
accessibility
concerns
as
their
use
is
limited
for
able
bodied
people
traveling
a
short
distance
with
a
very
light
load
.
From
an
economic
standpoint
,
although
the
cost
may
seem
relatively
insignificant
for
some
,
it
can
be
a
significant
accumulative
cost
for
others
,
resulting
in
a
stratification
of
use
.
The
use
of
scooters
,
especially
in
tandem
with
nearly
700
students
moving
from
Central
to
West
,
seems
symptomatic
of
how
West
Campus
may
have
been
pushed
beyond
its
carrying
capacity
.
This
has
brought
to
the
forefront
the
chronic
transportation
issues
at
Duke
.
It’s
the
second
week
of
classes
,
and
students
have
already
raised
concerns
about
how
buses
are
more
packed
,
sidewalks
are
more
cramped
and
Blue
Zone
spaces
are
frustratingly
scarce
.
Duke
has
an
obligation
to
provide
students
with
reliable
transportation
between
campuses
and
has
the
funds
.
This
historic
centralization
of
non
first
year
students
provided
the
perfect
opportunity
for
Duke
to
recommit
to
a
sustainable
,
accessible
vision
for
public
transportation
.
Instead
,
the
only
immediate
action
from
upper
administration
was
the
mere
addition
of
an
extra
East
West
route
.
Beyond
students
,
getting
around
Duke
and
Durham
has
become
a
nuisance
at
best
and
impossible
at
worst
for
many
students
,
staff
,
faculty
,
and
residents
.
Faculty
face
similar
hurdles
with
transportation
on
and
off
campus
.
The
latest
University
estimates
reveal
that
16
percent
of
Duke’s
total
emissions
are
the
result
of
employees
commuting
to
and
from
campus
.
Hidden
in
that
alarming
statistic
is
the
fact
that
80
percent
of
employees
drive
to
work
individually
and
that
,
compared
to
figures
from
2007
,
the
average
employee
lives
an
added
3
miles
away
from
campus
.
Once
on
campus
,
Duke
employees
struggle
to
find
parking
close
to
their
workplace
if
they
can
find
it
at
all
.
As
noted
,
this
is
not
Duke’s
first
public
transportation
related
faux
pas
.
Questions
about
the
future
of
the
Robertson
Express
exposed
Duke’s
convoluted
relationship
with
on
campus
public
transit
systems
.
Last
year’s
decision
to
not
be
involved
in
GoTriangle’s
light
rail
left
many
students
,
at
best
,
confused
and
,
at
worst
,
enraged
.
The
lack
of
funding
from
Duke
nearly
killed
the
Bull
City
Connector
the
fare
free
bus
that
connects
students
,
employees
,
and
University
and
Hospital
visitors
between
Duke
Hospital
and
Downtown
Durham
.
Instead
,
the
University
now
funds
a
private
shuttle
from
campus
to
its
downtown
properties
an
exclusive
service
only
available
to
those
with
a
valid
DukeCard
.
Duke’s
recent
history
indicates
a
move
away
from
publicly
accessible
bus
routes
and
toward
intimate
,
private
transportation
methods
.
What
the
University
needs
at
this
moment
is
greater
commitment
to
comprehensive
and
sustainable
public
transportation
,
not
a
yuppie
trend
.
So
far
,
there
are
plans
to
add
two
electric
buses
to
its
fleet
by
2020
and
reach
carbon
neutrality
by
2024
.
But
there
is
much
more
ground
to
cover
,
and
the
only
intuitive
solution
for
navigating
our
community
comes
via
an
expansion
of
Duke’s
public
transportation
services
.
On
campus
,
this
means
an
overhaul
of
the
bus
system
to
adapt
to
changing
campus
demands
.
It
means
expanding
parking
options
in
sustainable
ways
no
more
flat
lots
,
please
.
It
means
an
urgent
pivot
to
environmentally
sustainable
ways
to
navigate
campus
without
an
added
cost
to
users
.
In
the
community
,
it
looks
like
refunding
projects
like
the
Bull
City
Connector
or
collaboratively
reimagining
what
city
wide
transportation
could
look
like
.
When
the
opportunity
arises
,
the
University
must
rise
to
the
occasion
and
demonstrate
a
greater
commitment
to
sustainability
,
inclusivity
and
accessibility
,
which
can’t
be
achieved
with
electric
scooters
.
Last
week
the
U
.
S
.
Department
of
Education
released
a
letter
to
the
Duke
UNC
Consortium
for
Middle
East
Studies
,
informing
the
Consortium
of
their
potential
misuse
of
Title
VI
funding
.
Title
VI
funds
are
administered
by
the
Department
of
Education
to
support
foreign
language
and
area
or
international
studies
programs
.
A
collaboration
between
the
Duke
Middle
East
Studies
Center
and
the
UNC
Center
for
Middle
East
and
Islamic
Studies
,
the
Consortium
is
under
investigation
for
the
specific
subject
matter
their
programs
cover
.
In
particular
,
alleged
wrongdoings
include
too
few
graduates
working
in
government
positions
,
too
much
emphasis
placed
on
understanding
the
positive
aspects
of
Islam
,
and
too
little
serious
instruction
regarding
U
.
S
.
geopolitical
and
economic
needs
.
This
comes
directly
on
the
heels
of
recent
tweets
by
the
President
,
hinting
at
the
possibility
of
a
new
American
involved
conflict
in
the
Middle
East
.
For
most
current
undergraduates
,
and
even
many
graduate
students
,
American
invasion
and
imperialism
in
the
Middle
East
has
been
a
fact
of
life
.
As
imperialism
can
be
understood
as
the
process
by
which
a
nation
extracts
the
wealth
of
another
nation
or
people
for
their
own
enrichment
,
there
is
an
obvious
imperialist
logic
the
stance
the
letter
takes
.
It
declares
,
in
no
uncertain
terms
,
that
the
Middle
East
exists
only
as
a
vector
for
the
acquisition
of
political
power
and
economic
wealth
by
the
United
States
.
Any
knowledge
or
instruction
that
does
not
serve
to
further
these
interests
,
the
Department
of
Education
has
decided
,
is
ineligible
for
financial
support
.
After
all
,
a
program
that
does
not
provide
graduates
eager
to
work
on
state
projects
,
that
portrays
other
cultures
as
worthy
of
attention
and
inquiry
,
and
that
shies
away
from
geopolitics
is
useless
in
building
an
empire
.
Critical
to
imperial
logic
and
clearly
implied
in
the
letter
to
the
Consortium
is
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
an
American
identity
juxtaposed
against
a
threatening
,
oppositional
Other
.
American
interests
to
the
Department
of

not

.
American
means
white
,
and
sometimes
Black
,
but
always
Christian
,
and
always
wholly
committed
to
the
United
States
.
This
exclusionary
understanding
of
American
permeates
our
country
erasing
the
experiences
of
millions
and
enabling
the
immense
harm
and
murder
of
hundreds
.
The
Department
of
Education
actively
perpetuates
this
deadly
understanding
in
their
reprimand
of
the
Consortium
for
teacher
training
programs
that
explore
issues
of
multicultural
education
and
equity
and
create
more
welcoming
classrooms
.
This
white
nationalist
understanding
of
who
belongs
in
the
United
States
inspires
white
supremacist
mass
murders
and
attacks
continually
in
the
United
States
.
We
see
this
white
nationalist
ideology
continually
on
campus
as
well
.
Shortly
after
9
11
,
three
Pakistani
students
were
intially
denied
jobs
by
a
professor
who
understood
their
nationality
only
as
equivalent
to
terrorism
read
un
American
.
Much
more
recently
,
the
Duke
College
Republicans
planned
an
event
entitled
,
The
American
Muslim
Patriot
or
Insurgent
?
That
such
an
absurdly
dichotomous
understanding
of
American
Muslims
permeates
Duke’s
campus
begs
not
only
the
question
what
is
it
that
we’re
learning
here
?
’
but
also
who
is
education
for
?
’
The
Consortium
may
not
have
produced
a
significant
number
of
government
employees
or
focused
enough
attention
on
projects
of
national
interest
,
but
our
University
has
been
more
than
willing
to
further
both
of
those
goals
.
Our
engineers
received
millions
of
dollars
to
design
security
aparati
for
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
,
and
a
current
course
is
offered
in
partnership
with
the
Department
of
Defense
.
The
class
,
entitled
,
Hacking
for
Defense
,
is
also
inexplicably
,
and
somewhat
laughably
,
advertised
as
service
learning
.
The
Duke
Program
in
American
Grand
Strategy
hosts
events
on
the
Middle
East
,
but
in
keeping
with
an
oppositional
framework
,
uses
language
such
as
crisis
and
turmoil
.
Meanwhile
,
in
our
interactions
with
ourselves
and
our
peers
we
continue
to
reproduce
neoliberal
logics
.
Though
UNC
responded
directly
to
the
Department
of
Education
in
a
letter
just
a
few
days
ago
,
Duke
has
been
noticeably
silent
on
the
topic
.
Meanwhile
student
groups
such
as
Students
for
Justice
in
Palestine
at
Duke
and
UNC
have
been
mobilizing
against
the
Department’s
censorship
and
in
an
effort
to
deconstruct
the
imperialist
assumptions
of
the
investigation
.
Clearly
,
we
cannot
allow
the
University
to
position
itself
as
the
neutral
arbitrator
of
knowledge
.
While
Duke
is
positioned
as
the
antithesis
of
Islamophobia
and
the
champion
of
intellectual
engagement
in
this
situation
,
we
know
that
to
not
be
true
.
Duke
actively
perpetuates
othering
Islamophobic
and
Orientalist
logic
through
partnerships
with
the
Department
of
Homeland
Security
,
programs
such
as
American
Grand
Strategy
and
within
most
classroom
instruction
.
We
must
demand
more
from
our
academic
communities
and
institutions
of
higher
learning
.
And
,
while
defending
programs
from
funding
threats
,
we
must
also
be
willing
not
only
to
name
nationalist
or
imperialist
or
colonial
logic
in
our
instruction
and
thinking
,
but
also
to
actively
work
towards
deconstructing
the
Others
which
we
are
continually
taught
to
imagine
.
It’s
the
beginning
of
the
new
school
year
,
and
for
The
Chronicle
opinion
section
that
means
an
onslaught
of
patronizing
columns
directed
towards
first
years
written
by
people
vastly
unqualified
to
give
any
sort
of
life
advice
.
I
have
no
interest
in
reading
how
one
year
at
Duke
taught
you
the
importance
of
stress
management
or
how
it
took
time
for
you
to
make
this
new
environment
feel
like
a
home
.
I
don’t
need
a
thousand
words
to
tell
me
that
college
life
presents
you
with
a
lot
of
options
but
you
should
probably
only
commit
to
a
few
;
and
while
we’re
at
it
even
though
it’s
off
topic
I
may
as
well
mention
that
the
column
about
Radical
Randys
pissed
me
off
too
.
I’ve
been
here
for
three
years
now
and
I
still
feel
just
as
dumb
when
it
comes
to
navigating
this
school
as
I
was
in
my
first
week
.
I’ve
never
met
with
my
major
advisor
,
I’ve
never
set
up
a
Flunch
,
and
I
don’t
know
where
half
the
buildings
are
.
In
a
lot
of
ways
I’m
even
less
grounded
than
I
was
as
a
freshman
.
I
spent
a
good
year
and
a
half
caring
way
too
much
about
mixer
themes
or
who
was
bringing
who
to
date
functions
.
If
I
really
think
about
it
,
there’s
honestly
only
one
piece
of
advice
I
feel
completely
qualified
to
give
Don’t
eat
the
fish
in
West
Union
.
Last
week
I
made
the
poor
decision
of
purchasing
the
salmon
at
JB’s
Chop
House
and
it
only
took
a
few
short
hours
before
I
was
projectile
vomiting
into
the
drain
of
my
tub
shower
.
It
was
easily
the
third
worst
food
poisoning
I’ve
ever
encountered
,
topped
only
by
a
tainted
batch
of
Bojangles
purchased
in
Rougemont
,
North
Carolina
,
and
the
mayonnaise
topped
hamburger
I
ate
in
Damascus
,
Syria
.
It’s
not
the
first
time
I’ve
been
burned
by
JB’s
either
.
The
blackened
salmon
tip
pineapple
goulash
they
served
last
year
passed
through
my
system
quicker
than
Pete
Davidson
goes
through
hastily
chosen
girlfriends
.
But
let’s
not
just
pick
on
JB’s
.
Freshman
year
I
frequented
the
poke
stand
at
Ginger
and
Soy
;
however
,
after
biting
into
a
cartilage
chunk
the
size
of
Paul
Giamatti’s
left
testicle
for
the
third
time
,
I
decided
to
call
it
quits
.
The
sushi
place
whose
name
I
don’t
know
has
fish
,
but
they
also
think
that
cream
cheese
belongs
in
Japanese
inspired
cuisine
,
so
if
I
were
you
I’d
steer
clear
.
I
think
the
root
of
the
West
Union
fish
problem
is
really
just
an
identity
issue
.
West
Union
is
a
great
college
dining
hall
,
one
that
I’m
grateful
to
have
had
for
all
of
my
four
years
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
just
a
dining
hall
.
The
sleek
stand
facades
and
glass
architecture
give
the
vendors
the
confidence
to
attempt
dishes
they
have
no
business
attempting
.
It’s
kinda
like
how
that
doughy
white
guy
fiending
for
a
pickup
game
in
Wilson
thinks
he
can
take
pull
up
threes
just
because
he’s
rocking
a
newly
purchased
pair
of
Kyrie
5’s
.
You
can
peacock
all
you
want
but
you’re
not
fooling
anyone
after
you
start
gasping
for
air
three
trips
up
and
down
the
court
.
Prioritizing
the
brochure
over
user
experience
is
very
on
brand
for
Duke
.
The
quality
of
West
Union
food
isn’t
bad
,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
design
of
the
building
was
much
more
important
to
Duke
than
the
food
itself
.
Duke
got
rid
of
Central
Campus
because
it
looked
like
an
East
German
DMV
,
but
Central
was
super
fun
and
most
people
I
know
who
lived
there
loved
it
.
Duke
doesn’t
have
a
frat
row
and
any
on
campus
parties
are
strictly
monitored
,
but
that
just
makes
parties
move
off
campus
where
Duke
can
pawn
off
the
problem
onto
Durham
residents
and
the
local
police
.
Not
sure
what
any
of
that
really
has
to
do
with
West
Union
fish
but
I
have
to
write
another
hundred
words
for
The
Chronicle
to
publish
this
and
I’m
running
out
of
fish
jokes
faster
than
Pete
Davidson
goes
through
hastily
chosen
girlfriends
.
I
guess
I’ll
wrap
this
up
the
way
any
good
advice
column
does
with
an
unnecessary
and
overly
sentimental
restatement
of
my
simple
premise
.
Here
goes
nothing
Duke
can
be
a
hard
place
to
adjust
to
,
and
sometimes
you
may
feel
overly
stressed
or
like
you’re
missing
out
on
countless
opportunities
.
But
one
thing
you
should
miss
out
on
is
the
fish
in
West
Union
,
cause
that
s
will
destroy
your
insides
.
For
my
history
class
,
I
was
assigned
to
read
a
chapter
from
Home
and
Work
Housework
,
Wages
,
and
the
Ideology
of
Labor
in
the
Early
Republic
,
written
by
Jeanne
Boydston
,
an
American
historian
.
And
as
I
settled
into
a
couch
at
Lilly
,
sipping
my
fifth
cup
of
coffee
that
day
,
I
read
the
lines
that
Boydston
wrote
about
women
in
the
19th
century
,
about
how
they
were
glorified
into
a
domestic
sphere
and
romanticized
as
a
bright
and
central
orb
,
whose
genial
light
kindles
with
soft
and
heavenly
radiance
upon
the
scene
of
loveliness
which
invites
him
to
rest
.
Ugh
.
But
as
I
continued
to
study
the
words
of
Boydston
,
I
became
increasingly
aware
and
unsettled
that
these
lines
resonated
something
within
me
,
stirring
up
whispers
of
past
memories
and
experiences
within
my
own
life
,
that
only
confirmed
the
ever
present
influence
of
social
gender
spheres
today
.
Boydston
wrote
this
article
about
the
1800s
,
a
time
,
in
my
mind
,
that
seemed
irrelevant
to
my
everyday
life
with
its
antiquated
social
customs
and
norms
.
So
why
did
I
relate
to
the
idea
of
the
women
she
portrayed
painted
with
an
inherent
grace
,
a
comforting
touch
,
a
haven
of
solace
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
?
While
we
have
obviously
made
political
,
economic
,
and
social
progress
since
the
1800s
regarding
gender
equality
,
one
aspect
of
traditional
womanhood
that
is
still
expected
of
women
today
is
the
role
of
a
nurturer
.
From
the
moment
girls
are
bought
their
first
Barbies
and
have
baby
dolls
shoved
in
their
arms
,
we
are
instinctively
taught
to
take
care
of
others
.
Moms
traditionally
stay
home
with
children
when
they
are
sick
,
maternity
leave
is
a
norm
over
parental
leave
,
and
women
nannies
are
preferred
over
male
ones
.
The
culture
of
our
society
still
ingrains
us
with
this
idea
that
we
,
as
women
,
must
take
those
,
especially
those
who
are
helpless
and
in
need
,
under
our
wing
.
It’s
no
wonder
then
that
William
Alcott
,
an
American
author
who
Boydston
quoted
in
her
work
,
proclaimed
that
A
woman
.
.
.
has
duties
to
perform
to
the
sick
and
to
the
well
to
the
young
and
to
the
ages
;
duties
even
to
domestic
animals
.
’
Although
perhaps
not
as
explicit
as
Alcott
put
it
,
women
today
,
based
on
these
existing
ideas
from
the
1800s
,
are
still
expected
to
fulfill
this
social
role
.
Granted
,
nurturing
may
be
at
least
partly
due
to
evolutionary
processes
in
early
societies
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
social
customs
,
traditional
gendering
of
roles
,
and
a
patriarchal
society
have
sustained
this
culture
for
far
too
long
.
In
my
own
life
,
specifically
in
certain
relationships
,
I
recognize
now
I
took
on
the
expected
role
of
nurturer
and
caretaker
,
based
on
my
identity
as
a
woman
,
over
time
and
perhaps
in
situations
I
should
not
have
.
Regardless
of
how
someone
treated
me
,
I
was
there
to
empathize
with
struggles
I
would
never
really
understand
,
to
provide
calming
advice
,
and
a
comforting
hand
to
hold
.
It
felt
good
to
be
needed
,
to
be
able
to
watch
over
someone
that
I
loved
deeply
,
and
to
be
relied
on
in
the
harder
times
.
But
in
the
times
between
,
the
effort
,
time
,
and
love
I
invested
would
be
faced
by
biting
comments
that
would
make
me
question
the
true
intentions
of
these
people
.
When
they
needed
me
,
I
was
there
.
When
they
didn’t
need
me
,
I
was
annoyingly
still
there
.
It
was
a
continuing
cycle
,
weaved
secretly
between
the
rest
of
our
relationship
them
hurting
me
,
them
needing
me
,
me
comforting
and
nurturing
regardless
.
When
I
finally
came
to
terms
with
behavior
that
was
intentionally
wrong
,
hurtful
,
and
uncalled
for
,
I
knew
there
was
only
a
limit
to
my
forgiveness
and
the
continuation
of
my
role
as
a
nurturer
within
this
cycle
.
Perhaps
this
is
what
separates
me
from
women
of
the
1800s
the
ability
to
take
back
what
I
had
given
so
many
times
and
what
was
not
valued
anymore
.
I
can’t
take
back
my
actions
in
the
past
,
but
I
can
take
back
what
was
stripped
of
so
many
women
years
ago
the
lifelong
label
as
nurturer
,
caretaker
,
one
that
puts
others’
needs
above
her
.
Women
were
depicted
as
a
great
reservoir
of
love
,
the
water
works
of
moral
influence
,
from
which
go
out
ten
thousand
tubes
,
conveying
the
ethereal
essences
of
her
nature
,
and
diffusing
them
quietly
over
the
secret
chambers
of
man's
inner
being
,
and
their
economic
dependence
and
livelihood
depended
on
fulfilling
this
role
.
But
mine
does
not
.
Yes
,
it
feels
good
to
be
needed
.
But
at
what
cost
?
The
relationships
I
cultivated
were
not
all
bad
,
but
they
were
highly
characterized
by
my
role
as
a
nurturer
.
I
couldn’t
leave
someone
in
need
,
even
if
they
had
been
intentionally
unkind
to
me
before
.
It’s
hard
to
walk
away
from
people
you
love
,
but
in
the
long
term
,
it’s
even
harder
to
bear
the
constant
hurt
of
someone
you
invested
so
much
time
and
love
in
.
Boydston
stated
about
women
in
her
work
Against
its
callousness
,
she
offered
nurturance
.
Against
its
ambition
,
she
pitted
her
self
effacement
and
the
modesty
of
her
needs
.
Against
its
materialism
,
she
held
up
the
twin
shields
of
morality
and
spiritual
solace
.
The
traditional
woman
put
her
husband’s
needs
above
hers
in
the
act
of
nurturing
him
,
and
in
a
society
now
where
I
have
a
choice
,
even
for
people
I
have
loved
in
a
way
I
never
could
have
imagined
,
I
could
never
do
that
to
myself
.
Being
nurturing
is
overrated
,
and
forgiveness
is
overrated
sometimes
too
.
Women
of
the
1800s
didn’t
have
a
choice
they
were
bound
to
this
ever
present
idea
with
the
shackles
of
male
social
and
economic
dominance
.
But
even
if
our
natural
instincts
of
nurturing
haven’t
changed
,
we
do
have
the
choice
now
to
take
it
back
,
to
put
ourselves
first
,
and
to
be
unapologetic
for
doing
it
.
In
the
past
two
weeks
,
I
have
learned
that
many
student
organizations
at
Duke
are
rather
exclusive
.
Many
of
them
require
auditions
.
Some
of
my
auditions
went
well
,
others
not
so
much
.
As
fate
would
have
it
,
I
didn’t
qualify
for
anything
.
Let’s
step
back
.
Coming
to
Duke
two
weeks
ago
was
both
exciting
and
exhausting
.
Any
freshman
can
tell
you
how
disorienting
the
first
several
days
were
with
meetings
,
information
sessions
,
and
the
need
to
understand
life
at
Duke
.
This
confusion
soon
subsided
,
and
I
began
asking
,
what’s
here
,
what
more
can
I
do
?
I
realized
I
didn’t
have
anything
to
do
except
plan
for
class
;
I
needed
extracurriculars
.
I
went
with
my
gut
instinct
at
the
beginning
of
the
semester
.
Sign
up
for
everything
,
cut
clubs
out
later
.
And
it
comedy
club
,
formed
largely
in
reaction
to
the
cliquey
ness
of
Inside
Joke
.
Are
all
clubs
destined
to
become
extremely
selective
?
Will
it
only
be
a
few
more
years
until
DUST
also
requires
stand
up
auditions
from
members
hoping
to
join
?
It’s
important
to
remember
just
how
many
amazing
some
of
our
open
spaces
are
at
Duke
.
Anyone
can
come
to
Chapel
service
,
we
have
plenty
of
club
and
IM
sports
,
and
there
is
,
of
course
,
the
common
room
.
There
is
still
definitely
community
without
being
in
a
competitive
group
;
what
do
students
lose
through
the
audition
process
?
They
lose
the
chance
to
try
.
Not
to
try
out
,
but
to
really
try
.
To
attempt
debate
,
ultimate
frisbee
,
or
any
other
competitive
activity
to
see
how
good
they
might
be
.
To
see
if
they
even
enjoy
the
club
at
all
.
Because
club
auditions
are
based
on
outward
skill
,
not
enthusiasm
,
dedication
,
or
work
ethic
.
I
did
bungle
my
debate
rebuttal
,
but
is
that
really
indicative
of
my
overall
potential
in
debate
?
The
most
competitive
members
of
any
group
usually
start
at
the
bottom
and
improve
over
time
.
Charlie
Parker
supposedly
bombed
one
of
his
first
auditions
to
play
live
music
.
Of
course
,
he
then
became
the
at
least
one
of
the
greatest
jazz
alto
saxophonists
of
all
time
.
A
club
that
allowed
many
members
to
try
the
activities
for
a
few
weeks
until
auditions
began
,
or
until
they
simply
chose
to
stop
attending
,
would
have
a
more
accurate
reading
of
both
skill
and
dedication
among
its
members
.
There
would
be
greater
cost
in
dealing
with
a
larger
base
to
begin
with
,
but
perhaps
the
pay
off
would
be
worth
it
.

I
just
really

to
get
into
Mock
Trial
.
Early
into
the
spring
semester
of
my
freshman
year
at
Duke
,
I
was
sitting
in
the
front
row
of
Environmental
Hall
1114
,
fidgeting
with
the
leaves
of
paper
in
front
of
me
my
outline
for
our
in
class
debate
on
Malthus
and
his
theory
on
population
growth
and
control
.
I
was
assigned
the
anti
Malthusian
stance
,
which
is
to
say
,
I
was
to
argue
that
population
growth
was
not
a
real
concern
,
and
that
the
planet
had
enough
resources
to
support
all
of
us
.
I
did
fine
.
The
other
side
,
the
one
arguing
that
the
planet
was
rapidly
reaching
its
maximum
limit
of
human
occupants
and
that
population
control
was
the
only
way
to
ensure
a
livable
future
,
did
fine
,
too
.
The
class
period
ended
and
we
packed
up
and
left
that
was
that
.
We
were
done
.
It
wasn’t
until
almost
a
year
later
that
I
began
to
truly
understand
Malthus
in
context
.
Although
traction
behind
his
theory
died
down
after
an
initial
splash
,
a
revival
occurred
mid
to
late
20th
century
and
attracted
new
followers
called
neo
Malthusians
.
These
modern
Malthusians
generally
adhere
to
the
original
theory
,
with
a
stronger
focus
on
two
aspects
the
degradation
of
the
environment
and
contraception
as
a
possible
solution
to
overpopulation
.
I
agree
that
we
must
protect
the
environment
.
That
is
not
my
problem
with
these
neo
Malthusians
.
My
problem
is
with
their
second
focus
contraception
and
how
it
manifests
as
eugenics
,
full
stop
.
Contraception
,
historically
,
has
played
a
huge
role
in
eugenics
.
It’s
the
logical
conclusion
there
is
the
fit
Read
White
,
affluent
,
abled
,
Western
European
people
and
the
unfit
,
Read
Black
,
poor
,
disabled
,
Eastern
European
people
and
since
we
don’t
want
more
of
the
unfit
,
we
offer
them
contraceptives
.
Or
we
sterilize
them
by
force
.
White
supremacy
and
eugenics
might
not
be
explicit
in
neo
Malthusian
thought
,
but
look
under
the
hood
and
you
will
see
them
.
Harry
Fairfield
Osborn
Jr
,
author
of
which
is
credited
as
the
spark
for
the
neo
Malthusian
movement
,
openly
identified
as
a
distinguished
Aryan
enthusiast
.
Club
of
Rome
,
a
prominent
neo
Malthusian
non
profit
,
was
once
headed
by
David
Rockefeller
,
who
has
expressed
his
concerns
about
overpopulation
on
many
occasions
.
His
family’s
private
foundation
,
the
Rockefeller
Foundation
,
funded
Nazi
eugenicists
in
the
early
20th
century
.
Garrett
Hardin
,
author
of
the
famous
Tragedy
of
the
Commons
theory
and
creator
of
lifeboat
ethics
,
wrote
in
his
book
,
that
there
was
a
need
to
restrict
unqualified
reproductive
rights
,
and
expressed
support
for
race
specific
intelligences
namely
the
claim
that
African
Americans’
average
IQ
was
85
.
So
it’s
clear
that
these
neo
Malthusians
are
simultaneously
white
supremacists
and
eugenicists
.
But
is
it
possible
that
they’re
right
about
the
peril
of
overpopulation
?
The
short
answer
is
no
.
The
long
answer
is
it’s
complicated’
and
I
admit
I’m
no
expert
,
but
even
if
Malthus
were
right
about
everything
,
the
harm
produced
by
his
theory
still
stands
painfully
relevant
and
permanent
.
I
didn’t
know
any
of
this
when
I
was
a
freshman
,
preparing
for
that
class
debate
.
Malthus
,
his
subsequent
followers
,
and
their
marriage
to
white
supremacy
and
eugenics
weren’t
anywhere
in
the
pre
debate
reading
material
.
My
professor
and
the
TAs
were
silent
during
the
debate
itself
,
simply
taking
notes
and
calling
time
.
It
wasn’t
until
one
year
and
one
shocking
discovery
later
that
their
silence
began
to
sound
loud
.
There
is
a
deafening
silence
throughout
the
rest
of
the
field
of
Environmental
Science
,
too
.
A
new
iteration
of
Malthusian
thought
is
on
the
rise
eco
fascism
.
It’s
what
it
says
on
the
tin
environmentalism
through
the
lens
of
white
supremacy
and
genocide
.
The
Christchurch
shooter
explicitly
identified
as
an
eco
fascist
.
The
El
Paso
shooter
was
similarly
inspired
,
believing
that
the
only
way
to
avoid
ecological
collapse
was
if
we
can
get
rid
of
enough
people
.
It
might
seem
like
the
wrong
people’
are
co
opting
the
well
meaning
field
of
environmental
science
,
but
,
when
put
into
historical
context
,
eco
fascism
comes
into
view
as
the
logical
offspring
of
early
environmental
thought
.
This
part
of
environmental
science
is
ugly
.
I
understand
the
impetus
to
want
to
teach
Malthus
for
the
sake
of
his
historical
importance
,
while
omitting
the
violent
legacy
of
his
work
,
but
I
don’t
think
it’s
right
.
During
the
debate
my
freshman
year
,
Malthus’
side
and
the
anti
Malthus’
side
were
presented
as
equally
valid
and
rational
,
even
though
any
true
,
contemporary
proponent
of
Malthus
would
want
me
personally
sterilized
and
culled
.
The
omission
of
the
historical
context
surrounding
Malthus
is
not
just
irresponsible
it
is
an
outright
act
of
violence
.
It
normalizes
dangerous
ideologies
and
attracts
white
supremacists
and
eugenicists
into
our
fold
.
As
educators
,
students
and
members
of
the
Duke
community
,
we
have
a
responsibility
to
reject
them
all
,
to
explicitly
condemn
eco
fascism
in
all
its
forms
past
and
present
.
But
most
importantly
,
we
have
a
responsibility
to
welcome
others
.
To
protect
our
most
vulnerable
friends
and
community
members
.
To
assure
them
that
they
have
a
space
in
the
lifeboat
,
too
that
we
all
do
.
To
lean
off
the
side
,
grasp
their
reaching
hand
and
hoist
them
up
.
Hello
it's
Better
Laettner
Than
Never
where
I
say
a
few
things
that
I
think
we
should
discuss
.
To
start
,
I
believe
in
the
Second
Amendment
right
to
bear
arms
,
but
I
don't
believe
that
it
is
an
unlimited
right
.
Just
as
we
have
a
right
to
free
speech
,
yet
there
are
still
limitations
on
certain
forms
of
speech
,
there
should
be
more
restrictions
on
gun
ownership
,
preferably
a
full
ban
on
assault
style
weapons
.
This
time
it's
serious
.
It’s
time
to
say
it
now
.
The
mass
shooting
at
El
Paso
was
only
a
month
ago
now
.
The
shooter’s
manifesto
cited
inspiration
from
the
Christchurch
mosque
shootings
in
New
Zealand
and
mentioned
white
genocide
conspiracy
theory
.
For
reference
,
the
Atlantic’s
article
,
What
Conservative
Pastors
Didn’t
Say
After
El
Paso
,
in
which
Slotkin
argues
that
the
attitudes
and
traditions
which
shape
American
culture
unfolded
from
the
socio
psychological
struggles
of
European
settlers
to
claim
land
and
drive
out
Native
Americans
,
often
by
violent
acts
.
Wilson
also
pointed
out
that
KKK
literature
includes
this
idea
of
regeneration
through
violence
in
an
effort
to
get
back
to
a
pure
society
.
The
dangers
of
these
violent
ideologies
persist
and
have
strongly
re
emerged
in
our
highly
media
centered
world
and
staunchly
partisan
world
.
Clearly
many
Americans
see
gun
violence
as
a
problem
.
In
fact
,
the
majority
of
Americans
support
new
measures
on
gun
control
now
.
But
if
the
current
administration
won't
do
anything
to
reduce
access
to
these
weapons
,
how
else
can
we
make
change
?
Specifically
as
it
relates
to
gun
violence
in
connection
to
white
supremacy
,
which
is
ideologically
linked
to
Christianity
,
nbsp
;
where
is
the
response
from
the
Christian
majority
and
the
Christian
church
?
Why
is
there
lack
of
response
?
It
is
probably
because
Christians
do
not
want
to
identify
with
these
violent
acts
,
that
they
do
not
ackonowledge
the
danger
of
white
supremacist
ideology
.
nbsp
;
The
sentiment
following
9
11
seemed
to
define
Islam
as
a
dangerous
religion
,
when
in
fact
,
any
religion
can
be
skewed
by
power
grabbing
individuals
to
suit
their
prerogatives
.
Lets
not
forget
that
European
Christians
Crusades
.
Today
,
I
don't
see
politically
aligned
Christians
saying
the
same
thing
about
the
violence
of
Christian
white
supremacists
.
One
of
the
first
people
to
use
the
term
Christianist
was
author
and
editor
Andrew
Sullivan
.
Sullivan
defines
the
term
in
his
Christianism
is
an
ideology
,
politics
,
an
ism
.
The
distinction
between
Christian
and
Christianist
echoes
the
distinction
we
make
between
Muslim
and
Islamist
It
is
the
belief
that
religion
dictates
politics
and
that
politics
should
dictate
the
laws
for
everyone
,
Christian
and
non
Christian
alike
.
I
asked
Dean
Wilson
if
he
believed
that
the
church
has
a
strong
incentive
to
respond
to
the
threat
of
white
supremacy
.
He
responded
,
absolutely
,
but
wondered
to
what
extent
the
Church
does
respond
.
He
said
,
The
church
has
a
responsibility
to
deal
with
these
issues
,
yet
for
many
of
the
evangelical
churches
there
is
this
idea
that
the
church
has
an
impact
on
the
individual
,
but
should
not
get
into
social
issues
.
I
know
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
discuss
,
but
I
truly
believe
that
we
need
to
see
a
strong
,
definitive
response
from
the
Church
against
this
violence
.
I
know
Christians
whose
faith
have
been
shaken
in
the
wake
of
the
violence
often
associated
with
right
wing
Christianity
in
America
that
we
see
today
.
I
know
people
who
now
question
the
relation
between
their
faith
and
that
of
their
Christian
counterparts
who
exercise
this
type
of
violence
.
I
am
a
person
who
was
shaken
by
the
lack
of
discussion
and
clarity
on
this
subject
and
the
ignorance
of
the
suffering
of
others
and
the
lack
of
empathy
expressed
in
these
highly
nationalist
views
.
It
is
high
time
that
Christians
take
a
strong
response
on
violent
Christianism
and
white
supremacy
in
America
.
A
strong
response
would
emphatically
state
why
these
violent
ideals
do
not
align
with
the
faith
.
A
strong
response
would
seek
out
those
members
of
the
church
who
are
vulnerable
to
targeted
recruitment
and
finding
a
community
to
help
them
.
A
strong
response
would
involve
taking
part
in
this
discussion
and
supporting
mental
health
awareness
.
And
a
strong
response
would
include
new
gun
control
measures
.
Church
leaders
and
members
alike
should
more
deeply
reflect
on
their
responsibility
to
mitigate
this
increasing
epidemic
of
white
supremacist
terrorism
.
Dear
Felicia
,
As
an
international
student
at
Duke
,
I
appreciate
your
initiative
to
join
the
International
Association
and
connect
with
those
who
share
different
life
experiences
from
you
.
Although
Duke
is
still
within
your
30
mile
radius
around
Cary
,
North
Carolina
,
it
is
indeed
an
excellent
place
to
explore
different
perspectives
.
Here
,
everyone
has
a
chance
to
build
relationships
with
fellow
students
from
diverse
backgrounds
,
and
engage
together
in
reflections
about
culture
and
identity
.
This
is
a
remarkable
learning
experience
with
lots
to
be
gained
,
but
only
if
approached
with
the
right
attitude
.
Unfortunately
,
Felicia
,
your
article
came
with
deeply
problematic
underpinnings
and
gross
misrepresentations
of
international
students
.
You
criticized
the
fact
that
Facebook
leads
people
to
believe
that
all
international
students
are
stupidly
rich
.
Your
article
,
on
the
other
hand
,
portrays
all
international
students
as
people
who
are
fleeing
from
tragedy
stricken
territories
,
desperately
vying
for
an
opportunity
to
reconstruct
our
pitifully
broken
lives
in
the
United
States
of
America
,
a
wondrous
land
of
opportunity
and
freedom
.
Both
are
miserably
wrong
.
Citing
a
few
examples
of
political
conflict
and
natural
disaster
,
you
articulated
your
sympathy
for
international
students
and
the
difficulties
some
of
us
go
through
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
those
stories
are
worth
mentioning
they
are
valid
struggles
and
genuine
lived
experiences
of
our
peers
.
I
do
,
however
,
question
your
selection
of
those
particular
stories
to
share
.
Was
it
because
you
believed
those
were
common
experiences
amongst
international
students
,
or
because
those
were
easy
sensational
stories
that
align
with
your
underlying
view
that
international
students
are
escaping
persecution
of
some
sort
to
seek
hope
in
your
country
?
A
language
of
pathos
and
passivity
runs
throughout
your
article
.
International
students
are
forced
to
pay
for
CPT
writing
classes
,
screwed
over
by
the
United
States
Citizenship
and
Immigration
Services
USCIS
,
forced
to
band
together
to
petition
,
and
risk
being
kicked
out
of
the
country
.
When
you
could
have
described
the
challenges
international
students
face
in
many
different
ways
,
you
chose
a
tone
of
victimisation
.
But
we
are
not
victims
,
we
are
not
merely
passive
recipients
of
your
country’s
actions
.
The
opportunity
to
pursue
education
at
an
intellectually
rigorous
environment
like
Duke
is
not
an
act
of
mercy
extended
to
pairs
of
begging
hands
.
We
all
worked
hard
to
be
here
,
and
decided
to
come
here
out
of
our
own
volition
,
fully
aware
that
there
will
be
hurdles
to
overcome
.
In
the
face
of
obstacles
such
as
OPT
delays
or
visa
complications
,
if
you
can
offer
only
pity
,
then
please
respectfully
stay
in
your
lane
.
Before
you
feel
proud
about
your
attempt
to
speak
up
for
international
students
,
please
recognize
your
own
biases
.
Friendships
with
international
students
should
not
serve
as
a
platform
for
domestic
students
to
claim
their
privileges
,
as
it
risks
implying
that
international
students
are
less
privileged
.
The
United
States
is
not
the
best
country
in
the
world
.
Just
as
some
of
us
grew
up
amidst
geopolitical
conflict
which
you
can
only
read
about
,
some
of
us
grew
up
reading
about
school
shootings
and
terrorist
attacks
that
may
very
well
have
had
a
close
impact
on
your
life
.
Some
of
us
are
excited
about
building
our
future
careers
in
the
United
States
,
others
might
rather
live
elsewhere
.
Some
of
us
miss
home
dearly
,
others
enjoy
the
independence
of
being
several
long
haul
flights
away
from
home
.
nbsp
;
And
these
are
not
binaries
many
of
us
are
somewhere
in
between
.
Felicia
,
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
,
and
a
wide
array
of
subjective
experiences
for
anyone
living
anywhere
.
I
am
glad
you
have
grown
to
appreciate
the
boredom
of
North
Carolina
,
but
to
me
,
an
international
student
,
your
article
is
just
at
best
an
egocentric
proclamation
of
how
much
perspective
you
think
you
have
,
and
at
worst
an
embarrassing
revelation
of
how
much
perspective
you
do
not
have
.
Recognition
,
albeit
rare
,
has
come
to
workers
in
different
ways
.
Since
Wall
,
thousands
of
workers
have
helped
to
build
and
maintain
the
university
,
but
very
few
have
been
memorialized
in
the
way
Wall
has
.
Laborers
like
Lucius
Jeter
,
an
African
American
stonesman
,
built
the
school
yet
have
no
permanent
memorial
on
our
campus
.
Jeter
worked
on
the
foundations
of
West
Campus
in
the
1930s
and
later
on
the
Allen
Building
in
the
1950s
.
Although
the
labor
force
included
blacks
and
whites
,
university
documents
reveal
that
Duke's
campus
was
built
mostly
by
underpaid
black
labor
.
The
white
laborers'
stories
,
however
,
are
far
more
visible
.
Even
when
black
stonemasons
are
acknowledged
in
university
documents
,
it
is
in
patronizing
language
.
They
are
usually
referred
to
as
helpers
and
considered
not
as
qualified
as
white
laborers
.
They
also
earned
about
68
cents
for
every
dollar
their
white
counterparts
earned
.
In
the
latter
half
of
the
20th
century
,
issues
arose
in
the
treatment
and
wages
of
the
maids
and
janitors
.
In
a
1959
article
in
,
Duke
students
John
Strange
and
Scott
Stevens
exposed
the
shockingly
low
wages
of
the
university’s
225
nonacademic
workers
.
Janitors
were
paid
90
cents
an
hour
,
and
maids
were
making
only
65
cents
,
amounting
to
19
.
50
per
week
.
Beyond
low
wages
,
the
maids
and
janitors
had
no
holidays
or
sick
leave
.
Publisher
L
.
E
.
Austin
referred
to
these
conditions
as
peonage
.
Sixty
years
later
,
the
fight
continues
.
As
of
2019
,
Duke
employs
701
full
time
service
workers
,
85
595
workers
of
which
are
minorities
520
blacks
,
106
whites
,
and
55
Hispanics
.
Although
the
wage
has
increased
to
a
closer
to
living
15
per
hour
substantially
above
the
federal
and
state
minimum
wage
of
7
.
25
per
hour
,
the
most
recent
change
to
housekeeping
schedules
has
required
Duke’s
residential
housekeeping
staff
to
work
weekends
,
with
the
same
number
of
hours
and
pay
,
at
the
alleged
request
of
the
students
.
Under
the
rules
,
housekeepers
have
less
time
to
spend
with
family
,
attend
religious
services
,
or
tend
to
other
obligations
.
Shawn
Easterling
,
who
protested
the
move
,
is
facing
consequences
.
I’m
under
suspension
right
now
for
failure
to
come
in
on
Saturdays
and
Sundays
,
he
says
.
Back
at
home
,
Easterling
has
a
lot
to
deal
with
;
weekends
are
precious
.
As
he
told
me
,
My
Saturdays
and
Sundays
are
important
to
me
and
my
family
,
considering
we
just
lost
our
son
,
who
was
10
years
old
,
last
year
Thanksgiving
Eve
.
So
between
that
and
dealing
with
the
loss
of
our
child
,
our
religious
beliefs
are
very
important
to
us
.
We're
dealing
with
that
the
best
we
can
,
and
to
come
here
and
have
to
deal
with
what
I'm
dealing
with
,
which
is
not
just
affecting
me
but
affecting
my
family
as
well
.
Maybe
if
management
had
taken
the
time
to
understand
their
workers
,
to
talk
to
them
and
listen
to
their
concerns
,
they
wouldn’t
have
been
so
quick
to
suspend
Easterling
.
He
believes
the
administration
could
improve
working
conditions
by
adhering
to
a
simple
concept
be
human
.
Understand
that
you’re
a
human
being
and
that
you
have
human
beings
working
for
you
would
be
his
advice
to
leadership
.
Every
day
is
not
a
good
day
for
us
and
every
day
is
not
a
good
day
for
them
,
either
.
It
would
help
if
they
understood
that
.
Throughout
Duke’s
history
of
labor
,
there
has
been
a
common
thread
a
lack
of
empathy
for
its
workers
.
For
people
like
Easterling
and
Gooch
,
that
thread
persists
to
this
day
.
As
the
Duke
community
begins
to
rethink
its
labor
policies
and
practices
,
it’s
important
that
we
understand
the
experiences
and
contributions
of
people
like
Oliver
Harvey
and
Shawn
Easterling
.
Only
then
can
we
bridge
the
disconnect
between
those
who
make
policy
and
those
whom
the
policy
affects
.
Coffee
chats
,
info
sessions
,
networking
events
;
you’ve
surely
heard
of
,
participated
in
,
or
been
ranted
to
about
some
career
development
task
over
the
past
few
weeks
.
Career
recruiting
season
is
in
full
swing
on
campus
many
of
us
are
applying
to
full
time
jobs
,
and
a
quarter
of
us
have
just
begun
our
final
year
at
Duke
.
The
real
world
is
approaching
,
fast
.
This
school
is
a
place
with
a
sense
of
endless
opportunity
a
springboard
to
a
great
career
,
a
perfect
life
.
But
that
approach
fails
to
hit
the
mark
in
one
particular
area
romance
.
Everything
at
Duke
is
about
prepping
for
lifelong
success
;
but
dating
doesn’t
have
to
be
.
If
you
asked
the
average
taken
Duke
student
,
they’d
probably
tell
you
forever
is
the
goal
.
But
should
it
be
?
I
understand
the
pressure
to
strive
for
forever
;
I
spent
a
good
portion
of
my
Duke
career
with
a
long
term
partner
.
We
dated
for
all
of
sophomore
year
and
stayed
together
during
my
junior
fall
abroad
.
We
,
like
all
couples
,
had
our
share
of
issues
,
but
the
good
times
were
made
great
by
a
level
of
compatibility
neither
of
us
had
experienced
before
.
However
,
the
return
to
campus
following
that
semester
abroad
made
it
clear
that
we
had
both
grown
personally
,
but
in
different
and
ultimately
less
compatible
directions
.
That
impossibly
strong
connection
had
faded
.
Some
of
you
have
undoubtedly
had
similar
experiences
.
nbsp
;
Our
new
selves
,
each
better
and
stronger
in
its
own
right
,
just
weren’t
right
for
each
other
.
For
many
of
us
,
the
personal
growth
native
to
higher
education
hasn’t
settled
enough
for
forever’
compatibility
to
be
possible
.
Duke
is
stressful
the
term
pressure
cooker’
springs
immediately
to
mind
.
The
often
overwhelming
experiences
which
make
our
time
at
Duke
so
valuable
for
career
development
also
motivate
personal
growth
at
breakneck
pace
.
Look
back
a
few
years
.
Are
your
views
,
passions
and
friends
unchanged
?
Mine
certainly
aren’t
,
and
I’m
better
for
it
.
Amid
all
this
change
,
who’s
to
say
that
the
person
you
fall
in
love
with
during
the
immensely
stressful
read
vulnerable
,
deeply
formative
period
that
is
your
time
at
Duke
will
be
the
same
person
you’d
choose
in
a
few
years
?
That
thought
exercise
is
relatively
futile
anyway
,
because
the
person
you
fell
for
will
have
changed
,
too
.
Those
who
study
abroad
may
seem
to
have
it
particularly
hard
when
it
comes
to
dating
.
The
line
abroad
changed
me
is
typically
a
sarcastic
,
slightly
comical
remark
,
but
there
is
truth
in
the
humor
.
You
do
indeed
return
from
abroad
a
mildly
different
person
,
and
this
is
a
hurdle
for
many
relationships
here
.
But
these
changes
happen
even
if
we
are
home
.
I
was
abroad
in
Sydney
,
Australia
go
,
seriously
and
my
girlfriend
at
the
time
was
on
campus
in
Durham
,
but
we
both
changed
during
that
semester
;
it’s
not
about
abroad
,
the
Duke
experience
itself
changes
us
too
.
So
yes
,
dating
in
college
can
be
hard
.
The
question
is
how
do
we
make
the
most
of
it
here
,
at
Duke
?
Some
of
my
friends
have
said
they’d
love
to
find
a
lifelong
partner
while
at
Duke
since
everyone
is
so
smart
and
driven
.
While
that’s
logical
,
and
something
I’ve
considered
myself
,
the
truth
is
we
have
years
of
growth
left
before
we
are
ready
for
that
kind
of
committed
relationship
.
Finding
the
one
at
Duke
should
be
left
for
picking
your
dream
job
,
not
a
partner
.
Dating
in
college
is
not
akin
to
the
ways
we
prepare
for
the
future
while
studying
here
;
its
purpose
is
entirely
different
.
When
prepping
for
a
career
,
everything
is
about
outcomes
.
What
or
who
you
know
can
have
a
substantial
impact
on
where
you
end
up
and
what
you
earn
,
so
there
is
a
mad
scramble
to
figure
it
all
out
now
.
In
the
romantic
arena
,
we
should
be
less
focused
on
the
endgame
,
and
more
focused
on
the
memories
we
can
make
in
the
present
.
We
,
as
Duke
students
,
love
to
be
in
control
it’s
part
of
why
the
well
defined
tracks
to
consulting
or
finance
careers
are
so
popular
.
nbsp
;
But
dating
is
far
less
formulaic
.
While
we
should
all
control
our
academic
and
career
arcs
,
there
is
solace
in
accepting
that
changes
in
romantic
desires
coming
from
gradual
and
,
in
my
experience
,
almost
imperceivable
personal
growth
,
are
more
difficult
to
micromanage
.
Of
course
in
time
,
emotions
will
stabilize
.
Until
then
,
the
messy
business
of
self
discovery
is
not
something
we
should
neglect
or
postpone
.
It’s
best
for
us
to
do
that
difficult
work
here
and
now
,
in
the
relative
safety
of
the
Duke
bubble
.
Go
on
dates
,
find
the
people
and
qualities
that
make
you
happy
in
a
relationship
,
and
learn
from
the
parts
which
don’t
.
The
truth
is
,
our
time
at
Duke
is
finite
,
and
the
realities
of
a
lifelong
relationship
will
be
more
clear
to
us
after
settling
into
true
adulthood
.
For
now
,
don’t
assume
happiness
and
long
term
commitment
are
the
same
thing
,
because
with
the
freedoms
of
early
adulthood
come
more
moments
of
emotional
erraticism
than
any
of
us
would
like
to
admit
.

your

For
me
,
incorporating
this
here
and
now
mindset
into
my
life
has
proven
incredibly
fulfilling
and
valuable
,
and
it’s
certainly
healthier
than
perpetually
struggling
to
feel
happy
in
a
relationship
aimed
at
forever
.
Have
I
dated
someone
since
that
serious
relationship
from
sophomore
year
?
Yeah
,
sort
of
.
And
critically
,
in
this
more
recent
relationship
,
we
chose
to
enjoy
making
memories
together
and
worry
less
about
a
label
or
the
endgame
.
While
you’re
still
finding
yourself
,
consider
taking
the
same
approach
.
Too
often
at
Duke
,
we
plan
for
the
future
and
forget
to
live
in
the
present
.
You
have
years
to
find
the
love
of
your
life
,
so
,
while
you’re
still
young
and
growing
,
focus
on
the
love
of
2019
,
and
enjoy
it
to
the
fullest
.
And
then
,
when
the
erraticism
of
youth
has
faded
,
go
find
what
makes
you
happy
long
term
.
What
do
you
and
a
Duke
student
from
the
1800s
have
in
common
?
You
both
probably
wanted
to
fix

campus

Although

However
,
I
find
that
there

no

When

she
would

This
historical
information
holds
the
key
to
understanding
the

the

she
wrote

We’re

into

,
which
means
you’ve
probably
had

was
your
summer
?
conversation
dozens
of
times
now
.
But
this
question
is
more
than
seasonal
small
talk
.
It’s
an
appraisal
.
At
Duke
,
we’re
taught
to
make
every
summer
meaningful
.
Not
necessarily
meaningful
for
ourselves
meaningful
for
our
careers
.
Our
anxieties
about
being
underlie
part
of
this
pressure
.
But
the
part
that
feels
the
most
stifling
is
the
judgment
from
others
.
Yesterday
,
my
boyfriend
remarked
that
we
tend
to
evaluate
the
impressiveness
of
our
peers’
summers
on
a
scale
.
At
the
top
,
with
ten
out
of
tenpoints
,
are
high
paying
internships
with
powerful
companies
in
cities
like
New
York
or
San
Francisco
.
If
you
know
someone
who
worked
at
Google
this
summer
or
if
you
are
that
someone
you’re
familiar
with
the
unending
praise
these
jobs
elicit
.
We
recognize
that
these
summer
jobs
may
lead
to
future
prominence
in
that
person’s
field
.
Thus
,
they
deserve
our
pride
,
jealousy
,
and
insecurity
all
at
once
.
Then
there
are
the
unpaid
internships
.
Again
,
better
if
with
a
well
known
company
but
throwing
around
terms
like
think
tank
and
start
up
may
distract
your
listener
just
enough
to
impress
them
,
bumping
you
up
a
point
or
two
.
Did
you
work
in
STEM
or
policy
?
Were
you
in
a
big
city
?
If
not
,
and
especially
if
the
internship
was
in
your
hometown
,
you’re
unlikely
to
be
perceived
as
a
threat
.
But
if
you
can
show
off
just
enough
to
induce
mild
feelings
of
fear
and
inferiority
,
you’re
golden
.
Jobs
in
the
service
industry
lie
towards
the
bottom
of
the
scale
.
We
don’t
recognize
the
time
spent
as
a
waitress
or
working
the
counter
at
Macy’s
to
be
meaningful
because
they
seem
unlikely
to
affect
an
individual’s
chances
at
their
ideal
job
or
grad
school
.
When
he
wasn’t
on
a
ship
shadowing
Naval
officers
,
my
boyfriend
was
a
lifeguard
at
the
pool
five
minutes
from
his
house
.
If
he
kept
his
NROTC
activities
out
of
the
conversation
,
he
estimates
his
summer
would
be
ranked
a
two
out
of
ten
.
Whether
we
acknowledge
it
or
not
,
we
all
size
each
other
up
based
on
our
achievements
.
Not
because
we
.
And
if
I
ever
ask
you
about
your
summer
,
know
this
I’ll
take
that
story
over
your
elevator
pitch
any
day
.
Any
attempt
to
engage
in
academic
discourse
with
students
of
economics
or
political
economy
will
often
reveal
an
inability
for
these
students
to
intellectually
contextualize
their
arguments
.
Rather
than
embracing
flirtations
with
heterodox
economic
schools
,
most
students
will
find
themselves
reverting
to
very
orthodox
classroom
arguments
,
without
knowing
multiple
courses
in
the
history
of
economic
thought
.
Earlier
generations
of
economists
appreciated
the
fact
that
research
into
the
history
of
thought
and
the
economic
history
that
appropriately
contextualizes
the
debates
of
the
past
shines
light
on
past
events
and
exhibits
the
astonishing
resemblance
between
historical
events
share
and
current
ones
.
This
approach
augments
our
understanding
of
the
science
,
as
the
merits
and
faults
of
past
approaches
are
scrutinized
and
distilled
into
novel
insights
into
the
big
issues
facing
economists
today
.
It
is
difficult
to
argue
that
students
would
be
less
able
to
comprehend
and
analyze
contemporary
policy
issues
with
a
working
knowledge
of
the
writings
and
modern
implications
of
the
Knight
Hayek
controversy
regarding
capital
theory
,
the
Wicksell
Davidson
debate
on
price
stability
,
and
the
infamous
contest
of
business
cycle
theories
between
the
London
School
of
Economics
and
Cambridge
in
the
1930s
,
to
name
just
a
few
.
Indeed
,
many
of
the
most
important
advances
in
economic
science
were
guided
by
understanding
how
different
schools
of
thought
interacted
with
each
other
.
Professor
Milton
Friedman
,
for
instance
,
made
enormous
headway
in
the
Keynesian
dominated
mainstream
of
macroeconomics
by
reinvigorating
the
ideas
of
Irving
Fisher
and
the
earlier
advocates
of
the
quantity
theory
of
money
in
his
extraordinarily
thorough
historical
work
on
the
American
monetary
system
.
Ludwig
von
Mises
would
never
have
developed
his
revolutionary
theory
of
monetary
institutions
and
their
macroeconomic
effects
if
not
for
his
study
of
Wicksell
,
Bohm
Bawerk
,
and
the
British
classical
economists
of
old
.
Even
Karl
Marx
read
and
wrote
on
Adam
Smith
and
David
Ricardo
,
and
they
no
doubt
shaped
his
thinking
,
be
it
positively
or
negatively
.
Since
the
financial
crisis
of
2008
,
mainstream
economists
have
been
wracking
their
brains
for
answers
,
and
many
seemingly
innovative
approaches
to
reconstructing
the
profession
bear
remarkable
similarities
to
the
theories
of
yesterday
.
This
is
unsurprising
.
Rather
than
seeing
economics
as
a
series
of
ideas
that
build
on
top
of
each
other
and
benefit
from
vigorous
debate
,
it
has
become
a
field
that
is
overly
focused
on
adding
more
and
more
frictions
to
DSGE
models
that
have
abstracted
so
far
from
reality
,
that
they
could
use
a
solid
grounding
in
theory
that
can
be
found
in
the
history
of
thought
.
Rather
than
simply
having
students
memorize
stock
and
flow
diagrams
,
undergraduates
who
have
studied
the
history
of
thought
will
be
better
equipped
to
think
independently
and
present
ideas
in
a
tradition
more
consistent
with
the
intellectualism
is
to
be
expected
of
students
at
an
elite
university
.
More
importantly
,
a
sound
understanding
of
the
history
of
ideas
has
the
potential
to
inject
excitement
and
life
into
the
otherwise
dismal
science
.
Putting
names
,
personalities
,
and
lives
to
theories
that
are
often
presented
as
lifeless
graphs
and
equations
can
prove
to
encourage
typically
uninterested
students
to
pick
up
economics
.
There’s
something
infinitely
more
fascinating
about
the
story
of
the
stubborn
Piero
Sraffa
taking
on
future
Nobel
Prize
winner
F
.
A
.
von
Hayek
on
the
role
of
interest
rates
in
business
cycles
,
than
a
series
of
regressions
suggesting
a
strong
correlation
between
a
dip
in
remittance
payments
and
the
emergence
of
economic
recessions
.
The
history
of
economic
thought
was
what
turned
political
economy
into
a
full
time
passion
for
me
,
and
I
am
sure
that
other
potential
economists
might
find
something
that
excites
them
in
the
field’s
rich
history
.
In
the
recent
Democratic
presidential
debate
,
Senator
Elizabeth
Warren
reflected
the
concerns
of
millions
of
Americans
,
Republicans
and
Democrats
,
when
she
voiced
her
plan
to
cancel
student
debt
for
95
percent
nbsp
;
of
Americans
.
As
the
student
loan
bubble
becomes
increasingly
large
,
the
nitty
gritty
of
the
policy
surrounding
government
loans
moves
further
into
the
sphere
of
mainstream
political
discourse
.
The
government
really
started
to
get
involved
with
student
loans
in
1958
,
with
the
Federal
Perkins
Loan
program
and
the
National
Defense
Student
Loan
program
.
The
Perkins
Loan
was
a
needs
based
program
that
offered
loans
at
a
5
fixed
interest
rate
.
In
1965
,
with
the
first
iteration
of
the
Higher
Education
Act
,
doubled
down
on
state
intervention
in
the
student
loan
sphere
by
establishing
a
guaranteed
student
loan
program
,
through
the
Federal
Family
Education
Loan
Program
.
Since
then
,
the
federal
government
has
proceeded
to
interfere
more
and
more
in
the
loan
market
,
distorting
outcomes
further
,
leading
to
a
history
of
significant
instability
.
Over
the
summer
,
I
had
the
opportunity
to
skim
nearly
all
the
Government
Accountability
Office
GAO
and
Congressional
Research
Service
CRS
reports
pertaining
to
student
loan
policy
.
The
nbsp
;
vast
majority
of
these
reports
were
either
complaints
or
warnings
about
bad
incentives
,
overly
cheap
credit
,
a
lack
of
accountability
,
corruption
,
and
general
waste
nbsp
;
due
to
an
immunity
from
market
signals
.
It
is
clear
that
,
since
credit
is
too
cheap
,
too
many
people
are
borrowing
too
much
money
,
and
they
simply
can’t
afford
to
pay
back
much
of
their
loans
.
Beyond
that
,
state
controlled
bureaucracy
is
nbsp
;
not
susceptible
to
the
pressures
of
market
based
competition
,
leading
to
bloated
administrations
,
unbalanced
budgets
,
and
painfully
substandard
service
.
Instead
of
handing
the
state
as
large
as
yearly
Medicare
spending
.
Not
only
would
it
create
enormous
moral
hazard
for
future
borrowers
,
who
might
see
periodic
bailouts
as
inevitable
,
and
borrow
for
education
that
they
do
not
need
,
and
will
likely
not
use
,
but
even
a
one
time
bailout
would
disproportionately
benefit
the
wealthy
nbsp
;
by
a
staggering
amount
about
half
of
all
student
loan
debt
is
held
by
the
top
25
of
households
by
income
.
Such
an
enormous
subsidy
would
also
do
little
to
curb
the
rising
costs
of
education
that
have
been
plaguing
American
families
for
years
nbsp
;
and
would
probably
incentivize
colleges
to
increase
costs
even
more
,
given
the
increased
demand
that
subsidies
create
.
Also
at
the
core
of
this
issue
is
the
culture
that
suggests
that
everyone
needs
some
degree
.
Many
jobs
don’t
in
fact
need
training
at
the
college
level
,
and
more
people
are
paying
for
degrees
that
simply
don’t
have
the
same
payoff
that
they
used
to
.
What
we
might
need
is
a
fundamental
shift
in
our
educational
system
that
prioritizes
practical
,
job
related
skills
.
More
urgently
,
however
,
we
need
to
move
towards
a
higher
education
market
that’s
more
strongly
rooted
nbsp
;
in
market
principles
,
rather
than
in
utopian
faith
in
the
capabilities
of
the
state
,
that
has
time
and
time
again
failed
to
achieve
its
desired
goals
.
After
two
years
of
construction
,
Duke
University
will
celebrate
Sept
.
28
the
unveiling
of
the
campus’
newest
structure
,
the
state
of
the
art
Karsh
Alumni
and
Visitors
Center
.
Walk
,
run
,
or
drive
on
Duke
University
Road
or
Campus
Drive
to
view
the
20
,
200
square
foot
pavilion
.
Though
ostensibly
open
to
everyone
alumni
,
community
members
,
students
and
staff
alike
ultimately
,
this
new
structure
is
an
alumni
and
visitor
center
,
a
25
million
suite
of
event
spaces
and
offices
.
It
may
be
open
to
the
community
at
large
,
but
it
is
not
for
the
community
,
begging
the
question
where
are
the
community
spaces
on
campus
?
For
whom
are
they
built
and
where
?
And
what
,
as
a
recent
column
asks
,
do
these
differential
investments
in
spaces
tell
us
about
who
is
valued
and
cared
for
on
this
campus
?
Our
campus
spaces
,
new
and
old
,
reflect
the
histories
and
values
of
the
University
.
In
front
of
the
Duke
Chapel
stands
an
elevated
,
larger
than
life
statue
of
James
B
.
Duke
,
dedicated
in
1935
.
The
statue
is
located
on
what
is
now
Abele
Quad
,
the
center
of
West
Campus
in
front
of
the
Duke
Chapel
.
Julian
Abele
,
the
Black
architect
of
West
Campus
,
was
recognized
significantly
only
in
2016
with
the
renamed
Quad
and
a
commemorative
plaque
on
the
ground
.
This
exemplifies
the
afterthought
towards
space
for
marginalized
groups
.
The
Center
for
Multicultural
Affairs
CMA
,
a
space
to
think
critically
about
diversity
and
social
justice
is
on
the
lowest
level
of
the
Bryan
Center
alongside
La
Casa
,
a
space
for
Latinx
students
and
the
Asian
American
Pacific
Islander
Bridge
for
Action
Solidarity
and
Education
AAPI
BASE
.
The
Hindu
Students
Association
HSA
shares
a
single
prayer
room
in
the
basement
of
the
Bryan
Center
Greenhouse
with
the
Buddhist
Community
.
The
Student
Disability
Access
Office
SDAO
is
on
Oregon
Street
,
Central
Campus
where
students
no
longer
live
and
buses
less
frequently
go
.
Most
of
these
community
spaces
for
cultural
and
identity
groups
materialized
as
the
result
of
advocacy
and
activism
from
students
and
supporting
staff
and
faculty
members
.
While
some
make
efforts
to
create
inclusive
,
welcoming
spaces
,
others
have
chosen
to
uphold
the
exclusionary
nature
of
the
university
.
It
has
been
just
over
a
year
since
the
Mary
Lou
Williams
Center
a
place
made
in
contrast
to
other
campus
spaces
by
and
for
Black
students
was
vandalized
.
The
past
academic
year
saw
its
fair
share
of
hate
and
bias
incidents
that
have
largely
seen
a
lack
of
decisive
action
to
address
the
issues
.
Just
yesterday
,
Duke
Student
Government
unanimously
rejected
the
request
from
students
to
make
Young
Life
,
a
Christian
organization
that
explictly
bars
LGBTQ
members
from
leadership
positions
,
an
official
student
group
.
This
highlights
how
power
is
not
just
in
the
hands
of
administration
,
but
also
in
the
hands
of
students
.
Certain
students
will
matriculate
and
enter
the
upper
echelons
of
alumni
,
donors
with
the
resources
to
make
decisions
and
leave
a
legacy
of
how
space
is
constructed
on
campus
.
These
gothic
stones
and
immense
glass
walls
don’t
at
first
tell
of
white
supremacy
,
ableism
,
or
xenophobia
.
Their
grandeur
seems
to
say
nothing
of
absence
,
until
you
look
closer
.
The
decision
to
allocate
space
or
not
to
student
groups
,
the
design
of
our
living
spaces
,
the
donations
given
to
certain
construction
projects
but
not
others
,
the
defacement
of
cultural
spaces
,
the
threats
against
those
that
ask
for
recognition
these
are
the
markers
of
a
University
steeped
in
white
supremacy
and
cultural
imperialism
.
As
we
think
about
engaging
with
violent
,
uncomfortable
histories
we
cannot
forget
the
ways
that
those
histories
are
present
.
They
are
intercalated
in
the
physical
geography
,
architectural
landscape
and
administrative
and
campus
decision
making
processes
.
In
this
way
,
is
necessary
that
we
consider
belonging
grounded
in
,
yet
more
than
,
location
.
We
must
,
simultaneously
,
be
actively
moving
to
create
a
community
that
transcends
physicality
.
How
will
we
care
for
each
other
within
this
campus
and
once
we
have
moved
beyond
?
Like
most
universities
,
Duke
takes
pride
in
its
history
.
When
I
came
here
as
a
first
year
,
the
tour
guides
and
administrators
were
eager
to
teach
me
about
Duke’s
founders
and
key
historical
figures
,
like
J
.
B
.
Duke
and
Washington
Duke
.
As
a
student
,
I
am
constantly
reminded
of
their
legacy
.
Their
names
are
plastered
on
libraries
,
hotels
and
residence
halls
across
campus
.
But
there
is
a
gaping
hole
in
our
history
.
While
this
university
was
established
by
the
wealth
of
white
men
like
the
Dukes
and
the
Alspaughs
,
it
was
built
by
the
Lucius
Jeters
and
the
Oliver
Harveys
the
predominantly
black
workers
who
have
devoted
decades
of
their
lives
to
Duke
.
The
laborers
and
service
workers
are
an
invisible
layer
that
keeps
this
institution
running
.
Sadly
,
their
indelible
contribution
goes
unacknowledged
.
Following
the
2017
rally
in
Charlottesville
and
the
subsequent
national
dialogue
on
symbols
and
history
,
Duke
began
to
engage
with
its
own
past
a
past
that
is
rife
with
injustice
and
labor
exploitation
.
After
the
removal
of
the
Robert
E
.
Lee
statue
from
nbsp
;
the
Chapel
,
President
Vincent
Price
convened
a
Commission
on
Memory
and
History
,
which
would
begin
efforts
to
recognize
those
individuals
whose
labor
was
the
foundation
of
the
wealth
that
created
Duke
University
and
whose
hands
built
our
campus
.
And
yet
the
Commission
,
whose
goals
included
recognizing
laborers
,
included
no
non
academic
staff
.
In
its
efforts
to
create
a
greater
sense
of
equity
,
the
University
engaged
in
a
conversation
that
nbsp
;
omitted
the
same
people
who
are
absent
from
its
buildings
and
memorials
the
workforce
.
How
do
workers
feel
about
Duke’s
efforts
to
reexamine
and
memorialize
the
past
?
How
much
does
a
conversation
around
history
and
memory
have
bearing
on
their
concerns
today
as
members
of
the
Duke
community
?
Charles
Gooch
started
working
at
Duke
when
he
was
17
.
Now
63
,
he
has
been
a
Duke
employee
for
46
years
.
As
former
president
of
Local
77
,
the
Duke
labor
union
that
represents
housekeeping
employees
,
Gooch
is
an
outspoken
critic
of
the
University’s
labor
practices
.
In
fact
,
he
stepped
down
from
the
presidency
in
2017
to
protest
what
he
considered
unfair
changes
to
Duke’s
housekeeping
schedule
and
currently
works
at
Marketplace
.
His
years
on
campus
,
however
,
have
not
dulled
the
stark
terms
in
which
he
describes
Duke’s
relationship
with
its
labor
force
.
We’re
going
back
to
the
slave
mentality
,
he
asserted
in
our
conversation
.
Gooch
describes
a
hierarchy
that
does
not
divide
itself
along
historical
racial
lines
of
black
and
white
,
but
along
positions
of
power
the
black
community
Slave
mentality
is
about
the
overseer
.
When
you
look
at
the
old
slave
pictures
,
you
have
a
black
on
their
horse
overseeing
other
blacks
.
And
they
don't
know
how
to
treat
their
workforce
because
they
just
know
they
got
a
title
.
So
I've
been
seeing
this
all
across
Duke
the
overseer
mentality
.
Gooch
started
working
at
Duke
in
1974
.
I’ve
seen
all
the
changes
,
he
says
.
When
I
came
here
most
of
the
supervisor
managers
was
white
.
Now
we
got
most
of
the
supervisor
managers
are
black
.
Gooch
believes
that
Duke
is
taking
advantage
of
these
power
dynamics
by
hiring
more
black
managers
.
Ten
years
to
this
day
,
everybody
from
Duke
Housing
and
Residence
Life
,
everybody
we
deal
with
,
even
the
administrators
,
they
only
give
us
black
people
.
There
are
hardly
any
whites
we
deal
with
,
he
says
.
nbsp
;
Gooch
believes
the
hiring
is
designed
to
insulate
the
university
from
charges
of
racism
.
It's
a
good
technique
,
he
admits
in
a
grimly
cynical
tone
.
When
I
see
how
the
black
management
treating
the
black
workforce
,
I
did
not
see
this
when
I
had
white
supervisor
management
.
Shawn
Easterling
,
a
former
housekeeper
in
Craven
dorm
,
agrees
that
there
is
a
racial
hierarchy
.
Duke
is
a
plantation
,
he
states
candidly
.
The
way
you
are
talked
to
and
the
way
you
are
handled
you’re
treated
like
a
slave
on
a
plantation
pretty
much
.
You
may
get
yelled
at
.
There’s
just
a
lot
to
this
place
that’s
done
behind
the
scenes
Y’all
don’t
hear
that
stuff
.
Easterling
has
worked
at
Duke
since
2006
,
but
his
roots
here
go
further
back
.
Born
in
Duke
Hospital
in
1971
,
Easterling
has
been
a
life
long
resident
of
Durham
.

The
issues
that
Easterling
sees
now
at
Duke
remind
him
of
the
stories
he
has
heard
from
his
aunt
,
who
worked
at
Duke
in
the
1960’s
as
a
nurse
.
According
to
his
aunt
,
management
would
feed
the
workers
days
old
food
.
I
heard
stories
of
my
aunt
from
the
1960’s
,
things
like
feeding
them
food
from
two
or
three
days
ago
that
they
had
already
cooked
.
They
would
serve
it
to
the
service
workers
and
that
would
be
what
they
had
to
eat
.
Like
Easterling
,
Gooch
thinks
that
these
modern
tensions
in
the
workforce
are
part
of
an
historic
recurrence
.
We’re
regressing
,
because
history
is
repeating
itself
,
Gooch
explains
.
Duke
just
brings
workers
in
and
say
I
got
a
warm
body
.
Put
them
over
there
.
Do
this
.
’
You
just
don’t
know
what
I’ve
been
dealing
with
for
years
.
In
spite
of
all
this
,
Gooch
says
he
appreciates
what
the
university
has
given
him
.
But
he
wants
to
see
Duke
improve
.
His
message
to
leadership
Put
people
first
.
You're
making
your
money
.
Put
the
value
back
into
the
people
.
It’s
worth
noting
that
Gooch
and
Easterling’s
experiences
are
not
representative
of
the
entire
Duke
labor
force
.
They
are
two
stories
out
of
many
.
Other
service
workers
,
who
did
not
want
to
be
quoted
for
fear
of
retribution
,
had
minor
qualms
about
their
jobs
but
made
no
serious
allegations
about
mistreatment
.
That
said
,
Gooch
and
Easterling
deserve
to
have
their
voices
heard
;
their
lived
experiences
of
injustice
cannot
be
divorced
from
the
university’s
labor
history
and
practices
.
And
while
Duke
has
made
improvements
,
it
must
continue
its
efforts
to
make
everyone
,
especially
the
people
most
central
to
its
daily
operations
,
feel
welcome
here
.
A
few
days
ago
,
I
was
with
some
friends
who
were
enjoying
cigarettes
on
campus
,
before
a
gentleman
stopped
us
to
inform
these
smokers
that
smoking
was
illegal
on
Duke’s
campus
.
Notwithstanding
the
falsity
of
his
statement
,
the
incident
got
me
thinking
more
broadly
about
the
incoming
smoking
ban
on
Duke’s
campus
,
and
perhaps
why
Duke
should
take
a
step
back
and
reconsider
its
efforts
.
In
April
of
last
year
,
the
Duke
administration
announced
that
it
will
stop
selling
cigarettes
in
the
University
Store
nbsp
;
by
July
2018
,
and
ultimately
prohibit
the
consumption
of
all
combustible
tobacco
products
on
any
property
owned
by
Duke
,
starting
in
July
2020
.
This
initiative
was
part
of
the
more
extensive
Healthy
Duke
initiative
it
started
in
April
2017
.
While
it
is
admirable
nbsp
;
to
promote
a
healthier
campus
,
it
seems
slightly
strange
that
Duke
has
suddenly
decided
to
ban
smoking
and
force
smokers
into
cessation
programs
,
while
students
brazenly
drink
themselves
into
hospitalization
,
hangover
,
and
likely
long
term
liver
damage
.
There
are
several
reasons
why
this
well
meaning
ban
may
be
counter
productive
.
First
,
one’s
decision
to
smoke
is
an
issue
of
freedom
.
.
As
a
private
institution
,
Duke
has
every
right
to
engage
in
such
prohibition
efforts
on
its
property
,
but
not
without
clear
overtones
of
demeaning
paternalism
.
The
overall
purpose
of
these
efforts
,
at
least
according
to
official
Duke
sources
,
is
to
save
members
of
the
Duke
community
from
themselves
.
The
science
is
clear
that
regularly
smoking
cigarettes
can
have
disastrous
health
consequences
,
but
what
is
less
clear
is
why
Duke
should
decide
for
Duke
students
and
employees
whether
they
should
or
should
not
take
this
risk
.
Beyond
this
,
a
campus
wide
attack
on
smoking
punishes
some
groups
more
than
others
.
Individuals
of
lower
socioeconomic
status
are
more
likely
to
be
smokers
than
those
higher
in
the
social
and
economic
rungs
.
Students
on
other
campuses
have
nbsp
;
complained
of
a
disproportionate
impact
on
international
students
.
A
smoking
ban
runs
counter
to
our
school’s
mission
of
fostering
cultural
and
geographic
diversity
.
nbsp
;
Many
students
on
Duke’s
campus
come
from
countries
where
smoking
is
seen
to
be
part
of
daily
life
.
These
students
are
more
likely
to
have
become
addicted
to
cigarettes
before
arriving
at
Duke
,
only
to
come
here
and
find
that
their
habits
are
unwelcome
,
and
they
must
conform
to
these
new
standards
created
by
the
social
engineers
in
charge
.
Additionally
,
if
we
are
simply
concerned
about
the
health
effects
of
tobacco
,
it
seems
unnecessary
to
penalize
cigar
and
pipe
smokers
as
well
.
While
cigar
smoking
is
not
without
risk
,
it
is
far
less
risky
than
cigarette
smoking
,
in
many
important
respects
.
Similarly
,
Duke
has
refrained
from
adding
chew
tobacco
,
which
greatly
increases
the
risk
for
various
cancers
without
any
evidence
that
it
helps
people
quit
smoking
,
to
its
list
of
proscribed
substances
.
One
might
even
say
that
it
is
less
about
the
health
risks
embraced
by
smokers
,
and
more
about
the
risks
of
those
who
have
chosen
not
to
smoke
.
After
all
,
second
hand
smoking
is
almost
as
,
if
not
just
as
bad
as
actually
smoking
,
right
?
Some
studies
have
nbsp
;
have
nbsp
;
found
no
correlation
between
low
rates
of
passive
smoking
and
lung
cancer
.
In
his
summary
of
the
paper
,
Daniel
Fisher
points
out
that
Only
among
women
who
had
lived
with
a
smoker
for
30
years
or
more
was
there
a
relationship
that
the
researchers
described
as
borderline
statistical
significance
.
’
Recent
research
with
large
populations
has
also
found
that
heart
disease
risks
from
second
hand
smoking
were
greatly
overstated
,
especially
at
the
low
levels
of
passive
smoking
most
Duke
students
are
exposed
to
on
campus
.
Duke
claims
that
it
has
considered
the
health
effects
of
tobacco
consumption
and
the
various
groups
that
will
be
affected
by
this
ban
,
yet
such
consideration
must
necessarily
entail
a
more
moderate
approach
.
Instead
of
embracing
a
policy
that
will
entail
enormous
enforcement
costs
if
it
is
even
enforced
at
all
,
perhaps
Duke
could
consider
creating
designated
smoking
areas
.
Duke
should
be
commended
for
its
efforts
to
help
smokers
who
want
to
quit
,
but
one
should
always
be
skeptical
of
one
size
fits
all
policies
.
Instead
of
relegating
smokers
into
the
darkness
,
such
a
policy
would
be
far
more
consistent
with
protecting
non
smokers
,
while
respecting
the
diversity
of
our
community
.
Staring
blankly
into
the
search
bar
,
you
wait
for
inspiration
to
strike
your
hovering
fingertips
.
Infinite
possibility
glares
across
the
screen
.
An
hour
later
,
you
find
yourself
twenty
six
now
twenty
seven
tabs
deep
into
your
browser
.
Your
laptop
hisses
with
strain
,
attempting
to
scrounge
up
enough
bandwidth
to
keep
up
with
your
game
of
tab
volleying
.
Your
desperate
scramble
to
find
research
starts
with
a
bust
.
I’m
familiar
with
this
vicious
cycle
.
Last
fall
,
I
was
your
prototypical
first
year
,
bursting
with
nervous
energy
at
the
limitless
array
of
opportunities
.
Seemingly
within
arm’s
reach
,
I
expected
complete
ease
of
access
and
a
buffet
of
options
to
choose
from
.
Only
one
of
these
preconceptions
rang
true
.
Duke
markets
itself
as
both
a
liberal
arts
and
premier
research
institution
.
So
it’s
shocking
that
an
institution
that
boasts
a
6
1
student
to
faculty
ratio
,
numerous
graduate
programs
and
research
partnerships
at
the
local
,
state
,
and
national
level
can’t
amass
enough
visible
opportunities
to
meet
student
demand
.
As
it
stands
,
the
discovery
of
many
mentored
research
opportunities
operates
under
primitive
practices
cold
calls
,
door
knocking
,
rapid
fire
emailing
.
Maybe
you’re
lucky
and
stumble
into
a
professor
seeking
an
undergraduate
assistant
;
perhaps
you
get
a
favorable
response
to
one
of
your
emails
.
But
for
many
,
this
likelihood
is
a
gamble
at
best
.
Coupled
with
the
precarity
and
happenstance
nature
of
finding
opportunities
,
the
infrastructure
of
discovery
seems
to
prioritize
a
very
narrow
idea
of
research
,
largely
STEM
fields
.
And
even
then
,
there’s
an
overwhelming
amount
of
entry
points
DukeList
,
the
Social
Science
Research
Institute
SSRI
,
Muser
,
the
Duke
Undergraduate
Research
Support
Office
DURS
,
summer
fellowships
,
Bass
Connections
the
list
goes
on
.
Sprawling
in
reach
,
the
pathways
to
research
involvement
aren’t
always
intuitive
.
While
there’s
a
certain
whimsy
about
unexpectedly
bumping
into
opportunities
,
it’s
not
a
reliable
method
for
those
whose
interest
in
research
is
both
unequivocal
and
inevitable
.
So
just
how
many
students
actually
conduct
research
?
According
to
Duke’s
calculations
,
roughly
53
percent
of
students
graduate
with
research
experience
,
which
seems
to
be
a
fair
enough
statistic
to
throw
out
to
clusters
of
prospective
students
;
but
something
doesn’t
quite
add
up
.
I
wonder
how
the
sample
was
collected
.
Were
the
answers
self
reported
?
And
if
that’s
the
case
,
then
how
is
research
defined
by
the
institution
and
students
,
respectively
?
Research
is
deeply
embedded
in
the
curriculum
.
And
so
,
following
this
logic
,
everyone
has
participated
in
research
at
Duke
,
not
53
percent
of
the
undergraduate
body
,
but
100
percent
.
Under
the
Trinity
Arts
amp
;
Sciences
graduation
requirements
,
the
Modes
of
Inquiry
serve
to
foster
engagement
in
intellectual
themes
that
help
prepare
students
for
life
beyond
Duke
.
Among
these
is
research
,
coded
as
R
.
Understandably
,
an
itemized
list
of
R
tags
on
your
transcript
doesn’t
have
the
same
effect
as
participation
in
competitive
,
high
impact
lab
research
.
This
illuminates
a
bigger
problem
.
Research
is
ubiquitous
at
a
place
like
Duke
.
It
seeps
into
faculty
conversations
and
nudges
its
way
into
casual
asides
between
students
.
It’s
stamped
at
the
top
of
resumes
.
But
while
it’s
tossed
around
flippantly
,
research
doesn’t
have
a
clear
definition
.
Some
of
the
assumptive
imagery
that
immediately
comes
to
mind
is
hordes
of
lab
coat
clad
students
,
nervously
pipetting
fluids
or
analyzing
petri
dishes
.
Of
course
,
this
generalization
does
not
reflect
the
true
breadth
,
variety
,
and
flavor
of
research
conducted
at
Duke
right
here
,
right
now
.
But
these
labels
highlight
how
common
perceptions
shape
how
people
narrowly
define
research
.
Research
knows
no
bounds
;
it
is
the
process
and
product
of
itself
.
The
act
of
defining
would
,
in
effect
,
fabricate
an
intellectual
ceiling
on
what
is
and
what
could
be
.
Still
,
it’s
not
the
etymology
of
the
word
itself
that
should
be
scrutinized
but
the
cultural
norms
that
make
research
and
an
excitement
for
discovery
possible
.

The
amount
of
knowledge
production
happening
at
Duke
is
truly
unprecedented
.
And
Duke
,
in
the
business
of
commercializing
discovery
and
fostering
cross
institutional
partnerships
,
depends
on
a
vibrant
culture
of
inquiry
.
While
researchers
themselves
have
a
share
in
the
responsibility
to
cultivate
this
richness
,
students
are
also
important
stakeholders
in
the
equation
.
Transparency
and
intuitive
publicizing
of
opportunities
can
help
preserve
the
unbridled
intellectual
potential
of
the
undergraduate
student
body
.
Because
if
we
are
to
maximize
our
institution’s
potential
,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
university
culture
to
welcome
student
researchers
of
all
backgrounds
,
interests
,
and
aspirations
.
My
life
can
be
characterized
by
the
30
mile
radius
around
Cary
,
North
Carolina
,
where
I
went
to
public
school
for
K
12
and
have
lived
in
the
same
house
forever
.
Perhaps
because
of
that
,
I
decided
to
join
Duke’s
International
Association
IA
during
the
end
of
my
freshman
year
.
By
now
,
I’m
used
to
the
shocked
looks
whenever
I
mention
my
involvement
.
underqualified
choice
to
speak
for
international
students
.
As
the
only
domestic
student
in
the
club
,
there
are
plenty
of
times
when
I’ve
felt
out
of
place
.
And
although
I’ve
sought
to
understand
the
perspective
of
being
a
foreigner
,
I
realize
now
that
there
are
aspects
of
the
international
student
experience
that
I’ll
never
be
able
to
replicate
.
A
couple
of
lessons
to
share
If
you
actually
sit
in
West
Union
,
you’ll
find
that
probably
half
of
the
conversations
around
you
are
about
recruiting
.
The
never
ending
grind
to
find
employment
is
a
constant
worry
among
Duke
students
.
The
difficulty
of
snagging
that
banking
gig
,
however
,
is
multiplied
if
you’re
international
.
In
order
to
work
in
the
United
States
,
international
students
who
are
typically
here
under
an
F1
visa
are
restricted
to
only
being
able
to
work
for
companies
that
will
sponsor
them
.
At
the
Duke
career
fair
last
year
,
there
were
a
whopping
22
employers
who
offered
sponsorship
.
To
make
matters
worse
,
the
amount
of
time
that
students
can
work
is
limited
.
Students
can
obtain
work
authorization
in
two
methods
OPT
Optional
Practical
Training
and
CPT
Curricular
Practical
Training
.
Deciding
which
type
of
authorization
to
use
can
be
another
perplexing
process
.
In
order
to
use
CPT
at
Duke
,
you’re
forced
to
pay
for
a
writing
class
over
the
summer
which
costs
3
,
492
.
It
may
seem
like
OPT
is
the
better
choice
but
OPT
takes
away
from
time
that
you
can
work
in
the
United
States
after
graduation
.
And
,
if
you’d
picked
OPT
this
summer
,
chances
are
you
that
you
would’ve
gotten
screwed
over
by
the
United
States
Citizenship
and
Immigration
Services
USCIS
.
Although
you’re
only
allowed
to
apply
for
OPT
90
days
before
the
end
of
the
school
year
,
the
average
processing
time
this
year
was
100
120
days
.
The
massive
delays
this
summer
meant
that
almost
40
international
students
were
at
risk
of
losing
their
internships
.
Then
there’s
the
simple
things
that
I
take
for
granted
.
If
I
want
,
I
can
drive
home
for
dinner
tonight
.
Others
have
to
sit
through
a
20
hour
long
plane
ride
to
see
their
parents
.
Even
having
a
place
to
go
back
too
isn’t
always
guaranteed
one
of
my
closest
friends
,
who
fled
to
boarding
school
in
India
during
the
Arab
Spring
,
confessed
to
me
that
there’s
no
place
for
him
that
equates
to
home
.
Another
friend
lives
in
Chennai
,
where
a
drought
has
left
millions
of
people
suffering
.
I
can
read
about
as
many
geopolitical
conflicts
as
I
want
,
but
I
will
never
know
what
it’s
like
to
grow
up
in
one
.
Given
that
about
11
percent
of
the
undergraduate
student
population
is
comprised
of
international
students
,
you’d
think
that
Duke
would
spend
enormous
amounts
of
resources
to
make
sure
they’re
supported
.
Yet
,
the
International
House
IHouse
remains
on
Central
Campus
while
everything
around
it
is
being
demolished
.
And
instead
of
writing
to
the
government
during
the
work
authorization
delays
this
summer
,
the
reason
that
students
lose
their
internships
was
because
they
were
forced
to
band
together
and
petition
administration
for
changes
.
Each
conversation
and
story
has
made
me
appreciate
the
boredom
of
North
Carolina
much
more
.
I’m
acutely
aware
that
I
can
see
my
family
whenever
I
want
,
and
that
I’ve
never
had
to
worry
about
being
kicked
out
of
the
country
.
Above
all
,
I’m
thankful
for
my
friends
for
sharing
their
stories
and
giving
me
a
glimpse
of
what
it
means
to
be
international
.
Facebook
may
lead
you
to
believe
that
all
international
students
are
stupidly
rich
,
but
the
cost
of
being
international
is
much
higher
than
you’d
think
.
When
my
mom
had
a
minor
heart
attack
this
summer
while
we
were
at
the
beach
,
I
sat
in
the
waiting
room
with
sand
between
my
toes
,
praying
that
she
would
be
okay
.
She
laid
a
few
yards
away
,
praying
that
she
would
be
believed
.
At
the
heart
of
many
women’s
stories
,
like
the
story
of
my
mom
,
is
a
fear
that
they
will
not
be
believed
by
the
very
people
with
the
power
to
heal
them
.
Stereotypes
about
women’s
lack
of
credibility
and
inherent
emotionality
make
doctors
more
likely
to
ignore
or
undertreat
women’s
pain
not
just
anecdotally
,
but
systematically
.
Women’s
pain
is
consistently
taken
less
seriously
,
with
women
waiting
longer
to
receive
treatment
for
the
same
level
of
pain
,
and
far
more
often
receiving
sedatives
for
the
same
pain
that
,
for
men
,
is
treated
with
painkillers
.
For
example
,
my
mom
waited
seven
hours
before
receiving
pain
medicine
in
the
E
.
R
.
She
was
too
afraid
to
ask
for
pain
medicine
earlier
for
fear
of
being
accused
of
fabricating
her
symptoms
in
search
of
painkillers
.
Studies
of
chronic
pain
conditions
are
overwhelmingly
conducted
on
male
subjects
,
even
though
70
of
chronic
illness
sufferers
are
women
.
This
medicalized
sexism
has
especially
disastrous
effects
for
women
of
color
.
A
landmark
2016
study
showed
that
students
,
the
people
who
will
one
day
be
physicians
to
black
people
in
pain
.
When
medical
racism
interacts
with
medical
sexism
,
the
results
are
deadly
black
women
die
in
childbirth
three
to
four
times
more
often
than
white
women
do
.
Serena
Williams
’s
harrowing
ordeal
with
the
birth
of
her
child
in
2017
brought
the
issue
to
national
attention
and
very
nearly
cost
her
her
life
.
Women
,
especially
women
of
color
,
develop
varied
strategies
to
combat
the
assumptions
people
make
about
women’s
lack
of
credibility
in
reporting
the
experiences
of
their
own
bodies
.
Comedian
Wanda
Sykes
recently
appeared
on
John
Oliver’s
to
discuss
her
strategy
for
combating
medical
racism
and
sexism
bring
a
white
man
to
the
doctor
to
repeat
everything
you
say
.
Hirsch
also
references
a
study
aptly
titled
I
am
not
the
kind
of
woman
who
complains
of
everything
,
saying
some
women
.
.
.
practice
a
version
of
self
policing
in
which
they
try
to
avoid
becoming
the
stereotypical
female
.
’
When
trying
to
get
a
doctor
to
understand
how
much
pain
they’re
in
,
women
have
to
make
careful
calculations
concerning
how
they
present
themselves
.
Too
emotional
,
and
a
woman
risks
being
seen
as
irrational
,
hysterical
,
or
dramatic
,
and
written
off
entirely
.
Too
composed
,
and
the
doctor
may
assume
the
pain
is
not
as
bad
as
the
patient
says
it
is
.
I
learned
these
strategies
young
.
Talking
about
my
back
brace
would
invariably
make
me
cry
,
but
when
I
was
in
the
doctor’s
office
,
I
would
hold
my
feelings
in
until
my
throat
ached
,
not
letting
the
tears
fall
until
I
had
made
it
to
my
mom’s
minivan
with
my
lollipop
in
my
hand
.
I
knew
,
even
at
ten
years
old
,
that
I
had
to
be
seen
as
reasonable
to
be
believed
.
But
I
also
almost
always
left
appointments
feeling
like
the
doctor
and
his
team
didn’t
understand
how
much
I
hurt
.
Anxiety
about
seeing
a
doctor
for
my
pain
kept
me
from
finding
a
pain
specialist
when
I
got
to
Durham
.
I
was
at
a
place
,
medically
and
geographically
,
where
my
orthopedist
from
home
could
no
longer
help
me
.
But
the
possibility
of
not
being
believed
or
understood
terrified
me
,
even
as
I
knew
that
my
whiteness
,
my
status
as
a
Duke
student
,
and
my
insurance
coverage
mean
that
I’m
more
likely
to
be
believed
than
the
majority
of
women
.
I
was
able
to
live
with
pain
without
seeing
a
doctor
for
a
year
and
a
half
before
I
slipped
on
some
ice
and
spent
the
next
two
weeks
with
pain
so
severe
that
it
hurt
to
breathe
.
Desperate
for
relief
and
worried
that
something
major
was
wrong
,
I
walked
into
Student
Health
.
I
soon
found
myself
doing
exactly
what
I
feared
doing
sobbing
uncontrollably
,
unable
to
perform
the
role
of
Reasonable
and
Believable
Girl
In
Pain
that
I
had
rehearsed
for
half
of
my
life
.
But
the
doctor
said
something
that
still
makes
me
tear
up
every
time
I
think
about
it
.
Signup

our
editorially
curated

weekly

Cancel

any
time
.
I
believe
you
.
Her
belief
led
me
to
see
a
pain
specialist
a
doctor
who
did
not
take
my
pain
as
seriously
as
I
had
hoped
.
But
a
year
later
,
it
led
me
back
to
that
same
clinic
,
with
the
hope
that
I
could
find
another
person
who
believed
me
.
It
gave
me
enough
courage
to
tell
the
scheduler
on
the
phone
that
I
needed
to
see
a
female
doctor
.
It
led
me
to
a
doctor
whom
I
am
growing
to
trust
,
and
who
has
been
more
honest
and
empathetic
than
I
could
have
imagined
a
doctor
to
be
.
When
I
told
my
best
friend
about
how
it
felt
to
read
to
see
my
own
anxiety
,
fear
,
and
shame
reflected
in
the
experiences
of
so
many
other
young
women
,
she
said
,
I’m
so
glad
that
somebody
else
wrote
this
book
so
that
you
didn’t
have
to
.
I
am
,
too
.
It
is
validating
to
know
that
not
only
is
my
pain
itself
real
and
valid
,
but
that
the
pain
I
have
experienced
in
the
medical
system
is
also
real
and
valid
.
But
I
also
want
more
for
women
all
women
,
certainly
,
but
for
women
at
the
intersection
of
anti
blackness
,
homophobia
,
transphobia
,
classism
and
xenophobia
in
particular
.
I
want
my
future
daughters
,
nieces
,
goddaughters
and
granddaughters
never
to
hurt
,
but
beyond
that
,
I
want
them
to
be
believed
when
they
do
hurt
no
matter
their
race
,
gender
identity
,
class
,
sexual
orientation
,
or
how
they
present
their
pain
to
their
doctors
.
I
want
that
for
my
mother
and
the
other
women
in
my
life
now
.
And
I
want
that
for
me
.
Dear
Felicia
,
As
an
international
student
at
Duke
,
I
appreciate
your
initiative
to
join
the
International
Association
and
connect
with
those
who
share
different
life
experiences
from
you
.
Although
Duke
is
still
within
your
30
mile
radius
around
Cary
,
North
Carolina
,
it
is
indeed
an
excellent
place
to
explore
different
perspectives
.
Here
,
everyone
has
a
chance
to
build
relationships
with
fellow
students
from
diverse
backgrounds
,
and
engage
together
in
reflections
about
culture
and
identity
.
This
is
a
remarkable
learning
experience
with
lots
to
be
gained
,
but
only
if
approached
with
the
right
attitude
.
Unfortunately
,
Felicia
,
your
article
came
with
deeply
problematic
underpinnings
and
gross
misrepresentations
of
international
students
.
You
criticized
the
fact
that
Facebook
leads
people
to
believe
that
all
international
students
are
stupidly
rich
.
Your
article
,
on
the
other
hand
,
portrays
all
international
students
as
people
who
are
fleeing
from
tragedy
stricken
territories
,
desperately
vying
for
an
opportunity
to
reconstruct
our
pitifully
broken
lives
in
the
United
States
of
America
,
a
wondrous
land
of
opportunity
and
freedom
.
Both
are
miserably
wrong
.
Citing
a
few
examples
of
political
conflict
and
natural
disaster
,
you
articulated
your
sympathy
for
international
students
and
the
difficulties
some
of
us
go
through
.
I
do
not
doubt
that
those
stories
are
worth
mentioning
they
are
valid
struggles
and
genuine
lived
experiences
of
our
peers
.
I
do
,
however
,
question
your
selection
of
those
particular
stories
to
share
.
Was
it
because
you
believed
those
were
common
experiences
amongst
international
students
,
or
because
those
were
easy
sensational
stories
that
align
with
your
underlying
view
that
international
students
are
escaping
persecution
of
some
sort
to
seek
hope
in
your
country
?
A
language
of
pathos
and
passivity
runs
throughout
your
article
.
International
students
are
forced
to
pay
for
CPT
writing
classes
,
screwed
over
by
the
United
States
Citizenship
and
Immigration
Services
USCIS
,
forced
to
band
together
to
petition
,
and
risk
being
kicked
out
of
the
country
.
When
you
could
have
described
the
challenges
international
students
face
in
many
different
ways
,
you
chose
a
tone
of
victimisation
.
But
we
are
not
victims
,
we
are
not
merely
passive
recipients
of
your
country’s
actions
.
The
opportunity
to
pursue
education
at
an
intellectually
rigorous
environment
like
Duke
is
not
an
act
of
mercy
extended
to
pairs
of
begging
hands
.
We
all
worked
hard
to
be
here
,
and
decided
to
come
here
out
of
our
own
volition
,
fully
aware
that
there
will
be
hurdles
to
overcome
.
In
the
face
of
obstacles
such
as
OPT
delays
or
visa
complications
,
if
you
can
offer
only
pity
,
then
please
respectfully
stay
in
your
lane
.
Before
you
feel
proud
about
your
attempt
to
speak
up
for
international
students
,
please
recognize
your
own
biases
.
Friendships
with
international
students
should
not
serve
as
a
platform
for
domestic
students
to
claim
their
privileges
,
as
it
risks
implying
that
international
students
are
less
privileged
.
The
United
States
is
not
the
best
country
in
the
world
.
Just
as
some
of
us
grew
up
amidst
geopolitical
conflict
which
you
can
only
read
about
,
some
of
us
grew
up
reading
about
school
shootings
and
terrorist
attacks
that
may
very
well
have
had
a
close
impact
on
your
life
.
Some
of
us
are
excited
about
building
our
future
careers
in
the
United
States
,
others
might
rather
live
elsewhere
.
Some
of
us
miss
home
dearly
,
others
enjoy
the
independence
of
being
several
long
haul
flights
away
from
home
.
nbsp
;
And
these
are
not
binaries
many
of
us
are
somewhere
in
between
.
Felicia
,
there
are
both
pros
and
cons
,
and
a
wide
array
of
subjective
experiences
for
anyone
living
anywhere
.
I
am
glad
you
have
grown
to
appreciate
the
boredom
of
North
Carolina
,
but
to
me
,
an
international
student
,
your
article
is
just
at
best
an
egocentric
proclamation
of
how
much
perspective
you
think
you
have
,
and
at
worst
an
embarrassing
revelation
of
how
much
perspective
you
do
not
have
.
Last
month
,
when
I
decided
that
I
wanted
to
learn
about
the
upcoming
presidential
election
,
I
did
what
I
thought
my
politically
conscious
friends
would
tell
me
to
do
re
download
Twitter
,
unfollow
Kim
Kardashian
and
find
a
few
senators
,
a
few
journalists
,
a
few
left
wing
news
publications
and
all
twenty
something
candidates
that
were
running
at
the
time
.
For
good
measure
,
I
followed
Trump
and
Fox
News
.
In
about
20
minutes
,
I
compiled
a
stream
of
tweets
that
seemed
educational
at
first
but
quickly
turned
into
a
firehose
of
opinions
.
So
I
stopped
checking
Twitter
for
a
few
days
.
Sophomore
year
,
one
of
my
best
friends
told
me
that
despite
our
best
friendship
,
she
could
never
fully
respect
me
because
I
was
someone
who
doesn’t
care
that
much
about
politics
.
I
was
stamped
as
apolitical
,
and
it
became
a
part
of
my
brand
.
We’re
seniors
now
,
but
not
much
has
changed
.
She
attends
protests
,
writes
letters
to
inmates
,
was
one
of
the
students
from
People’s
State
who
in
2018
.
I
feel
weird
walking
down
the
street
holding
signs
.
I
travelled
to
Washington
,
D
.
C
.
for
the
Women’s
March
after
Trump’s
election
in
2017
because
it
felt
like
something
I’d
remember
.
I
couldn’t
get
out
of
my
own
head
enough
to
chant
slogans
.
I
remember
men
peddling
pink
beanies
along
the
trail
,
and
walking
with
a
crowd
of
mostly
white
women
who’d
reached
their
10
,
000
steps
that
day
and
stood
in
line
for
their
Starbucks
after
the
march
.
There
were
a
lot
of
cute
Instagram
posts
later
,
as
if
it
were
a
good
day
to
protest
.
I
almost
went
to
San
Francisco
Pride
this
summer
but
decided
against
it
because
I
didn’t
want
to
inadvertently
get
roasted
as
a
.
I
went
surfing
instead
.
Perfectly
benign
,
a
good
feeling
Instagram
moment
rather
than
a
hot
take
Twitter
moment
.
Waves
pummeled
against
me
as
I
paddled
into
the
ocean
.
I
was
phoneless
and
had
no
idea
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
.
In
the
case
that
I
missed
breaking
news
and
everything
was
about
to
go
up
in
flames
,
I’d
be
floating
in
the
water
.
I
was
probably
trying
to
escape
to
the
safety
of
my
a
politics
.
I’m
a
beach
girl
,
an
art
girl
,
outdoorsy
,
someone
who
knows
more
about
celebrity
scandal
than
the
upcoming
election
,
a
free
spirit
,
generally
optimistic
.
Keeping
up
with
the
news
or
scrolling
through
Twitter
feels
like
work
when
I’d
rather
read
fiction
in
the
.
I’ve
been
wondering
what
it
means
to
think
of
myself
as
apolitical
.
The
popular
answer
is
that
I’m
privileged
enough
to
not
care
,
or
I’m
one
of
those
nbsp
;
who
won’t
take
a
side
.
I
don’t
want
to
be
either
of
those
things
,
but
I’m
having
trouble
figuring
out
what
it
means
to
be
political
.
I’m
in
awe
of
my
friends
who
declare
their
opinions
on
the
latest
news
cycle
with
an
urgency
that
I
seem
to
be
missing
.
It
feels
like
everyone
already
has
their
opinions
,
and
to
admit
to
being
unsure
is
to
be
apathetic
towards
all
the
suffering
and
pain
in
the
world
.
Information
overload
is
unavoidable
if
you
get
your
news
through
social
media
like
I
do
,
and
filtering
out
what’s
real
and
what’s
not
is
disorienting
.
I’ve
tried
to
be
more
attentive
lately
.
I
decided
I’d
start
with
the
election
.
I
scroll
through
Twitter
semi
regularly
,
read
articles
about
the
democratic
candidates
,
watch
clips
of
late
night
television
on
YouTube
.
I
see
the
left
destroy
Trump
on
Twitter
like
some
WorldStar
fever
dream
,
and
I
know
that
Beto
O’Rourke
can
change

dad
I
suppose
displaying
these
normal
people
activities
are
likable
qualities
for
a
future
president
,
but
they
seem
like
frivolous
diversions
from
the
serious
news
in
my
feed
.
Pop
culture
and
politics
are
incestuously
close
.
Kim
Kardashian
tweets
,
and
so
does
Joe
Biden
.
Trump
used
to
be
just
another
celebrity
.
What
I’m
seeing
online
is
edgy
reality
television
where
I
can
and
watch
people
bully
each
other
on
the
internet
in
the
name
of
a
moral
high
ground
.
Being
a
good
consumer
of
politics
at
the
very
least
requires
sharp
attention
,
an
ability
to
tell
what’s
viral
entertainment
and
what’s
reliably
reported
news
.
The
differences
aren’t
so
clear
sometimes
.
One
source
I’ve
found
that
filters
my
chaotic
feed
is
a
daily
newsletter
written
by
a
very
precocious
high
schooler
in
Missouri
.
It’s
a
no
b
.
s
.
rundown
of
the
day’s
politics
and
serves
as
a
friendly
starting
point
for
people
learning
about
politics
.
I
feel
good
knowing
that
it’s
in
my
inbox
when
I
wake
up
in
the
morning
.
But
the
work
of
reading
it
and
then
clicking
on
the
hyperlinks
to
read
more
feels
tedious
.
I
try
to
do
it
anyway
since
it
seems
important
and
good
for
me
,
but
it’s
not
always
exciting
in
the
way
that
attending
a
protest
might
be
exciting
.
Staying
politically
informed
is
largely
invisible
work
.
Caring
about
politics
isn’t
something
that
has
to
be
validated
through
social
media
or
shouted
out
on
the
streets
.
It
starts
with
spending
time
on
the
news
,
being
patient
enough
to
find
reliable
sources
,
feeling
motivated
to
do
it
all
again
the
next
day
.
I’d
like
to
stop
internalizing
the
idea
of
being
apolitical
,
for
my
own
sake
.
I
care
.
I
can’t
give
myself
the
instant
gratification
of
knowing
where
I
stand
,
or
who
I
stand
with
.
Sometimes
I’d
rather
watch
a
movie
than
read
the
news
,
and
I
feel
guilty
even
though
caring
about
politics
shouldn’t
have
to
consume
me
in
order
for
it
to
be
true
.
I
can’t
promise
consistency
of
thought
,
and
that
seems
okay
as
a
21
year
old
who’s
confused
about
most
things
in
life
.
But
still
,
it
must
be
frustrating
for
those
who’ve
already
formed
their
opinions
.
Before
I
surf
,
I
tell
myself
that
the
water’s
only
a
little
bit
cold
.
Don’t
be
scared
.
In
2017
,
the
MeToo
Movement
went
viral
.
Thousands
of
women
shared
their
experiences
of
sexual
assault
and
harassment
,
bringing
global
awareness
to
a
topic
that
affected
millions
of
women
across
the
world
.
As
many
political
movements
do
,
however
,
it
sparked
considerable
controversy
.
Many
people
fired
back
,
saying
that
women
were
being
too
sensitive
and
exaggerating
or
even
fabricating
their
claims
.
Many
men
felt
that
they
were
being
over
scrutinized
and
that
they
could
no
longer
feel
comfortable
interacting
with
women
.
The
NotAllMen
campaign
started
in
response
,
in
an
effort
to
assert
that
only
a
minority
of
men
are
involved
with
sexual
assault
or
harrassment
.
The
arc
of
the
MeToo
Movement
is
a
classic
example
of
an
awareness
movement
that
was
perceived
as
an
attack
and
consequently
provoked
defensiveness
.
Instead
of
acknowledging
our
biases
,
it
is
often
easier
to
defend
our
actions
.
As
such
,
even
if
we
can
recognize
problematic
actions
in
theory
,
it’s
harder
to
recognize
them
in
ourselves
.
So
how
can
we
let
go
of
our
natural
defensiveness
?
When
I
am
criticized
,
whether
in
a
peer
writing
session
or
in
a
conversation
with
friends
,
I
know
that
I
tend
to
justify
my
actions
rather
than
admit
wrongdoing
.
This
is
a
natural
knee
jerk
reaction
,
but
it
shouldn’t
be
the
end
.
In
writing
,
for
example
,
the
constructive
criticism
I
receive
allows
me
to
improve
on
a
piece
.
I
have
that
the
same
is
true
for
my
interactions
getting
called
out
allows
me
to
improve
my
future
behavior
.
As
humans
,
it’s
in
our
nature
to
believe
that
our
actions
align
with
our
ideals
.
But
as
humans
,
we
do
make
mistakes
.
Consequently
,
when
confronted
,
our
first
instinct
is
often
to
defend
.
Instead
,
we
should
truly
listen
to
the
other
person
and
reflect
on
our
own
actions
.
Duke
is
a
generally
liberal
environment
.
However
,
because
many
of
us
see
ourselves
as
woke
to
social
issues
and
may
even
represent
different
marginalized
groups
,
it
can
be
hard
to
admit
that
we
may
also
be
perpetuating
problematic
behaviors
that
we
see
in
distant
acquaintances
,
on
Twitter
,
or
in
the
news
.
If
someone
points
out
an
action
that
they
found
insensitive
,
then
,
we
may
jump
to
the
idea
that
they
are
overexaggerating
.
For
example
,
if
a
friend
said
that
they
were
hurt
by
a
joke
,
our
initial
thought
might
be
that
they
are
being
oversensitive
.
If
no
one
had
the
intention
of
saying
something
offensive
and
they
are
generally
socially
aware
,
then
it
can
be
hard
to
see
where
the
offense
is
coming
from
.
Just
because
we
try
to
be
cognizant
of
our
internalized
biases
doesn’t
mean
we
always
succeed
.
However
,
by
blaming
the
others
and
defending
ourselves
,
we
risk
jeopardizing
relationships
and
coming
off
as
even
more
insensitive
.
It
is
also
important
to
remember
that
it
is
not
the
responsibility
of
someone
from
a
marginalized
group
to
educate
others
.
They
should
not
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
explaining
their
experience
.
If
they
do
choose
to
explain
,
then
others
should
listen
to
and
trust
what
they
say
and
how
they
feel
.
It
should
never
be
framed
as
a
privilege
for
them
to
be
heard
,
nor
should
anyone
try
to
judge
whether
their
experience
is
valid
or
relevant
.
We
should
be
motivated
by
respect
.
Because
they
are
the
ones
who
have
lived
the
experience
,
it
is
best
to
defer
to
their
judgement
.
Their
explanation
is
most
likely
intended
to
inspire
reflection
.
Because
the
other
person
is
important
to
them
,
they
have
chosen
to
face
their
anxiety
to
explain
why
they
are
hurt
or
offended
,
not
because
they
want
to
criticize
.
Everyone
has
unconscious
and
internalized
biases
.
Those
thoughts
and
biases
don't
correlate
to
being
a
bad
person
,
but
they
do
reflect
larger
structures
of
racism
,
sexism
,
and
homophobia
that
are
hard
to
recognize
internally
.
Being
able
to
reflect
and
apologize
for
our
wrongdoings
makes
us
more
open
minded
and
helps
us
to
improve
as
people
and
as
friends
.
By
following
these
ideals
,
we
can
combat
the
systems
that
produced
these
biases
in
the
first
place
.
Picture
this
it’s
10
p
.
m
.
on
a
Thursday
night
and
I’m
prying
little
bits
of
skin
from
a
peach
with
my
fingers
.
The
weirdly
lit
,
subterranean
Wannamaker
kitchen
is
filling
up
with
steam
,
soft
French
jazz
,
and
the
sweet
smell
of
ripe
summer
fruit
.
James
,
Taylor
and
I
are
making
peach
hand
pies
.
We’re
invading
the
kitchen
of
a
dorm
we
don’t
live
in
for
this
purpose
,
shuffling
together
mismatched
ingredients
we
bought
mostly
at
the
Lobby
Shop
.
But
I’ve
been
looking
forward
to
this
all
week
,
and
as
the
stubborn
peel
lifts
at
last
from
the
blanched
peach
,
I
feel
my
shoulders
unclenching
.
For
the
past
couple
weeks
,
I’ve
been
preaching
the
good
news
of
peach
hand
pies
.
These
pockets
of
seasonal
sunshine
can
be
made
en
masse
and
mostly
on
a
dime
.
My
pastry
enthusiasm
might
seem
misplaced
and
I
thank
you
,
my
friends
,
for
feigning
excitement
about
my
latest
baking
endeavor
,
but
these
little
pies
mean
a
lot
more
than
fresh
from
the
oven
sugar
.
They’re
a
mile
marker
of
my
progress
in
a
new
philosophy
.
Or
rather
,
a
newly
adopted
one
time
tested
and
handed
down
generations
of
women
on
my
mother's
side
of
the
family
.
The
philosophy
is
simple
always
have
something
to
look
forward
to
.
The
idea
is
that
mindfulness
engenders
gratitude
,
and
that
anticipation
supersedes
anxiety
.
But
we
don’t
need
big
words
to
understand
that
when
you
know
you’re
going
to
Disneyland
on
Saturday
,
it’s
easier
to
study
for
the
test
on
Friday
.
This
is
textbook
.
Looking
forward
may
be
easy
enough
at
Duke
the
Disneyland
of
academic
and
recreational
opportunity
.
But
for
a
practice
we
can
sustain
,
say
,
throughout
a
lifetime
,
we
must
find
ways
to
create
these
merry
making
moments
for
ourselves
.
And
it
doesn’t
take
much
,
aside
from
planning
in
advance
.
This
past
Thursday
,
it
took
little
more
than
sugar
,
butter
,
ripe
peaches
,
and
the
wrong
kind
of
flour
.
.
.
The
pies
,
when
they
emerge
from
the
oven
,
are
sticky
,
haphazard
,
a
little
bit
too
puffy
the
Lobby
Shop
only
sells
self
rising
flour
with
baking
powder
,
which
definitely
does
NOT
go
in
pie
crust
,
built
in
.
We’re
proud
of
them
anyway
,
because
they’re
ours
,
and
because
we’ve
shared
something
tactile
and
intimate
which
will
remain
even
once
the
filling’s
mesmerizing
syrup
scent
fades
from
the
air
.
Our
project
this
semester
is
to
make
more
memories
like
these
.
Taylor
and
I
will
be
inviting
professors
,
staff
,
and
students
anyone
with
a
great
story
to
tell
to
come
talk
,
shove
some
dough
around
,
and
find
peace
with
us
.
This
week
,
our
guest
is
my
friend
James
,
a
magnetic
,
gap
toothed
Kenyan
boy
with
energy
always
running
through
his
body
.
But
gracefulness
doesn’t
imply
technical
skill
he
begged
us
for
a
baking
tutorial
after
scorching
a
batch
of
chocolate
chip
cookies
.
We
embraced
James’
task
gladly
.
Because
the
caffeine
wired
conversation
which
bore
the
Bread
Talks
brainchild
into
existence
several
months
ago
was
all
about
this
sharing
the
joy
and
meaning
we’d
found
in
baking
with
others
.
Bread
Talks
is
also
very
much
an
excuse
to
bake
you
caught
us
.
But
above
all
,
we
hope
this
column
delivers
a
little
Mary
Berry
magic
,
a
little
Ratatouille
wisdom
into
your

Before
you
ask
no
,
we
don’t
have
the
culinary
acumen
to
work
for
Bon
Appetit
.
Yes
,
it
angers
us
.
Anyway
,
here’s
the
rundown
of
how
this
recipe
from
Food
amp
;
Wine
turned
out
for
us
three
highly
average
bakers
.
James
was
trying
to
do
thin
slices
here
and
I
had
to
intervene
.
Round
peach
slices
will
not
fit
in
your
pies
!
You
better
hope
your
clothing
will
go
home
smelling
like
step
two
.
Do
not
eat
the
dough
.
It
is
not
yummy
.
I
know
you
will
anyway
but
I’m
telling
you
do
not
.
You’re
supposed
to
do
this
in
the
fridge
,
but
we
used
the
freezer
.
I
simply
don’t
understand
why
you
would
cause
yourself
suffering
by
waiting
for
these
hand
pies
a
minute
longer
than
you
have
to
live
fast
,
bake
soon
freezer
girls
do
it
best
.
Oh
god
a
lot
can
go
wrong
here
.
You
need
less
peach
than
you
think
.
Over
eager
pie
fillers
will
wear
the
evidence
on
their
hands
.
It’s
also
helpful
to
pinch
around
the
edges
with
your
fingers
to
make
the
dough
more
malleable
pre
crimping
.
You
gotta
eat
the
leftover
peach
syrup
.
If
you
had
fun
baking
with
us
or
laughing
at
us
,
good
news
it’s
just
the
beginning
.
Tune
in
every
other
week
for
new
adventures
in
patisserie
and
living
well
.
Let’s
get
this
bread
.
Last
Monday
,
Palantir
Technologies
a
company
with
a
multi
million
dollar
contract
with
ICE
hosted
an
ethics
tabletop
exercise
at
Duke
asking
participants
to
wrestle
with
ethical
dilemmas
such
as
,
Can
you
save
the
lives
of
10
,
000
people
without
jeopardizing
the
freedoms
of
100
,
000
?
Palantir
also
participated
the
next
day
at
TechConnect
,
seeking
to
network
with
Duke
computer
science
and
engineering
students
.
Palantir
is
a
data
analytics
company
that
provides
ICE
with
technology
that
is
used
in
the
surveillance
,
tracking
and
ultimately
deportation
of
immigrants
.
ICE
uses
Palantir’s
Integrated
Case
Management
ICM
to
scour
local
,
regional
,
state
and
federal
databases
for
utilities
data
,
healthcare
provider
information
,
live
cellphone
records
and
other
information
that
is
used
to
build
profiles
on
immigrants
and
undocumented
individuals
.
Unaccompanied
minors
apprehended
at
the
border
are
logged
into
the
ICM
system
,
discouraging
family
members
from
claiming
their
children
out
of
fear
of
background
checks
.
The
end
result
is
these
children
remain
detained
for
longer
periods
of
time
.
It
doesn’t
stop
there
.
Palantir
also
built
the
FALCON
Search
and
Analysis
FALCON
SA
system
that
ICE
uses
as
part
of
immigration
workplace
raids
,
including
raids
last
year
that
targeted
almost
one
hundred
7
Elevens
one
of
the
largest
ICE
raids
at
the
time
.
ICE
also
uses
FALCON
SA
to
identify
and
visualize
an
individual’s
web
of
connections
and
relationships
,
enabling
the
government
to
expand
its
surveillance
dragnet
.
Given
Palantir’s
reprehensible
track
record
,
a
number
of
Duke
students
protested
and
distributed
flyers
about
Palantir’s
connections
to
ICE
at
both
events
last
week
.
Students
refused
to
stand
idly
by
as
Palantir
shamelessly
treated
ethics
as
a
mere
hypothetical
game
while
ICE
simultaneously
uses
its
technology
to
jeopardize
the
freedoms
of
thousands
of
actual
people
.
Students
rejected
complicity
with
ICE’s
detention
and
deportation
machine
by
pledging
in
a
petition
to
withhold
their
labor
from
Palantir
and
other
companies
that
constitute
the
agency’s
technological
and
logistical
backbone
.
Notably
,
although
some
of
the
Palantir
representatives
present
claimed
to
find
ICE’s
enforcement
work
reprehensible
,
they
had
no
qualms
with
calling
Duke
police
on
demonstrating
students
twice
.
By
allowing
Palantir
to
run

companies
that
are
complicit
in
the
surveillance
,
detention
and
deportation
of
immigrants
and
undocumented
communities
at
the
hands
of
ICE
.
The
claim
that
Duke
values
its
students
no
matter
their
background
or
immigration
status
sounds
hollow
in
the
context
of
the
institution’s
failure
to
prioritize
the
safety
of
its
undocumented
and
immigrant
students
.
However
,
the
Pratt
School
of
Engineering
,
Department
of
Computer
Science
,
Career
Center
and
Duke
University
at
large
still
have
the
ability
to
terminate
their
relationship
with
Palantir
as
long
as
it
continues
to
maintain
its
contract
with
ICE
.
Over
2
,
000
students
from
at
least
17
colleges
and
counting
have
been
demonstrating
at
Palantir
information
sessions
and
their
schools’
career
fairs
,
demanding
that
their
institutions
cease
their
ties
with
Palantir
.
UC
Berkeley’s
Privacy
Law
Scholars
Conference
decided
not
to
seek
financial
support
from
the
company
.

Tech
returned
the
15
,
000
dollars
it
received
from
Palantir’s
sponsorship
of
its
conference
.
And
the
Grace
Hopper
Celebration
,
the
world’s
largest
gathering
of
women
in
technology
which
Duke
University
sponsors
and
numerous
Duke
students
attend
every
year
dropped
Palantir
as
a
sponsor
.
Rallying
under
the
calls
for
NoTech4ICE
and
to
AbolishICE
,
organizations
across
the
country
such
as
Mijente
,
Coalition
to
Close
the
Concentration
Camps
,
Jews
for
Racial
amp
;
Economic
Justice
and
Never
Again
Action
have
also
demonstrated
against
Palantir
and
other
complicit
companies
like
Amazon
for
their
role
in
facilitating
the
separation
of
families
,
detention
of
immigrants
and
deportation
of
people
.
Duke
would
be
in
good
company
if
it
ceases
its
relationship
with
Palantir
and
chooses
to
live
up
to
its
purported
mission
statement
of
developing
ethical
leadership
in
its
students
and
helping
those
who
suffer
.
But
beyond
Duke
University
itself
,
Duke
students
need
to
muster
the
moral
backbone
to
take
a
stand
against
not
just
Palantir
but
also
Amazon
,
Microsoft
,
Dell
,
McKinsey
amp
;
Co
,
Wayfair
and
numerous
other
companies
that
have
contracts
with
ICE
and
are
therefore
complicit
in
enabling
white
supremacy
and
white
nationalism
.
I
sympathize
deeply
with
students
anxious
about
survival
under
capitalism
and
finding
work
that
helps
them
secure
financial
stability
,
pay
off
their
loans
and
support
their
families
.
But
my
sympathy
ends
when
students
prioritize
profits
and
personal
gain
but
Palantir
pays
43
an
hour
!
over
humanity
and
compassion
for
others
.
In
any
case
,
if
we
want
to
take
an
ethical
stand
in
a
profoundly
unethical
world
,
we
must
be
prepared
to
make
real
,
material
sacrifices
.
Last
week
,
Palantir
and
its
defenders
some
of
them
my
fellow
peers
argued
that
we
are
emotionally
misguided
and
that
these
issues
require
more
nuance
.
If
logic
and
reason
are
used
to
justify
the
concentration
camps
at
the
border
,
the
deaths
of
children
,
and
the
tearing
apart
of
families
,
what
value
do
they
have
?

If
nuance
means
Palantir
will
claim
that
its
ICE
contracts
don’t
negate
their
good
work
with
the
Department
of
Justice
,
FBI
,
and
US
military
,
what
meaningful
resistance
does
it
pose
to
the
oppression
of
immigrants
and
undocumented
communities
?
If
emotion
and
outrage
give
people
the
strength
to
demand
the
abolition
of
ICE
,
to
physically
block
ICE
vans
,
to
link
their
arms
together
to
block
ICE
headquarters
,
to
put
their
very
bodies
upon
the
gears
to
stop
ICE’s
odious
machine
,
then
I
know
we
are
the
ones
bending
the
long
moral
arc
of
the
universe
towards
justice
.
I
close
with
an
ethical
dilemma
of
my
own
for
Duke
University
and
my
fellow
students
.
The
concentration
camps
at
US
Mexico
border
have
been
compared
to
Nazi
concentration
camps
.
Many
people
ask
themselves
what
they
would
have
done
during
the
Holocaust
.
Today
,
we
live
in
a
time
of
rising
fascism
in
America
.
In
Nazi
Germany
,
there
was
IBM
.
In
America
,
there
is
Palantir
.
So
,
in
the
face
of
oppression
and
injustice
right
here
and
right
now
,
what
you
will
do
?
In
pursuit
of
a
more
equitable
future
,
Duke
University
has
recently
acknowledged
past
missteps
and
taken
actions
to
remedy
them
.
The
campus’s
current
ideology
is
reflected
in
the
recognition
of
the
black
architect
,
Julian
F
Abele
,
who
designed
Duke’s
iconic
gothic
campus
three
decades
before
the
admittance
of
people
of
color
.
At
a
2016
ceremony
,
Abele
was
finally
immortalized
when
the
central
West
campus
quad
was
renamed
in
his
honor
,
in
hopes
that
the
celebration
of
black
excellence
would
propel
African
American
students
forward
with
a
feeling
of
ownership
of
the
place
.
The
ceremony
encapsulated
Duke’s
efforts
to
honor
the
once
ignored
history
and
achievements
of
minorities
within
its
diverse
community
.
From
exhibits
at
the
Nasher
museum
to
student
led
performances
,
such
as
Awaaz
,
and
Jabulani
,
celebrations
of
the
unique
cultures
,
art
,
and
traditions
at
Duke
are
part
of
a
conscious
effort
to
prioritize
and
protect
the
gallimaufry
of
diversity
on
campus
.
While
these
values
are
ubiquitous
throughout
Duke’s
community
,
off
campus
is
a
different
story
.
Being
Durham’s
largest
employer
and
landowner
,
Duke
could
help
integrate
their
philosophy
into
the
surrounding
community
,
whose
unique
culture
is
gravely
endangered
.
A
recent
wave
of
gentrification
has
lead
to
an
astounding
eviction
rate
in
Durham
one
in
twenty
eight
residents
received
eviction
notices
in
2016
,
particularly
in
East
Durham
surrounding
the
historically
black
Hayti
community
.
To
some
degree
,
this
is
driven
by
the
relative
affluence
of
Duke
students
as
the
median
income
for
our
families
is
three
times
higher
than
that
of
Durham
county’s
.
If
students
begin
to
view
Durham
as
more
than
Duke’s
location
,
a
healthy
dialogue
could
arise
regarding
how
we
can
help
the
city
remain
culturally
unique
.
Of
the
3697
courses
on
the
course
request
list
only
six
focus
on
Durham
,
and
it
is
my
belief
that
if
a
class
on
Durham’s
culture
were
mandatory
,
students
would
start
to
view
Durham
,
not
campus
,
as
home
.
Similar
to
Duke
,
my
hometown
still
deals
with
its
complicated
past
.
I
never
observed
overtly
racist
sentiments
from
my
fourth
grade
teacher
and
future
soccer
coach
;
he
valued
all
students
equally
,
and
coached
with
the
same
philosophy
.
However
,
he
used
the
stories
of
confederate
soldiers
John
Pelham
,
a
seventeen
year
old
officer
renowned
for
his
unflinching
bravery
,
and
Richard
Rowland
Kirkland
,
the
angel
of
Marye’s
heights
,
to
energize
us
before
soccer
games
.
They
never
hit
home
and
always
felt
weirdly
out
of
touch
.
While
their
names
were
drilled
into
my
head
,
I
knew
little
of
the
12
,
000
plus
slaves
who
lived
,
died
and
suffered
in
Fredericksburg
and
the
surrounding
countryside
.
I
believe
such
a
skewed
knowledge
of
history
leads
at
best
to
well
intended
yet
ignorant
actions
.
At
its
worst
,
it
exacerbates
underlying
racist
sentiments
,
like
those
of
the
heritage
not
hate
group
who
try
to
legitimatize
the
history
of
the
confederate
states
.
When
discussions
arose
regarding
the
fate
of
a
former
slave
auction
block
marring
the
heart
of
our
town
,
I
,
with
my
egregious
lack
of
historical
knowledge
in
place
,
unquestioningly
supported
its
removal
.
However
,
while
attending
a
city
council
meeting
,
my
opinion
shifted
upon
hearing
the
passionate
argument
of
an
African
American
woman
against
its
removal
.
She
argued
that
it
would
only
further
destroy
memories
of
the
horror
of
slavery
and
continue
to
whitewash
my
town’s
history
.
After
listening
to
her
speak
,
I
realized
I
had
become
part
of
the
problem
regarding
historical
narratives
.
I
made
a
decision
on
a
complex
topic
I
was
not
a
part
of
based
on
skewed
information
and
no
cultural
understanding
.
I
have
since
adopted
a
new
approach
when
seeking
to
understand
my
community’s
stories
.
I
sit
and
listen
.
I
have
no
way
of
understanding
the
background
and
desires
of
others
unless
I
first
internalize
their
words
and
thoughts
.
Being
in
the
majority
,
I
should
act
as
a
mouthpiece
for
others
,
not
overshadow
their
words
with
my
own
opinions
and
judgements
;
it
is
not
my
place
to
decide
what
others
want
and
need
,
only
to
support
them
if
they
ask
for
it
and
celebrate
alongside
them
when
I
can
.
Addressing
Duke
students’
community
engagement
in
Durham
,
I
want
to
start
by
unpacking
the
term
Durhamite
.
Referring
to
someone
as
a
Durhamite
does
not
simply
mean
they
are
from
Durham
.
You
would
never
call
one
of
your
fellow
Duke
students
from
Durham
a
Durhamite
.
Rather
,
it
is
a
pejorative
term
that
packs
connotations
of
being
poor
,
low
class
,
uneducated
,
or
creepy
.
.
.
When
I
go
out
to
bars
at
home
in
Chicago
,
there
are
no
debasing
terms
for
my
existence
,
as
no
one
seems
to
think
my
presence
is
an
invasion
.
Being
a
Duke
student
versus
a
Durhamite
is
not
an
issue
of
where
we
are
from
,
it
is
an
issue
of
class
.
The
term
Durhamite
also
points
to
the
idea
that
we
as
Duke
students
do
not
live
in
Durham
we
are
not
Durhamites
.
There’s
of
a
lot
of
truth
to
this
,
because
although
we
may
geographically
live
in
Durham
,
we
live
our
lives
practically
at
Duke
,
even
if
we
live
in
Berkshire
Main
,
Station
9
,
West
Village
,
or
another
fancy
apartment
complex
.
We
live
in
a
bubble
and
that’s
okay
,
because
privilege
is
not
necessarily
a
bad
thing
.
Nonetheless
,
we
need
to
understand
our
bubble
and
how
it
relates
to
Durham
.
Only
when
we
understand
can
we
even
begin
to
mitigate
the
potential
harm
such
as
gentrification
that
this
bubble
implies
.
To
mitigate
harm
,
we
can
start
with
rethinking
our
language
.
Making
people
feel
alienated
in
their
own
city
by
calling
them
Durhamites
doesn’t
help
.
Beyond
this
bare
minimum
,
I
believe
it’s
important
to
educate
ourselves
on
the
place
we’ll
be
occupying
for
four
years
,
to
understand
its
history
and
our
own
positionality
within
the
space
.
This
process
should
be
anything
but
boring
,
as
the
history
of
Durham
is
immensely
rich
,
from
the
tobacco
industry
,
Black
Wall
Street
,
its
rich
Civil
Rights
Movement
,
a
story
of
its
school
desegregation
in
the
book
and
movie
,
its
musical
history
through
blues
and
jazz
,
and
even
Duke’s
presence
.
Above
all
,
I
believe
the
best
way
to
educate
and
enrich
yourself
is
through
engagement
with
Durham
.
This
should
go
beyond
weekly
trips
to
Monuts
and
the
occasional
night
out
at
Boxcar
.
Engagement
means
existing
in
Durham
beyond
being
a
Duke
student
.
Ironically
,
Duke
can
be
a
great
place
to
start
with
this
,
whether
it
be
through
a
service
learning
course
or
BassConnections
project
,
research
,
or
other
civic
engagement
.
However
,
three
years
as
a
Duke
student
have
taught
me
that
most
of
us
are
not
rich
in
time
and
that
adding
one
more
responsibility
onto
our
plates
can
push
us
off
the
deep
end
.
Luckily
,
engagement
doesn’t
necessarily
need
to
be
a
formal
position
at
a
non
profit
,
volunteering
,
or
having
a
job
.
Engagement
can
be
as
big
or
small
as
anyone
wants
it
to
be
.
During
my
first
year
at
Duke
,
I
was
in
no
way
engaged
with
Durham
,
even
though
I
had
a
desire
to
be
,
because
I
didn’t
know
where
to
start
.
Since
then
,
through
my
own
experiences
and
through
those
of
my
friends
,
I
have
become
aware
of
many
pathways
to
community
engagement
here
.
So
,
I
hope
that
this
list
of
organizations
in
Durham
could
catalyze
others
,
especially
first
years
,
to
begin
nbsp
;
engaging
more
thoughtfully
with
the
city
.

The

I
hope
that
this
list
will
provide
fellow
Duke
students
more
pathways
to
become
engaged
in
Durham
.
As
I’ve
learned
,
Durham’s
network
of
organizations
that
aim
to
empower
the
community
are
tightly
interwoven
,
so
as
you
engage
with
one
,
that
will
likely
lead
to
another
,
and
another
.
Moreover
,
I
believe
one’s
mindset
is
critical
as
a
Duke
student
getting
involved
in
Durham
.
One
should
never
think
they
are
doing
charity
work
when
engaging
in
Durham
.
Rather
,
community
engagement
should
be
viewed
as
enriching
for
both
parties
,
valuable
experiences
for
us
Duke
students
,
and
maybe
some
more
hands
on
deck
and
support
for
organizations
and
people
in
Durham
.
Valued
reader
,
Yes
,
it
is
okay
to
bark
back
.
But
it
depends
on
your
barking
abilities
.
Practice
in
the
shower
to
gauge
if
your
bark
is
louder
than
hers
.
When
going
canine
,
it’s
best
to
be
dominant
.
But
while
a
single
bark
may
be
a
humorous
way
to
defuse
the
situation
,
it
is
not
necessarily
the
best
course
of
action
.
It’s
worth
analyzing
why
she
feels
compelled
to
bark
.
Have
you
checked
for
any
correlation
with
the
lunar
cycle
?
Perhaps
this
is
a
twenty
first
century
expression
of
ennui
.
Sort
of
like
Gregor
Samsa
,
the
stressed
out
salesman
who
awoke
one
day
to
find
himself
transformed
into
an
insect
.
Except
in
this
case
,
the
stress
of
being
a
Duke
student
has
transformed
and
deprived
her
of
the
ability
to
speak
.
But
what
are
the
chances
of
that
?
Slim
to
none
.
There
is
a
reason
that
The
Metamorphosis
is
classified
as
fiction
.
All
kidding
aside
,
maybe
this
bark
is
a
message
.
Not
the
most
eloquent
one
,
but
a
message
nonetheless
.
The
easiest
course
of
action
would
be
to
report
it
to
Housing
and
Residence
Life
HRL
and
ask
them
to
sort
it
out
.
They’ve
been
dealing
with
problems
like
this
for
decades
and
likely
have
seen
similar
cases
in
the
past
.
But
is
their
intervention
necessary
?
Absolutely
not
.
This
is
a
life
lesson
,
one
that
students
are
entirely
capable
of
resolving
on
their
own
.
After
all
,
we
are
adults
.
.
.
more
or
less
.
So
is
this
a
valid
territorial
issue
?
Does
a
living
group
have
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
using
their
door
?
Is
there
any
such
thing
as
their
door
and
our
door
?
Is
there
some
unwritten
rule
that
you
can’t
cut
through
another
dormitory
?
Does
it
matter
which
dormitory
?
Does
an
individual
student
have
the
right
to
harass
a
passerby
?
The
answer
to
all
these
questions
is
a
resounding
no
.
Does
this
neighboring
dormitory
,
which
shall
remain
unnamed
,
get
a
pass
because
it
belongs
to
a
selective
living
group
?
One
can’t
help
but
think
that
if
a
fraternity
brother
stood
sentry
at
a
door
and
barked
at
non
brothers
,
it
would
become
a
scandal
,
especially
if
he
did
it
with
some
regularity
during
daylight
hours
.
Even
if
the
fraternity
didn’t
ask
the
brother
to
bark
,
the
organization
would
be
censured
for
not
keeping
him
on
a
tighter
leash
.
If
one
fraternity
brother
misbehaves
,
the
stigma
has
a
way
of
spilling
over
onto
everyone
.
That
is
reality
,
even
if
it’s
not
entirely
fair
.
The
selective
living
group
may
want
to
keep
this
in
mind
and
have
a
talk
with
their
barker
.
As
Duke
students
with
diverse
interests
and
a
multitude
of
organizations
to
join
,
it
may
be
tempting
to
divide
ourselves
into
insular
cliques
.
But
it
is
best
to
resist
the
unhealthy
urge
to
label
and
judge
each
other
by
stereotypes
.
It
creates
a
poisonous
atmosphere
,
one
that
is
not
conducive
to
learning
and
personal
growth
.
When
encountering
someone
from
a
different
organization
or
living
group
,
view
it
as
an
opportunity
to
enrich
yourself
rather
than
to
exclude
.
So
how
should
one
respond
to
a
barking
neighbor
?
Reach
out
.
Build
a
relationship
.
Maybe
even
toss
them
a
tasty
bone
.
If
the
urge
to
bark
proves
to
be
irresistible
,
bark
in
unison
rather
than
at
each
other
.
The
quad
will
be
a
better
place
.
On
September
25
,
DSG
voted
to
condemn
the
US
Department
of
Education
in
response
to
the
Department’s
criticism
over
a
university
sponsored
and
federally
funded
anti
Semitic
event
that
was
sponsored
by
Duke
and
UNC
this
past
spring
.
You
may
be
wondering
,
how
might
Jewish
students
feel
about
this
?
How
may
this
outcry
against
condemnation
of
anti
Semitism
land
on
Jewish
ears
?
As
a
member
of
the
Jewish
community
at
Duke
University
,
I
am
incredibly
disappointed
in
DSG
for
excluding
the
Jewish
community
in
any
discussion
regarding
the
resolution
there
was
no
effort
to
seek
the
larger
Jewish
perspective
on
this
not
so
complex
issue
.
nbsp
;
Though
DSG
has
made
a
statement
condemning
anti
Semitism
,
the
mere
act
of
passing
this
resolution
in
defense
of
the
Duke
UNC
CMES
department’s
conference
indicates
that
the
condemnation
of
anti
Semitism
was
an
empty
gesture
.
While
the
conflict
in
the
Middle
East
is
indubitably
one
of
the
most
confusing
,
involved
,
and
emotional
geopolitical
crises
known
to
man
,
the
matter
of
anti
Semitism
is
distinct
and
clear
.
The
failure
of
student
government
to
recognize
and
address
the
blatant
anti
Semitic
discourse
and
fervor
that
occurred
at
the
Conflict
Over
Gaza
Conference
is
astounding
.
The
presence
of
such
disgusting
expressions
of
prejudice
and
hatred
at
the
conference
spurred
the
condemnation
of
the
program
by
the
US
Department
of
Education
in
the
first
place
,
in
response
to
a
letter
that
was
sent
to
Betsy
DeVos
from
Representative
George
Holding
decrying
not
only
the
blatant
anti
Israel
bias
,
but
also
the
brazenly
anti
Semitic
song
performed
by
rapper
Tamer
Nafar
.
To
ignore
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
is
an
indication
that
DSG
has
no
semblance
of
an
idea
as
to
what
the
problem
actually
is
,
neglecting
the
context
that
prompted
the
investigation
.
The
root
problem
is
not
criticism
of
Israel
itself
or
academic
free
speech
,
but
the
outbreak
of
overt
anti
Semitism
seemingly
planned
in
advance
and
paid
for
with
federal
funding
.
DSG’s
conflation
of
free
speech
with
taxpayer
funded
hate
speech
should
raise
serious
questions
as
to
their
blind
acceptance
of
misinformation
and
capacity
to
address
the
concerns
of
the
Jewish
community
at
Duke
.
According
to
a
report
in
the
Chronicle
,
Senator
Omar
Benallal
spoke
against
tabling
the
resolution
on
the
grounds
that
the
pressing
nature
of
the
resolution
could
not
afford
the
lost
time
of
having
a
conversation
with
the
Duke
administration
.
What
exactly
does
this
mean
?
Does
it
mean
that
DSG
felt
the
need
to
act
so
quickly
in
order
to
deliberately
exclude
the
opinions
of
the
general
student
body
?
Maybe
the
Jewish
perspective
,
or
the
perspective
of
anyone
with
a
differing
viewpoint
,
was
not
a
desirable
one
to
consider
.
What
are
the
implications
of
this
thought
process
and
consequent
action
on
the
espoused
ideal
of
diverse
viewpoints
in
academic
instruction
at
Duke
University
and
within
DSG
,
then
?
Some
news
accounts
undoubtedly
some
that
our
fellow
students
have
read
have
implied
or
even
outright
stated
that
the
Department
of
Education
was
on
a
witch
hunt
for
instances
of
bias
.
It
can’t
be
called
much
of
a
hunt
when
the
taxpayer
funded
rapper
quite
literally
sang
the
words
Unquestionably
,
free
speech
,
and
even
hate
speech
itself
that
falls
under
this
umbrella
,
is
constitutionally
protected
.
Moreover
,
all
free
speech
should
arguably
have
its
place
at
a
university
,
where
all
ideas
should
be
subjected
to
debate
and
scrutiny
.
However
,
events
and
programs
that
encourage
anti
Semitism
or
racism
of
any
form
should
never
be
by
the
University
and
should
definitely
not
obtain
funding
by
taxpayer
dollars
.
By
passing
this
resolution
,
DSG
displays
a
deep
misunderstanding
of
the
difference
between
free
speech
and
speech
that
is
sponsored
by
Duke
and
the
federal
government
.
DSG’s
priorities
seem
to
be
to
stifle
discourse
and
further
divide
the
student
body
on
what
should
be
a
simple
choice
to
stand
in
solidarity
with
Jewish
peers
against
the
scourge
of
anti
Semitism
sponsored
and
promoted
by
their
academic
institution
.
The
U
.
S
.
Department
of
Education
was
not
trying
to
re
write
Duke’s
curriculum
,
and
it
is
ignorant
to
suggest
otherwise
.
Regardless
of
one’s
political
differences
with
the
leaders
of
the
DoE
,
blindness
to
the
impetus
of
the
entire
matter
anti
Semitism
backed
by
taxpayer
dollars
cannot
be
excused
.
It
is
not
necessary
to
agree
with
the
DoE’s
entire
letter
,
which
clearly
contains
bias
,
to
agree
with
the
ideological
paradigm
clearly
motivating
some
of
the
language
used
in
the
letter
,
or
to
believe
that
the
DoE
has
any
proper
solutions
for
fixing
the
Duke
UNC
Middle
East
curriculum
so
it
can
adhere
to
the
qualifications
for
federal
funding

Rather
,
all
I
am
suggesting
is
that
we
must
understand
why
the
letter
was
written
in
the
first
place
overt
anti
Semitism
sponsored
by
Duke
and
UNC
,
paid
for
by
taxpayers
.
DSG’s
decision
to
condemn
the
letter
without
seemingly
acknowledging
its
cause
is
yet
another
unprovoked
attack
on
the
Jewish
community
.
I
remember
New
York
City
being
bone
cold
the
March
of
my
freshman
year
.
I
was
standing
in
line
for
a
live
taping
of
Late
Night
with
Stephen
Colbert
.
It
was
Winter
Storm
Stella
that
March
,
and
I
huddled
outside
with
strangers
to
keep
warm
before
the
show
started
.
A
Californian
in
New
York
,
braving
a
storm
to
see
Stephen
Colbert
in
the
flesh
.
To
me
,
Colbert
was
a
celebrity
more
than
anything
else
.
I
didn’t
know
much
about
his
political
satire
and
had
never
watched
a
full
episode
of
his
show
.
I
remember
Colbert’s
in
house
jazz
band
Stay
Human
,
led
by
Jon
Batiste
.
I
remember
Colbert
sticking
his
head
in
a
microwave
for
a
bit
about
missing
Obama
.
Live
,
I
could
see
all
the
stage
makeup
Colbert
was
wearing
.
Ah
,
the
energy
and
dazzle
of
showbiz
.
Last
week
,
I
wrote
that
Pop
culture
and
politics
are
incestuously
close
,
which
got
me
thinking
about
Stephen
Colbert
.
And
late
night
television
.
And
the
role
of
lighthearted
comedy
in
serious
politics
,
a
combination
that
seems
inappropriate
but
in
practice
works
well
;
Late
Night
with
Stephen
Colbert
surpassed
The
Tonight
Show
with
Jimmy
Fallon
which
has
been
criticized
for
being
too
apolitical
and
took
the
top
spot
among
late
night
programs
in
the
prime
18
49
demographic
earlier
this
year
.
I’ve
been
a
pop
culture
spectator
for
far
longer
than
I’ve
been
a
vigilant
follower
of
the
news
.
I
don’t
remember
a
time
when
I
wasn’t
obsessed
with
watching
.
I
loved
celebrity
gossip
growing
up
,
and
in
high
school
,
I
went
to
dances
so
I
could
watch
other
people
dance
I
know
,
creepy
.
The
act
of
watching
might
seem
passive
,
but
eyeballs
glued
to
a
screen
can
also
act
like
currency
.
Viewership
translates
to
revenue
,
and
capturing
as
many
eyeballs
as
possible
brings
more
publicity
,
more
money
and
,
best
of
all
,
more
votes
.
There’s
a
well
worn
entertainment
industry
epithet
All
press
is
good
press
.
The
top
polling
candidates
for
the
democratic
nomination
have
the
most
followers
on
Twitter
.
The
last
two
democratic
debates
have
aired
on
different
network
television
companies
because
everyone
wants
a
cut
.
Late
night
programs
are
perfect
comedic
fodder
for
the
18
29
voter
demographic
who
seems
committed
to
a
hedonistic
entertainment
economy
.
Big
words
.
What
I
mean
is
that
I
and
most
of
my
friends
have
peanut
sized
attention
spans
.
If
something
doesn’t
catch
our
attention
,
we
scroll
and
move
on
.
Six
o’clock
news
and
the
daily
paper
that
gets
thrown
onto
the
lawn
are
two
things
that
require
a
feigned
propriety
I’d
rather
trade
in
for
my
phone
and
some
good
jokes
.
Late
night
shows
don’t
pretend
to
be
objective
or
put
together
like
news
journalism
.
In
fact
,
the
most
popular
late
night
shows
are
openly
left
leaning
and
cater
to
a
millenial
and
Gen
Z
demographic
that
is
more
Democrat
than
older
generations
.
The
entertainment
industry
has
a
reputation
for
being
raunchy
,
highly
volatile
,
glamorous
,
scandalous
,
drama
prone
all
the
things
that
hold
my
attention
.
Here
,
Trump’s
fake
news
tirade
against
mainstream
media
loses
steam
when
late
night
political
satire
already
beats
him
to
the
punchline
and
advertises
itself
as
fake
news
in
the
form
of
comedy
.
But
comedy
is
fraught
with
truth
.
Politics
disguised
in
comedy
can
trick
even
the
most
apolitical
into
tuning
into
current
events
.
Studies
have
shown
that
political
satire
on
late
night
television
is
a
gateway
for
paying
more
attention
to
politics
.
Maybe
that’s
the
way
in
late
night
programming
is
funny
,
consistent
and
convenient
after
a
long
day
of
doing
other
things
.
It’s
like
your
mom
sneaking
cold
medication
into
a
bottle
of
Coke
so
you
can
take
your
meds
while
also
getting
a
sugar
high
.
This
is
all
to
say
The

democratic
debates

A
chance
to
get
in
on
the
joke
.
We’ve
become
accustomed
to
a
number
of
luxuries
at
Duke
.
Some
of
us
have
been
afforded
such
privilege
our
entire
lives
;
for
others
,
these
indulgences
are
unique
to
this
campus
.
But
regardless
of
our
backgrounds
,
we
are
all
getting
a

notch
education
,
going
to

in

dozens
of
delicious
on
campus
restaurants
.
We’ve
gotten
used
to
that
.
I’ll
be
the
first
to
admit
that
I
often
forget
how
lucky
I
am
.
And
it’s
easy
to
see
why
most
of
the
time
,
we
run
around
this
school
like
chickens
with
our
heads
cut
off
,
bouncing
from
classes
to
extracurriculars
to
late
nights
in
Perkins
.
We
don’t
give
ourselves
time
to
reflect
.
But
there’s
a
difference
between
never
stopping
to
smell
the
roses
and
blatant
ungratefulness
.
Last
Wednesday
,
senior
Sami
Kirkpatrick
wrote
an
column
entitled
Don’t
eat
the
West
Union
fish
.
Apparently
,
Sami
had
unpleasant
experiences
at
both
JB’s
Chop
House
and
Ginger
and
Soy
,
and
thus
saw
fit
to
denounce
the
consumption
of
all
fish
throughout
the
dining
hall
.
He
concluded
that
these
experiences
demonstrate
Duke’s
focus
on
aesthetics
over
quality
,
which
,
in
the
case
of
West
Union
,
gives
vendors
the
confidence
to
attempt
dishes
they
have
no
business
attempting
.
I
have
no
interest
in
starting
a
feud
with
Sami
.
But
there
are
several
facets
of
his
column
that
stand
out
to
me
as
examples
of
the
disconcerting
privilege
we
witness
at
Duke
every
day
.
It’s
about
time
we
take
a
closer
look
at
the
implications
of
such
Duke
specific
complaints
.
For
every
amenity
at
Duke
,
there
are
people
behind
the
scenes
,
both
those
who
worked
to
bring
us
each
perk
and
those
who
keep
it
up
and
running
.
West
Union
didn’t
appear
out
of
nowhere
according
to
your
every
specific
preference
it
had
to
be
planned
,
funded
and
built
,
and
vendors
had
to
be
selected
,
contracted
and
prepared
to
operate
the
restaurants
daily
for
hundreds
of
customers
.
There
were
real
humans
involved
in
every
stage
of
that
process
.
When
you
issue
blanket
criticisms
about
West
Union’s
food
,
you
are
by
proxy
criticizing
all
of
the
individuals
who
work
tirelessly
,
and
for
modest
income
,
to
feed
you
things
you’ll
enjoy
.
People
in
the
service
industry
deserve
nothing
less
than
our
pure
gratitude
and
kindness
.
And
towards
the
idea
that
West
Union’s
architecture
gives
these
restaurants
undue
confidence
why
complain
about
the
fact
that
West
Union’s
vendors
want
to
create
dishes
that
mirror
the
grandeur
of
the
building
?
Is
it
not
evidence
of
a
restaurant’s
desire
for
quality
to
add
a
fancier
dish
to
the
menu
?
It’s
not
like
they’re
making
foods
that
they
have
no
business
attempting
for
their
own
pleasure
.
Plus
,
the
fact
that
JB’s
served
blackened
salmon
tip
pineapple
goulash
at
all
should
tip
you
off
to
the
fact
that
you
have
far
better
dining
options
than
the
average
college
student
.
If
it’s
still
not
good
enough
for
you
,
I’m
more
than
happy
to
take
it
off
your
hands
.
Sami’s
article
is
in
no
way
the
first
instance
I’ve
heard
such
criticisms
.
Duke
students
love
to
build
comradery
by
ragging
on
the
bus
schedule
,
the
cleanliness
of
the
bathroom
on
their
hall
or
the
fact
that
it
takes
them
10
minutes
to
get
from
their
dorm
to
class
compared
to
their
friend’s
five
.
I
get
it
complaining
about
minor
inconveniences
can
be
reflexive
,
even
cathartic
at
times
.
But
while
it
may
be
an
easy
conversation
topic
,
constant
complaining
can
contribute
to
your
risk
for
anxiety
and
depression
.
On
the
other
end
,
rewiring
your
brain
for
gratitude
can
decrease
that
risk
.
Plus
,
you
improve
the
lives
of
those
around
you
particularly
the
employees
you’d
otherwise
criticize
by
reducing
negativity
in
the
air
.
Even
though
I
hear
complaints
like
Sami’s
all
the
time
,
I
remain
routinely
fascinated
by
the
hills
Duke
students
choose
to
die
on
.
Racism
on
campus
?
The
prevalence
of
sexual
assault
?
Our
declining
mental
states
?
Not
interested
.
No
,
the
issue
that
needs
addressing
is
that
Red
Mango
just
doesn’t
hit
the
spot
quite
like
Quenchers
.
It
may
be
easier
to
address
our
trivial
concerns
than
these
underlying
phenomena
,
but
let’s
face
it
we
know
where
the
real
problems
are
.
We’re
just
really
good
at
ignoring
them
.
But
recognizing
this
tendency
isn’t
enough
we
should
redirect
our
energy
towards
genuinely
productive
dialogues
.
I
understand
the
importance
of
holding
Duke
accountable
even
for
the
minor
details
,
but
I’d
argue
that
we
have
a
greater
responsibility
to
hold
Duke
accountable
for
its
stated
commitment
to
protect
the
rights
and
identities
of
all
students
.
Where
are
you
when
those
issues
come
to
the
table
?
Eat
the
damn
salmon
and
figure
it
out
.
This
week
,
millions
of
people
across
the
world
are
participating
in
the
Global
Climate
Strike
to
call
for
the
end
of
fossil
fuels
usage
and
to
demand
climate
justice
.
Hundreds
of
people
gathered
for
the
Triangle
Climate
Strike
in
Raleigh
on
Friday
and
multiple
Duke
environmental
organizations
hosted
a
rally
right
here
on
campus
.
It’s
inspiring
to
see
how
much
momentum
has
grown
for
climate
action
.
In
recent
years
,
the
conversation
around
climate
change
has
progressed
substantially
.
At
first
,
climate
denial
was
the
primary
justification
for
those
who
resisted
action
.
Then
,
the
focus
moved
to
questioning
the
extent
to
which
humans
are
the
cause
.
As
the
Global
Climate
Strike
has
made
clear
,
the
crisis
of
climate
change
demands
action
.
Now
,
the
question
concerns
what
type
of
action
we
should
take
.
Being
fundamentally
an
optimist
,
as
the
title
of
my
column
would
suggest
,
I
believe
that
we
have
the
capacity
to
transition
away
from
fossil
fuels
,
helping
people
and
the
planet
,
while
also
growing
the
economy
.
I
also
believe
that
climate
change
does
not
need
to
be
a
wedge
issue
in
U
.
S
.
politics
;
rather
it
has
the
potential
to
build
a
bridge
between
Americans
with
varying
backgrounds
and
ideologies
.
This
belief
is
what
attracted
me
to
Citizens’
Climate
Lobby
CCL
,
a
non
profit
,
nonpartisan
grassroots
advocacy
organization
focused
on
national
policies
to
address
climate
change
.
CCL’s
core
values
include
optimism
,
relationships
,
being
nonpartisan
and
diversity
.
We
are
constantly
hearing
about
the
damage
caused
by
climate
change
,
the
lack
of
substantive
policies
being
implemented
to
address
it
and
actions
taken
to
undermine
progress
made
.
Not
only
is
it
disheartening
,
but
it
can
create
a
sense
of
hopelessness
.
Even
with
events
like
the
Global
Climate
Strike
,
it
may
feel
like
our
voices
aren’t
being
heard
by
the
people
who
need
to
hear
them
most
.
I
chose
to
get
involved
with
Citizens’
Climate
Lobby
because
it
offers
a
bipartisan
,
effective
climate
solution
and
has
made
significant
strides
in
building
the
political
will
to
achieve
its
goal
.
CCL’s
priority
is
getting
the
Energy
Innovation
and
Carbon
Dividend
Act
passed
in
Congress
and
signed
into
law
.
This
bill
would
reduce
U
.
S
.
carbon
emissions
by
40
in
12
years
and
by
over
90
by
the
year
2050
,
all
while
growing
the
economy
,
supporting
American
families
,
and
promoting
decarbonization
efforts
around
the
world
.
Here’s
how
the
policy
would
put
a
fee
on
fossil
fuels
which
would
start
low
and
grow
over
time
,
causing
energy
companies
,
industries
,
and
consumers
to
move
toward
cleaner
energy
.
This
will
generate
a
significant
amount
revenue
,
but
rather
than
members
of
Congress
fighting
over
how
to
spend
it
,
the
money
will
be
returned
to
the
American
people
as
a
carbon
dividend
.
The
policy
makes
sense
.
When
I
asked
Duke
Economics
professor
Christopher
Timmins
about
the
proposal
,
he
explained
that
carbon
taxes
take
a
complex
regulatory
problem
and
simplify
it
dramatically
by
making
people
pay
for
the
damage
that
their
decisions
inflict
on
the
atmosphere
.
Companies
that
provide
those
goods
and
services
will
respond
accordingly
by
changing
their
production
techniques
.
As
a
result
of
the
efficiency
and
effectiveness
,
Carbon
Fee
and
Dividend
has
been
endorsed
by
over
100
municipal
governments
including
Durham
County
,
newspaper
editorial
boards
nationwide
,
and
political
leaders
such
as
George
Schultz
who
served
in
three
Republican
Presidential
Administrations
including
as
Secretary
of
State
.
Since
being
introduced
by
a
Democrat
and
Republican
eight
months
ago
,
the
bipartisan
bill
has
garnered
62
co
sponsors
in
the
House
of
Representatives
,
including
North
Carolina
Representative
David
Price
who
represents
part
of
Durham
as
well
as
Raleigh
and
Chapel
Hill
.
There
has
been
climate
progress
across
Capitol
Hill
,
with
a
Democrat
and
Republican
Senator
announcing
the
creation
of
a
Senate
Climate
Solutions
Caucus
just
last
week
.
However
,
there
is
still
much
work
to
be
done
.
We
need
more
people
to
lobby
Congress
,
write
letters
to
the
editors
,
do
tabling
events
,
build
partnerships
,
and
spread
the
word
.
As
the
Duke
lead
for
CCL’s
Raleigh
Durham
chapter
,
I
am
working
to
get
more
students
and
members
of
the
campus
community
involved
in
this
important
mission
.
I
know
it
sounds
cliche
,
but
every
person
really
counts
.
It
could
be
your
initiative
that
gets
a
Duke
faculty
member
or
local
business
to
endorse
this
solution
.
It
could
be
your
letter
that
convinces
our
U
.
S
.
Representative
G
.
K
.
Butterfield
to
cosponsor
the
bill
.
It
could
be
your
voice
that
inspires
more
members
of
Congress
to
sign
on
during
a
Lobby
Day
in
Washington
D
.
C
.
The
time
for
action
is
now
.
If
you’re
tired
of
inaction
on
climate
change
and
want
to
be
part
of
the
Bipartisan
Climate
Solution
,
here
is
your
opportunity
.
Fill
out
this
form
to
get
involved
.
Only
through
widespread
and
urgent
action
can
we
tackle
this
existential
threat
.
This
editorial
,
published
by
the
Black
owned
on
May
6th
,
1939
,
powerfully
captures
the
ways
in
which
white
supremacy
has
rested
on
exploited
labor
to
shape
Duke
University
.
Despite
multiple
efforts
to
desegregate
the
school
and
continued
reliance
on
low
paid
,
poorly
treated
Black
labor
,
Black
students
could
not
attend
Duke
as
undergraduates
until
twenty
four
years
later
,
in
a
move
later
lauded
as
a
progressive
new
chapter
in
Duke’s
history
.
Desegregation
did
not
,
however
,
return
the
wealth
produced
by
and
stolen
from
Black
tobacco
workers
and
laborers
wealth
which
underpins
an
8
.
5
billion
dollar
endowment
and
scaffolds
our
Gothic
architecture
.
More
,
desegregation
did
not
disrupt
the
university’s
persistent
abuse
of
workers
who
daily
keep
the
university
running
,
a
pattern
that
stretches
from
1968
to
1998
to
2016
,
nor
did
it
prompt
official
recognition
of
institutional
complicity
in
slavery
and
segregation
.
Further
bound
up
in
a
place
built
by
and
for
white
men
,
as
the
editorial
named
,
was
the
marginalization
and
total
exclusion
of
LGBTQ
communities
,
women
,
low
income
and
disabled
students
,
workers
,
faculty
,
and
staff
.
While
the
University’s
maintenance
of
anti
Black
racism
and
economic
inequality
is
central
,
these
forms
of
violence
remain
linked
.
This
legacy
demands
the
university’s
acknowledgement
of
its
complicated
past
;
it
demands
that
Duke
remedy
these
harms
.
In
other
words
,
Duke
must
reckon
with
the
question
of
reparations
.
Communities
and
institutions
across
the
world
are
contending
with
violent
,
uncomfortable
histories
and
the
inequality
they
produced
.
National
political
conversations
about
reparations
have
exploded
,
sparking
testimony
on
Capitol
Hill
and
finding
a
place
in
the
platforms
of
Democratic
presidential
candidates
as
politicians
figure
out
how
to
address
centuries
long
enslavement
,
lynching
,
Jim
Crow
segregation
and
the
plundering
of
African
American
communities
.
Writers
,
scholars
,
and
activists
are
challenging
our
collective
consciousness
,
too
the
New
York
Times’
1619
Project
,
the
Equal
Justice
Initiative’s
memorial
to
the
victims
of
lynching
,
and
movements
like
the
Poor
People’s
Campaign
and
Black
Lives
Matter
insist
we
correct
our
incomplete
historical
narrative
.
Higher
education
is
not
immune
either
.
Furman
University
,
the
University
of
Glasgow
and
Georgetown
University
have
all
excavated
their
ties
to
slavery
and
the
international
slave
trade
,
implementing
multi
million
dollar
reparations
policies
of
their
own
.
Duke
itself
has
taken
some
initial
steps
to
confront
its
entanglement
in
white
supremacy
.
In
August
2017
,
the
toppling
of
the
Confederate
statue
in
downtown
Durham
quickly
forced
the
administration
to
remove
the
Robert
E
.
Lee
statue
from
the
entrance
to
the
Chapel
and
form
a
Commission
on
Memory
and
History
.
A
little
over
a
year
later
,
the
university
removed
the
violent
white
supremacist
Julian
Carr’s
name
from
a
building
on
East
Campus
after
pressure
from
People’s
State
of
the
University
and
the
Duke
History
Department
,
encouraged
by
the
efforts
of
activists
at
UNC
to
topple
Silent
Sam
.
Just
this
past
summer
,
President
Price
announced
a
new
Advisory
Committee
on
Institutional
History
to
engage
with
and
learn
from
Duke’s
history
while
Dean
Valerie
Ashby
announced
a
four
million
dollar
investment
into
African
,
Asian
American
and
Latinx
studies
faculty
.
This
history
,
only
briefly
summarized
here
,
has
consequences
.
It
manifests
systemically
in
racist
slurs
scrawled
in
safe
spaces
for
Black
students
,
white
supremacist
propaganda
slapped
onto
campus
benches
,
and
a
noose
hung
on
the
Bryan
Center
Plaza
.
This
history
fueled
controversy
over
the
light
rail
,
created
a
hostile
working
environment
in
the
Parking
and
Transportation
Office
,
subjected
housekeepers
to
unfair
,
disruptive
changes
in
work
schedules
and
hastened
gentrification
.
Lastly
,
though
not
finally
,
it
remains
etched
into
our
built
environment
where
white
men
are
vastly
overrepresented
in
statues
,
memorials
and
building
names
.
Every
day
we
sanitize
our
institution’s
history
we
compound
the
consequences
that
will
surely
become
its
legacy
.
We
maintain
a
Duke
that
is
fundamentally
unsafe
and
unjust
,
that
fails
in
its
responsibility
to
provide
a
welcoming
educational
environment
and
ensure
the
material
well
being
of
its
surrounding
community
.
Duke
especially
fails
those
who
still
live
,
study
and
work
in
spite
of
a
university
built
by
and
for
white
men
a
historical
fact
overdue
for
correction
.
I
don’t
pretend
to
know
the
full
scope
of
a
reparations
program
that
accounts
for
such
overwhelming
violence
.
Reparations
can
be
about
money
,
memorialization
,
changes
to
admissions
policies
or
faculty
hiring
or
a
topic
we
haven’t
yet
considered
.
Or
it
can
be
all
of
these
things
.
But
we
first
need
a
historically
accurate
and
far
more
robust
conversation
about
reparations
which
involves
all
of
our
community
members
,
and
,
given
those
most
impacted
,
does
not
center
my
perspective
nor
those
similarly
privileged
.
My
purpose
in
writing
this
is
to
argue
that
expanding
this
conversation
is
urgent
from
the
boardrooms
at
the
Washington
Duke
to
the
study
alcoves
tucked
away
in
Keohane’s
dorms
.
If
we
can
accept
reparations
as
a
moral
and
practical
necessity
,
we
can
ensure
a
future
strikingly
different
from
our
past
.
Five
years
from
now
,
the
university
will
mark
the
100th
anniversary
of
James
B
.
Duke’s
gift
transforming
Trinity
College
into
Duke
University
.
Before
then
,
it
has
some
old
ghosts
to
settle
.
The
Duke
case
for
reparations
is
clear
a
process
of
official
acknowledgement
,
historical
excavation
and
material
investment
that
President
Price’s
new
Advisory
Committee
can
set
into
motion
.
More
importantly
,
however
,
must
craft
the
framework
in
which
we
assert
the
moral
responsibility
of
reparations
,
a
responsibility
we’ve
inherited
as
beneficiaries
of
stolen
wealth
,
persecution
and
exclusion
and
as
members
of
a
community
where
poverty
,
housing
instability
and
precarious
labor
conditions
remain
entrenched
.
Perhaps
historical
clarity
will
permanently
displace
deeply
rooted
,
persuasive
myths
of
a
nimble
,
innovative
and
progressive
Duke
,
and
free
us
to
do
the
hard
,
slow
work
brought
forth
by
a
long
overdue
reckoning
.
What
would
it
look
like
for
your
pain
to
take
up
space
?
asked
my
therapist
,
rephrasing
a
question
I
have
been
asking
about
a
thousand
different
ways
,
in
conversations
with
most
of
the
people
I
love
,
for
at
least
eleven
years
.
I
have
been
in
pain
for
most
of
my
life
.
I
was
diagnosed
with
scoliosis
when
I
was
ten
years
old
.
I
wore
a
back
brace
twenty
four
hours
a
day
,
seven
days
a
week
,
for
the
next
five
years
.
When
bracing
failed
to
stop
my
spine
from
being
crooked
,
I
had
spinal
fusion
surgery
.
I
was
seventeen
,
the
summer
before
I
started
my
senior
year
of
high
school
.
The
goal
was
to
make
my
back
hurt
less
by
making
it
straight
.
But
after
my
doctor
drilled
two
titanium
rods
,
six
hooks
,
and
eight
screws
into
my
now
straight
spine
,
and
I
spent
months
getting
better
from
a
surgery
that
was
harder
than
I
could
have
imagined
,
my
back
did
not
hurt
less
.
If
anything
,
it
hurt
more
.
I’ve
spent
the
past
four
years
trying
to
make
this
constant
,
intense
,
lingering
pain
disappear
.
It
wasn’t
until
April
of
this
year
,
though
,
that
I
saw
a
doctor
who
told
me
what
I
had
known
but
refused
to
believe
this
body
was
not
going
to
get
better
.
I
can
treat
the
pain
,
but
I
cannot
make
it
go
away
.
It
is
not
temporary
.
It
is
something
that
is
and
will
always
be
inherent
to
me
where
this
body
goes
,
so
too
will
this
pain
.
It
is
not
a
condition
;
it’s
an
identity
.
I
spend
a
lot
of
time
at
Duke
,
inside
and
outside
of
the
classroom
,
talking
about
identity
.
I
study
African
American
Studies
and
English
so
questions
of
identity
especially
race
and
gender
are
at
the
forefront
of
most
of
the
classes
I’ve
taken
.
I
am
accustomed
to
talking
about
how
an
author
or
decision
maker’s
identity
impacts
what
they
say
and
do
,
and
how
people
of
privileged
identities
so
often
do
and
say
harmful
,
violent
,
and
oppressive
things
as
a
result
of
their
identification
with
an
empowered
identity
.
I
knew
that
identity
is
not
always
something
immediately
discernible
by
looking
at
someone
,
and
that
the
only
thing
we
can
assume
about
each
other
is
our
complexity
.
That’s
why
introducing
oneself
with
one’s
pronouns
is
so
important
,
why
assuming
a
person’s
race
based
on
their
phenotype
is
wrong
,
why
treating
everybody
as
if
they
are
heterosexual
,
cisgender
,
middle
class
,
and
do
not
have
a
disability
is
harmful
.
Even
so
,
I’ve
had
a
difficult
time
treating
chronic
pain
as
an
identity
.
Am
I
a
person
with
a
disability
,
someone
who
has
a
physical
or
mental
impairment
that
substantially
limits
one
or
more
major
life
activity
?
Does
it
count
as
a
disability
,
even
if
my
ability
fluctuates
day
to
day
,
if
I
don’t
have
a
specific
diagnosis
beyond
the
diagnosis
of
chronic
pain
,
if
my
body
looks
like
a
body
that
doesn’t
have
a
disability
?
If
I
were
to
say
that
I
am
a
person
with
a
disability
,
would
I
be
appropriating
the
term
,
soaking
up
resources
and
attention
that
should
go
to
people
with
real
disabilities
?
What
would
it
look
like
for
this
pain
to
take
up
space
?
I
fear
talking
about
chronic
pain
because
I
am
still
asking
all
of
these
questions
.
I
don’t
know
what
to
call
it
,
and
I
don’t
know
whether
it
matters
what
I
call
it
.
I
don’t
know
how
much
of
it
to
share
with
the
people
I
love
,
knowing
that
neither
they
nor
I
can
fix
it
.
I
fear
this
pain
taking
up
space
,
even
in
the
space
of
this
column
.
At
what
point
is
it
not
worth
talking
about
,
since
the
only
person
whose
life
it
will
change
is
mine
?
When
I
find
myself
going
down
that
spiral
one
of
shame
and
silence
I
remind
myself
that
this
pain
has
changed
many
lives
alongside
my
own
.
It
has
changed
the
lives
of
my
family
,
my
friends
,
my
partner
.
I
wish
it
hadn’t
.
But
it
is
always
taking
up
space
,
even
if
I
try
to
shrink
it
down
to
fit
inside
my
body
and
my
body
alone
.
I
also
remind
myself
that
the
world
is
not
built
for
people
with
chronic
pain
.
The
world
at
large
,
and
particularly
the
world
of
Duke
,
assumes
able
bodiedness
to
be
the
norm
as
it
assumes
whiteness
,
assumes
maleness
,
assumes
a
binary
gender
identity
,
assumes
mental
health
,
assumes
wealth
,
assumes
heterosexuality
,
assumes
Americanness
,
assumes
privilege
.

The
fact
that
I
can
ignore
most
of
the
ways
our
world
and
our
campus
privileges
normative
,
historically
empowered
identities
,
that
I
can
opt
in
to
those
conversations
but
exist
mostly
comfortably
in
my
positionality
,
is
a
function
of
being
white
and
straight
and
cisgendered
and
upper
middle
class
and
passing
as
a
person
who
does
not
have
a
different
ability
status
.
The
world
privileges
most
of
my
intersecting
identities
,
so
I
am
often
granted
the
privilege
of
ignorance
.
Chronic
pain
has
added
another
intersection
to
my
identity
,
one
that
reminds
me
everywhere
I
go
that
our
structures
from
how
our
buildings
are
built
to
how
are
classrooms
are
run
are
not
meant
for
people
with
disabilities
.
I
cannot
opt
out
of
that
conversation
.
Ability
takes
up
space
in
my
life
and
in
the
lives
of
all
of
us
whether
I
want
it
to
or
not
.
I
don’t
know
what
it
would
mean
for
this
pain
to
take
up
space
in
ways
that
go
beyond
the
space
this
pain
takes
up
in
my
mind
and
in
conversations
with
other
people
.
I
don’t
know
how
to
take
up
space
in
an
intentional
way
,
in
a
way
that
may
make
living
in
the
world
easier
for
me
and
for
other
people
with
chronic
pain
.
But
I’m
going
to
keep
writing
about
it
,
talking
about
it
,
treating
it
as
an
identity
that
intersects
with
all
of
my
other
identities
and
all
of
your
identities
,
too
.
I’m
going
to
let
it
take
up
space
even
when
it
scares
me
.
I
hope
you
will
join
me
.
Throughout
my
life
,
I
have
grown
up
under
the
influence
of
Islam
.
Well
.
.
.
kinda
.
My
mom
is
Muslim
,
but
because
my
dad
is
Hindu
,
I
have
never
been
completely
immersed
within
the
strict
rules
of
the
former
religion
,
like
praying
five
times
a
day
or
fasting
for
the
entire
month
of
Ramadan
.
Despite
this
,
when
I
was
younger
,
my
sisters
and
I
would
accompany
my
mom
to
a
large
mosque
in
Queens
,
where
I
would
sit
quietly
,
tracing
patterns
in
the
carpet
,
while
a
voice
would
boom
over
my
head
in
a
language
I
didn’t
understand
.
It
was
fine
,
for
a
seven
year
old
who
didn’t
have
much
else
to
do
and
recognized
that
many
other
kids
around
her
also
spent
time
in
church
or
temple
.
But
as
I
grew
older
and
began
to
resist
these
trips
,
my
mom
continued
to
enforce
these
ideas
of
how
religion
was
an
integral
part
of
our
identity
and
how
it
was
necessary
to
thank
God
for
what
we
had
given
.
At
the
same
time
,
all
my
peers
around
me
stopped
mentioning
church
or
synagogue
.
I
suppose
many
parents
gave
up
on
dragging
their
kids
to
religious
worship
as
students
became
weighted
with
other
responsibilities
,
like
academics
or
sports
.
It
began
to
dawn
on
me
that
almost
no
one
I
knew
my
age
was
religious
;
not
a
single
one
of
my
friends
went
to
any
type
of
weekly
worship
anymore
.
Religion
wasn’t
mentioned
in
school
,
social
settings
,
or
with
your
friends
.
It
simply
wasn’t
an
everyday
part
of
our
culture
.
But
my
mother
didn’t
know
that
and
quite
frankly
,
probably
didn’t
care
.
As
she
continued
to
preach
to
me
the
importance
of
religion
,
the
impact
of
her
ideas
weakened
on
me
once
I
began
to
see
the
reduced
role
of
religion
among
my
peers
and
in
my
society
.
Maybe
her
religious
piety
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
she
was
from
India
.
But
more
realistically
,
it
probably
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
she
was
from
a
different
generation
than
me
.
Time
can
change
a
lot
,
and
one
thing
I
believe
it
has
changed
is
the
connection
young
adults
,
especially
in
America
,
feel
to
religion
.
Around
the
world
,
young
people
are
becoming
less
and
less
in
touch
with
religion
.
They
are
less
likely
to
be
religiously
affiliated
and
less
like
to
attend
weekly
worship
.
Specifically
in
the
United
States
,
where
Christianity
is
the
dominant
religion
,
church
membership
has
dropped
more
than
20
percent
since
1999
and
hundreds
of
churches
have
been
closing
,
at
a
rate
three
or
four
times
faster
than
the
rate
at
which
churches
are
being
built
.
nbsp
;
In
fact
,
about
one
third
of
young
Americans
say
they
don’t
belong
to
any
religion
.
Although
these
findings
made
me
feel
somewhat
relieved
that
I
am
not
a
religious
enigma
that
didn’t
feel
an
instant
devotion
to
God
,
I
still
wondered
Why
is
this
happening
?
Why
do
we
,
as
young
Americans
,
not
depend
on
religion
the
way
our
parents
and
grandparents
had
?
One
common
theory
about
this
shift
away
from
religion
is
the
growing
economic
mobility
and
status
of
young
Americans
.
As
time
goes
on
,
generations
are
less
likely
to
be
constantly
worried
about
day
to
day
finances
,
and
thus
,
less
likely
to
turn
to
a
third
party
,
God
,
in
the
hopes
of
economic
security
.
nbsp
;
Another
potential
reason
for
the
decline
of
religion
is
the
growing
individualistic
culture
of
the
United
States
.
People
in
our
society
strive
to
be
independent
and
self
sufficient
.
Essentially
,
why
depend
on
God
when
you
can
depend
on
yourself
?
But
the
reason
that
resonates
most
with
me
,
one
that
is
not
addressed
all
that
frequently
,
is
how
the
diversity
of
religions
experienced
while
growing
up
in
the
United
States
may
blur
the
connection
one
feels
to
their
own
religion
.
Growing
up
as
a
religious
minority
in
America
,
I
constantly
celebrated
the
glorified
events
of
other
religions
.
During
Christmas
time
,
there
was
a
tiny
tree
in
the
corner
of
our
living
room
,
embellished
with
wrapped
gifts
in
the
morning
.
Every
Easter
,
we
would
race
around
our
family
friend’s
house
to
find
hidden
plastic
pastel
eggs
,
filled
with
treasures
of
candy
.
In
middle
school
,
the
upcoming
bar
mitzvah
or
bat
mitzvah
felt
like
the
most
exciting
social
event
of
our
whole
lives
.
.
.
until
the
next
one
came
around
.
Simultaneously
,
my
own
religion
didn’t
feel
so
exciting
.
The
mosques
we
went
to
were
in
the
basement
of
a
church
or
just
at
someone’s
house
.
Eid
was
just
a
day
,
and
fasting
was
just
something
I
had
to
do
every
once
in
a
while
.
Being
exposed
to
a
diverse
amount
of
religions
and
even
experiencing
them
definitely
lessened
the
link
I
felt
to
my
own
religion
or
any
at
all
.
In
comparison
to
the
shiny
,
publicized
culture
of
other
religions
,
my
religion
felt
different
,
like
it
was
hiding
in
the
shadows
.
I
had
no
steadfast
community
that
I
really
connected
with
religiously
,
but
at
the
same
time
,
surprisingly
,
many
of
my
friends
,
religious
minorities
or
not
,
did
not
either
.
The
question
that
ultimately
comes
to
me
is
Would
I
be
religious
if
I
had
grown
up
in
a
community
that
belonged
to
the
same
religion
as
me
?
And
to
that
question
,
I
may
never
know
the
answer
.
But
I
have
always
been
skeptical
in
nature
about
information
.
And
centering
my
life
around
a
book
that
a
bunch
of
old
people
wrote
a
long
time
ago
?
Well
,
that’s
no
exception
.
Senior
Leah
Abrams
,
The
Chronicle's
Editorial
Page
Editor
,
hosts
a
live
discussion
with
two
columnists
Alice
Dai
and
Elliott
Davis
following
the
Democratic
Party's
Presidential
Debate
.
This
editorial
,
published
by
the
Black
owned
on
May
6th
,
1939
,
powerfully
captures
the
ways
in
which
white
supremacy
has
rested
on
exploited
labor
to
shape
Duke
University
.
Despite
multiple
efforts
to
desegregate
the
school
and
continued
reliance
on
low
paid
,
poorly
treated
Black
labor
,
Black
students
could
not
attend
Duke
as
undergraduates
until
twenty
four
years
later
,
in
a
move
later
lauded
as
a
progressive
new
chapter
in
Duke’s
history
.
Desegregation
did
not
,
however
,
return
the
wealth
produced
by
and
stolen
from
Black
tobacco
workers
and
laborers
wealth
which
underpins
an
8
.
5
billion
dollar
endowment
and
scaffolds
our
Gothic
architecture
.
More
,
desegregation
did
not
disrupt
the
university’s
persistent
abuse
of
workers
who
daily
keep
the
university
running
,
a
pattern
that
stretches
from
1968
to
1998
to
2016
,
nor
did
it
prompt
official
recognition
of
institutional
complicity
in
slavery
and
segregation
.
Further
bound
up
in
a
place
built
by
and
for
white
men
,
as
the
editorial
named
,
was
the
marginalization
and
total
exclusion
of
LGBTQ
communities
,
women
,
low
income
and
disabled
students
,
workers
,
faculty
,
and
staff
.
While
the
University’s
maintenance
of
anti
Black
racism
and
economic
inequality
is
central
,
these
forms
of
violence
remain
linked
.
This
legacy
demands
the
university’s
acknowledgement
of
its
complicated
past
;
it
demands
that
Duke
remedy
these
harms
.
In
other
words
,
Duke
must
reckon
with
the
question
of
reparations
.
Communities
and
institutions
across
the
world
are
contending
with
violent
,
uncomfortable
histories
and
the
inequality
they
produced
.
National
political
conversations
about
reparations
have
exploded
,
sparking
testimony
on
Capitol
Hill
and
finding
a
place
in
the
platforms
of
Democratic
presidential
candidates
as
politicians
figure
out
how
to
address
centuries
long
enslavement
,
lynching
,
Jim
Crow
segregation
and
the
plundering
of
African
American
communities
.
Writers
,
scholars
,
and
activists
are
challenging
our
collective
consciousness
,
too
the
New
York
Times’
1619
Project
,
the
Equal
Justice
Initiative’s
memorial
to
the
victims
of
lynching
,
and
movements
like
the
Poor
People’s
Campaign
and
Black
Lives
Matter
insist
we
correct
our
incomplete
historical
narrative
.
Higher
education
is
not
immune
either
.
Furman
University
,
the
University
of
Glasgow
and
Georgetown
University
have
all
excavated
their
ties
to
slavery
and
the
international
slave
trade
,
implementing
multi
million
dollar
reparations
policies
of
their
own
.
Duke
itself
has
taken
some
initial
steps
to
confront
its
entanglement
in
white
supremacy
.
In
August
2017
,
the
toppling
of
the
Confederate
statue
in
downtown
Durham
quickly
forced
the
administration
to
remove
the
Robert
E
.

.
A
little
over
a
year
later
,
the
university
removed
the
violent
white
supremacist
Julian
Carr’s
name
from
a
building
on
East
Campus
after
pressure
from
People’s
State
of
the
University
and
the
Duke
History
Department
,
encouraged
by
the
efforts
of
activists
at
UNC
to
topple
Silent
Sam
.
Just
this
past
summer
,
President
Price
announced
a
new
Advisory
Committee
on
Institutional
History
to
engage
with
and
learn
from
Duke’s
history
while
Dean
Valerie
Ashby
announced
a
four
million
dollar
investment
into
African
,
Asian
American
and
Latinx
studies
faculty
.
This
history
,
only
briefly
summarized
here
,
has
consequences
.
It
manifests
systemically
in
racist
slurs
scrawled
in
safe
spaces
for
Black
students
,
white
supremacist
propaganda
slapped
onto
campus
benches
,
and
a
noose
hung
on
the
Bryan
Center
Plaza
.
This
history
fueled
controversy
over
the
light
rail
,
created
a
hostile
working
environment
in
the
Parking
and
Transportation
Office
,
subjected
housekeepers
to
unfair
,
disruptive
changes
in
work
schedules
and
hastened
gentrification
.
Lastly
,
though
not
finally
,
it
remains
etched
into
our
built
environment
where
white
men
are
vastly
overrepresented
in
statues
,
memorials
and
building
names
.
Every
day
we
sanitize
our
institution’s
history
we
compound
the
consequences
that
will
surely
become
its
legacy
.
We
maintain
a
Duke
that
is
fundamentally
unsafe
and
unjust
,
that
fails
in
its
responsibility
to
provide
a
welcoming
educational
environment
and
ensure
the
material
well
being
of
its
surrounding
community
.
Duke
especially
fails
those
who
still
live
,
study
and
work
in
spite
of
a
university
built
by
and
for
white
men
a
historical
fact
overdue
for
correction
.
I
don’t
pretend
to
know
the
full
scope
of
a
reparations
program
that
accounts
for
such
overwhelming
violence
.
Reparations
can
be
about
money
,
memorialization
,
changes
to
admissions
policies
or
faculty
hiring
or
a
topic
we
haven’t
yet
considered
.
Or
it
can
be
all
of
these
things
.
But
we
first
need
a
historically
accurate
and
far
more
robust
conversation
about
reparations
which
involves
all
of
our
community
members
,
and
,
given
those
most
impacted
,
does
not
center
my
perspective
nor
those
similarly
privileged
.
My
purpose
in
writing
this
is
to
argue
that
expanding
this
conversation
is
urgent
from
the
boardrooms
at
the
Washington
Duke
to
the
study
alcoves
tucked
away
in
Keohane’s
dorms
.
If
we
can
accept
reparations
as
a
moral
and
practical
necessity
,
we
can
ensure
a
future
strikingly
different
from
our
past
.
Five
years
from
now
,
the
university
will
mark
the
100th
anniversary
of
James
B
.
Duke’s
gift
transforming
Trinity
College
into
Duke
University
.
Before
then
,
it
has
some
old
ghosts
to
settle
.
The
Duke
case
for
reparations
is
clear
a
process
of
official
acknowledgement
,
historical
excavation
and
material
investment
that
President
Price’s
new
Advisory
Committee
can
set
into
motion
.
More
importantly
,
however
,
must
craft
the
framework
in
which
we
assert
the
moral
responsibility
of
reparations
,
a
responsibility
we’ve
inherited
as
beneficiaries
of
stolen
wealth
,
persecution
and
exclusion
and
as
members
of
a
community
where
poverty
,
housing
instability
and
precarious
labor
conditions
remain
entrenched
.
Perhaps
historical
clarity
will
permanently
displace
deeply
rooted
,
persuasive
myths
of
a
nimble
,
innovative
and
progressive
Duke
,
and
free
us
to
do
the
hard
,
slow
work
brought
forth
by
a
long
overdue
reckoning
.
The
average
Duke
student
might
look
to
enjoy
some
sun
and
Beyú
Blue
coffee
on
the
Bryan
Center
Plaza
this
Saturday
.
However
,
they
may
not
be
aware
of
the
climate
strike
that
will
be
happening
,
with
just
128
individuals
less
than
1
of
all
Duke
students
interested
in
the
Facebook
event
as
of
the
beginning
of
this
week
.
This
strike
coincides
with
the
climate
strike
in
Raleigh
on
Friday
as
part
of
a
global
climate
strike
.
Demanding
the
end
of
fossil
fuel
use
,
the
movement
has
been
led
by
youth
like
Greta
Thunberg
,
the
16
years
old
activist
who
has
skipped
school
every
Friday
for
over
a
year
to
demonstrate
outside
the
Swedish
parliament
and
the
White
House
last
week
.
Perhaps
it’s
not
surprising
how
little
energy
the
climate
strikes
have
garnered
at
Duke
.
nbsp
;
This
is
evidenced
by
how
some
students
comfortably
host
hurricane
parties
and
don’t
question
how
workers
dutifully
clear
our
sidewalks
in
the
wake
of
a
mere
inch
of
snow
.
Meanwhile
,
the
millions
of
people
most
affected
by
the
climate
crisis
who
are
disproportionately
low
income
,
nbsp
;
racial
minorities
and
indigenous
have
suffocated
from
wildfires
across
California
,
the
Amazon
and
Madagascar
;
been
swamped
by
sea
level
rise
in
the
Marshall
Islands
,
Jakarta
and
Dar
es
Salaam
;
and
been
hammered
by
increasingly
severe
hurricanes
in
Puerto
Rico
,
the
Bahamas
and
the
NC
Outer
Banks
.
For
others
who
do
care
,
there
seems
to
be
a
tendency
towards
the
nihilistic
intellectualization
of
traumatic
disasters
alongside
the
celebration
of
superficially
impactful
vegetarianism
,
metal
straws
and
weekly
recycling
.
However
,
this
nihilism
,
those
individual
actions
,
are
privileges
,
and
they
still
bear
complicity
in
the
suffocation
,
dislocation
and
ruination
of
others
by
this
crisis
.
Thus
far
,
demanding
individual
and
institutional
accountability
has
made
little
headway
in
solving
the
climate
crisis
.
While
we
may
highlight
Duke’s
feeble
and
opaque
divestment
efforts
or
environmentally
dubious
interest
in
biogas
and
even
push
Duke
to
shut
down
its
plans
for
a
natural
gas
power
plant
,
the
University
,
so
it
seems
,
remains
preoccupied
with
profit
first
and
the
planet
second
.
Around
the
country
,
wealthy
elites
behave
similarly
,
regarding
freshwater
scarcity
as
an
investment
opportunity
or
buying
personal
securities
like
Kim
Kardashian’s
private
firefighters
or
Oprah’s
private
roads
.
In
each
of
these
instances
,
elite
individuals
and
institutions
tend
to
make
decisions
based
on
private
profit
,
efficiency
and
or
cost
benefit
pragmatism
neoliberal
,
late
capitalist
logics
that
are
directly
antithetical
to
environmental
sustainability
.
Admittedly
,
it's
hard
to
shed
cost
benefit
frameworks
and
act
purely
on
morality
just
as
it’s
hard
to
swim
against
the
neoliberal
cultural
tide
at
Duke
of
seamless
control
and
perfection
.
But
how
the
environment
without
regard
for
the
price
tag
?
We
must
recognize
that
it
is
no
longer
sufficient
to
demand
accountability
for
wrongdoing
as
a
reaction
.
Rather
,
we
must
proactively
work
towards
an
environmentally
sustainable
economic
system
that
operates
with
an
aligning
set
of
moral
obligations
for
the
planet
and
for
all
,
not
just
the
upper
echelon
.
This
includes
understanding
and
deconstructing
how
we
participate
in
maintaining
that
system
.
As
students
who
will
cycle
out
of
the
University
and
carry
its
benefits
with
us
,
we
ought
to
recognize
our
potential
power
as
a
collective
and
come
together
to
demand
that
Duke
invests
in
public
transportation
,
native
plants
,
clean
energy
technology
or
alternatives
to
our
exorbitant
and
water
consumptive
grass
like
mulch
or
synthetic
lawn
.
The
actions
we
take
or
don’t
take
,
whether
they
feel
intentional
,
are
guided
by
choices
that
we
have
control
over
.
With
the
current
climate
catastrophe
and
the
trauma
it
has
already
inflicted
on
millions
around
the
world
,
we
can
no
longer
to
choose
inaction
.
No
matter
whether
we
resign
ourselves
to
fatalism
or
salvage
hope
in
preservation
,
we
must
live
up
to
our
own
critiques
of
those
with
institutional
power
,
shedding
our
individualism
in
favor
of
collective
action
.
We
can
educate
ourselves
on
environmental
in
justice
,
participate
in
advocacy
like
the
Sunrise
Movement
,
disobediently
demand
larger
shifts
toward
community
land
ownership
and
cooperative
labor
or
attend
the
climate
protests
.
Because
to
do
all
that
we
can
to
solve
the
climate
crisis
is
to
embody
the
values
we
praise
and
realize
the
world
we
want
to
live
in
one
that
cares
about
people
and
planet
,
profits
be
damned
.
Dear
newest
Blue
Devils
,
I
first
want
to
congratulate
you
not
only
on
getting
into
a
school
like
Duke
,
but
also
on
successfully
getting
through
these
last
couple
of
weeks
,
which
have
undoubtedly
been
a
microcosm
of
your
larger
journey
toward
getting
here
.
Between
packing
up
all
of
your
belongings
,
leaving
the
comfort
of
a
familiar
zip
code
,
and
saying
goodbye
at
least
temporarily
to
family
and
friends
who
have
been
by
your
side
since
the
beginning
,
I
know
what
a
whirlwind
these
last
twenty
something
days
must
have
been
.
Now
that
O
Week
has
wrapped
up
,
how
relieving
it
must
be
to
just
.

In
closing

I’ll
leave
you
with
this
for
all
of
the
difficulty
I’ve
already
shared
with
you
surrounding
my
original
transition
to
Duke
,
saying
goodbye
to
Duke
three
and
a
half
months
ago
might
have
been
even
more
challenging
.
That’s
because
after
forcing
myself
to
put
into
practice
all
that
I’ve
shared
with
you
above
,
it
happened
Duke
became
my
home
too
a
home
I
would’ve
happily
never
left
if
I
didn’t
have
to
.
And
if
you’ve
already
got
a
plan
for
how
you
are
going
to
find
the
communities
at
Duke
in
which
you
feel
like
you
belong
,
then
you’re
already
better
than
the
author
of
this
letter
,
and
there’s
not
a
doubt
in
my
mind
that
Duke
will
soon
become
your
home
too
.
Wishing
you
all
the
best
in
this
exciting
next
chapter
,
and
as
always
,
GTHC

Sincerely
,
Rob
Palmisano
Class
of
2019
When
I
first
applied
to
Duke
,
I
honestly
didn’t
think
too
much
about
it
.
I
applied
to
highly
ranked
schools
almost
systematically
,
and
Duke
was
ranked
highly
I
also
loved
basketball
,
so
its
elite
program
was
a
bonus
.
When
the
dust
cleared
and
Duke
was
the
top
choice
that
accepted
me
,
I
was
surprised
because
I
never
seriously
thought
about
coming
here
.
But
when
I
visited
for
Blue
Devil
Days
after
Ubering
from
RDU
,
something
just
clicked
in
my
mind
.
From
my
first
steps
on
campus
,
I
could
feel
the
atmosphere
percolate
with
beauty
,
intellect
and
even
a
sense
of
homeliness
.
I
saw
myself
spending
the
next
four
years
here
,
and
I
couldn’t
have
been
happier
that
I
found
Duke
.
Two
years
later
,
I
am
halfway
through
my
time
at
Duke
.
And
as
much
as
I
loved
my
first
two
years
as
a
Blue
Devil
,
I
quickly
came
to
realize
that
the
world
ain’t
all
sunshine
and
rainbows
.
I’ve
never
been
the
best
at
managing
stress
and
anxiety
,
and
my
time
at
Duke
induced
them
in
levels
that
I
simply
couldn’t
handle
.
By
the
end
of
sophomore
year
,
I
started
thinking
about
taking
a
gap
year
very
seriously
.
At
first
,
I
framed
it
around
the
timing
and
the
particular
opportunity
I
was
trying
to
pursue
.
But
when
I
realized
in
early
June
that
I
would
probably
never
hear
back
from
my
dream
job
,
I
started
considering
why
I
truly
wanted
to
take
a
gap
year
.
I
concluded
that
I
needed
to
get
out
of
the
Duke
bubble
,
and
I
came
to
this
conclusion
by
comparing
my
anxiety
inside
and
outside
of
a
Duke
facilitated
environment
.
But
I
started
to
question
this
reasoning
when
I
felt
no
anxiety
during
an
internship
that
was
completely
coordinated
by
Duke
.
After
a
few
weeks
of
rest
post
finals
this
past
May
,
I
spent
two
months
in
Miami
through
DukeEngage
.
We
stayed
on
the
University
of
Miami’s
campus
,
so
while
there
were
some
logistical
barriers
from
the
city’s
livelihood
,
the
experience
felt
fairly
immersive
.
By
staying
busy
with
work
and
social
outings
,
there
were
moments
where
I
would
forget
that
Duke
planned
this
entire
program
.
And
even
when
I
recognized
Duke’s
role
in
this
opportunity
,
I
never
felt
encapsulated
in
a
bubble
the
way
I
did
on
campus
.
While
there
were
no
obvious
physical
manifestations
of
Duke’s
influence
within
the
cityscape
of
Miami
,
and
I
certainly
was
not
taking
courses
taught
by
Duke
professors
,
there
must
have
been
some
other
reason
why
I
never
felt
constantly
overwhelmed
when
so
many
of
my
experiences
there
had
a
direct
connection
to
this
university
.
If
you
ask
me
,
those
representations
of
Duke
only
tell
part
of
the
story
because
the
bubble
is
entirely
mental
.
Constant
physical
reminders
of
Duke
aren’t
helpful
,
but
they
only
make
you
feel
trapped
if
you’re
already
overwhelmed
the
Duke
bubble
is
simply
the
overwhelming
feeling
associated
with
our
lifestyles
at
Duke
.
Maybe
I’m
being
really
naive
by
allowing
myself
to
have
this
realization
while
I’m
not
taking
classes
or
spending
time
in
Durham
,
but
my
clear
headedness
through
eight
weeks
under
Duke’s
supervision
proves
to
me
how
artificial
the
bubble
is
.
That
doesn’t
mean
it
isn’t
real
;
classes
are
just
starting
,
and
I
can
already
feel
surrounded
again
.
But
what
it
does
mean
is
that
maybe
we
can
escape
without
leaving
it
physically
.
We
already
do
this
one
way
or
another
,
whether
it’s
through
clubs
,
exercise
,
parties
,
music
or
whatever
you
do
to
help
cope
;
the
problem
with
coping
mechanisms
is
that
they’re
only
short
term
solutions
.
Most
of
us
do
these
things
as
a
reaction
to
stress
when
they
should
really
become
integral
parts
of
our
lifestyle
as
important
as
meals
,
sleep
and
classes
.
We
react
when
we’re
overwhelmed
,
but
the
only
way
to
stop
feeling
trapped
is
to
make
sure
we
take
care
of
ourselves
before
we
even
get
overwhelmed
in
the
first
place
.
Do
I
believe
that
I
can
honestly
do
this
for
myself
?
No
.
At
least
not
right
away
.
With
my
obsessive
personality
and
my
tendency
to
fall
into
unhealthy
patterns
,
I
know
that
I
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
before
I
can
be
a
Duke
student
without
being
part
of
the
bubble
.
But
for
once
,
I
feel
like
doing
that
work
is
actually
possible
.
For
the
few
days
I
had
on
campus
before
classes
started
,
I
took
steps
to
implement
healthy
habits
that
I
hope
to
continue
through
the
semester
if
not
longer
.
I’m
afraid
that
my
lifestyle
will
immediately
worsen
once
I
get
into
the
weekly
routine
of
classes
,
yet
I
have
the
hope
to
keep
trying
unlike
in
past
years
.
And
I’m
confident
I
wouldn’t
have
that
hope
if
I
didn’t
come
back
to
Duke
.
If
you
had
asked
me
one
week
ago
if
I
was
excited
about
coming
back
to
Duke
,
I
would
have
told
you
I
still
didn’t
plan
on
coming
back
I
was
clinging
to
fantasies
of
job
acceptances
like
they
were
winning
lottery
tickets
.
This
whole
time
I
thought
getting
away
would
solve
my
problems
;
but
rather
,
it
would
probably
only
push
them
off
just
like
all
my
other
coping
mechanisms
.
I
seriously
doubted
my
ability
to
succeed
if
I
didn’t
take
a
gap
year
,
but
as
soon
as
I
got
to
my
dorm
room
,
I
felt
surprisingly
ready
to
take
on
junior
year
.
Now
I
can
let
myself
find
the
Duke
I
know
again
before
I
let
it
slip
away
.
By
now
,
you’ve
spent
O
week
and
probably
most
of
the
summer
being
told
how
special
you
are
;
how
lucky
you
are
to
reside
in
such
a
beautiful
Gothic
campus
!
Countless
people
have
given
you
unsolicited
advice
on
making
the
most
of
your
80k
tuition
,
as
you
spend
hours
fretting
over
picking
majors
,
clubs
,
and
dorm
essentials
.
Although
you’ve
studied
the
campus
map
,
somehow
the
buildings
all
blend
together
when
you
stroll
down
main
quad
.
Here
are
some
things
you
may
have
experienced
already
back
pain
from
that
flimsy
twin
mattress
.
Attempting
to
shower
while
the
girl
in
the
next
stall
is
puking
her
guts
out
.
Trying
to
distinguish
between
Social
Sciences
and
Social
Psychology
.
And
yet
for
some
ungodly
reason
,
everyone
keeps
repeating
to
you
,
at
least
.
If
anything
,
it
would
be
odd
if
you
felt
otherwise
.
that
94
of
college
freshmen
felt
homesick
at
some
point
during
fall
semester
.
I
can
tell
you
that
all
of
my
friends
have
felt
isolated
during
sometime
at
Duke
.
There’s
a
lot
of
pressure
on
this
campus
to
pretend
that
life’s
perfect
isn’t
getting
into
college
supposed
to
be
the
hard
part
?
Facebook
paints
a
rosy
picture
where
everyone
is
spending
Friday
night
drinking
cheap
wine
with
their
hallmates
.
So
when
the
reality
is
laying
alone
in
your
bed
,
you
start
to
wonder
what’s
wrong
with
you
.
But
the
truth
is
that
almost
everyone
feels
the
same
.
It
takes
time
to
grow
into
a
life
at
Duke
.
And
honestly
,
it’ll
probably
take
more
than
the
couple
of
weeks
,
months
,
or
year
that
everyone
around
you
claims
.
Moving
into
Duke
for
the
last
time
,
it
feels
surreal
to
reflect
on
how
much
has
changed
.
Each
semester
has
been
a
minefield
of
navigating
new
relationships
.
Even
the
physical
campus
has
expanded
during
my
time
here
.
I
watched
West
Union
open
four
years
ago
.
Since
then
,
the
start
of
each
school
year
has
been
marked
with
construction
the
Ruby
,
Hollows
,
and
now
the
renovation
of
Pitchforks
.
Part
of
the
Duke
experience
has
been
finding
the
spots
that
are
special
to
me
.
Walking
down
Chapel
Drive
during
the
fall
,
when
the
leaves
are
changing
colors
into
red
orange
and
yellow
.
Taking
a
nap
on
a
bench
under
a
cherry
blossom
tree
by
the
red
bridge
.
Reading
on
the
third
floor
of
Rubenstein
.

Duke
is
home
,
because
Duke
is
where
I’ve
created
three
years
of
memories
.
The
first
fall
semester
in
Southgate
with
my
FOCUS
.
Joining
an
SLG
.
Taking
a
semester
off
via
Duke
in
New
York
.
Conducting
research
.
Spending
a
summer
in
Florida
.
Working
at
a
bank
.
Living
in
the
Bay
Area
.
Dropping
and
re
adding
my
Economics
major
four
times
.
Pivoting
into
software
engineering
.
Planning
out
your
Duke
career
is
likely
an
exercise
in
futility
luckily
,
it’s
the
adventures
along
the
way
that
have
made
this
place
so
special
.
Even
as
full
time
recruiting
looms
ahead
,
I
am
still
unsure
as
to
what
I
want
to
do
.
But
that’s
okay
;
the
one
thing
that
Duke
can
be
relied
upon
to
supply
is
constant
change
,
and
learning
to
embrace
that
has
been
the
most
important
lesson
.
I
thought
that
Duke
is
where
I
would
keep
ticking
off
check
boxes
.
Instead
,
Duke
is
where
I’ve
felt
love
,
rage
,
insecurity
,
happiness
,
anxiety
,
and
a
whole
range
of
emotions
that
I
didn’t
even
know
existed
.
Duke
is
filled
with
pockets
of
silence
where
I
can
find
peace
and
places
of
expression
where
I
can
be
free
.
Duke
is
home
,
because
I’ve
built
a
life
here
it
will
take
a
lot
more
time
,
but
one
day
I
hope
that
it
will
be
for
you
too
.
Last
year
,
my
friends
and
I
decided
to
shift
our
annual
beach
week
from
Myrtle
Beach
in
South
Carolina
to
the
Outer
Banks
of
North
Carolina
.
Our
2018
visit
to
charming
Dirty
Myrtle
included
vicious
sunburns
,
several
parking
ticket
crises
and
more
than
enough
awkward
encounters
with
people
we
wished
we
could
forget
at
Ye
Olde
Spanish
Galleon
.
nbsp
;
With
these
happy
memories
fresh
in
our
minds
,
we
instead
planned
for
a
week
of
frisbee
on
the
beach
,
lighthouse
scouting
along
the
coast
,
and
the
occasional
Mike’s
hard
lemonade
in
the
sun
.
One
night
,
with
creativity
hindered
only
by
our
very
limited
supply
of
ingredients
,
a
new
to
us
beverage
was
born
.
Of
course
we
weren’t
actually
the
first
to
invent
this
drink
,
but
we
christened
it
the
Kitty
Hawk
mule
nevertheless
the
cheap
but
fun
!
goddaughter
of
the
classic
Moscow
mule
.
In
my
opinion
,
the
Moscow
mule
is
one
of
the
world’s
best
drinks
.
It’s
the
perfect
blend
of
sweet
,
spicy
and
herbal
.
The
sharpness
of
the
ginger
beer
and
the
bite
of
the
vodka
are
perfectly
balanced
by
the
coolness
of
the
lime
and
ice
,
while
the
name
and
the
traditional
beaten
copper
cup
make
it
feel
worldly
and
sophisticated
.
Plus
,
the
ginger
undoubtedly
boosts
your
immune
system
it’s
a
win
win
win
.
My
parents
got
on
a
strong
Moscow
mule
kick
a
few
years
ago
.
We
don’t
own
any
of
those
copper
mugs
,
but
we
do
usually
have
a
lime
and
a
couple
of
bright
green
bottles
of
ginger
beer
rattling
around
in
the
fridge
.
In
the
summertime
,
we
can
pick
fresh
mint
from
the
plants
that
are
perpetually
sprawling
over
the
rest
of
the
patio
somehow
,
there’s
always
enough
of
the
right
ingredients
to
make
it
work
.
But
the
first
time
I
tried
a
Moscow
mule
was
in
a
friend’s
dorm
room
at
Tufts
.
She
was
throwing
a
Christmas
party
,
and
I
spontaneously
drove
from
Vermont
to
Boston
to
join
the
fun
,
arriving
just
before
a
storm
that
blanketed
the
city
in
an
enchanting
,
festive
layer
of
snow
.
We
all
packed
inside
her
dorm
room
,
roasting
in
holiday
sweaters
and
talking
loudly
over
Spotify’s
Hipster
Christmas
playlist
.
nbsp
;
My
friend
is
lovely
,
and
so
are
her
friends
,
but
in
a
room
of
mostly
strangers
I
still
felt
a
little
out
of
place
.
Someone
poured
me
a
drink
,
and
maybe
it
was
more
vodka
than
any
professional
bartender
could
be
convinced
to
serve
,
and
maybe
we
had
to
ration
the
ice
so
it
wasn’t
particularly
frosty
,
and
maybe
I
drank
it
mostly
to
avoid
small
talk
.
But
it
was
still
delightful
.
It
simultaneously
tasted
like
warm
holiday
spice
cookies
and
transported
me
from
the
crowded
party
to
the
streets
outside
,
luminous
with
moonlight
and
falling
snow
.
I’ve
never
been
to
Moscow
,
but
I’m
fairly
sure
that
Italian
bartenders
can
mix
this
drink
just
as
well
as
their
Russian
counterparts
,
and
certainly
better
than
a
college
student
in
a
Boston
dorm
room
.
While
studying
abroad
in
Rome
,
my
new
friends
and
I
quickly
found
our
favorite
places
laidback
wine
bars
along
the
cobblestones
and
laundry
lines
of
Trastevere
;
quirky
cocktail
spots
near
the
Pantheon
;
dive
bars
playing
both
American
music
and
Italian
soccer
games
.
For
me
,
our
weekend
nights
nearly
always
included
a
Moscow
mule
.
At
only
5
a
mug
,
it
was
an
easy
drink
to
order
a
round
of
,
and
it’s
important
to
note
that
one
of
our
friends
has
the
last
name
of
Mulé
,
a
pun
that
never
went
unmentioned
or
unappreciated
.
nbsp
;
During
that
semester
I
learned
that
Moscow
mules
don’t
necessarily
have
to
be
Russian
.
If
it’s
made
with
gin
,
it’s
a
London
mule
;
with
rum
,
a
Jamaican
mule
;
with
Tequila
,
a
Mexican
mule
.
The
name
changes
with
the
ingredients
,
as
does
the
flavor
and
the
overall
experience
of
the
drink
.
Which
takes
us
to
2019
Beach
Week
,
and
a
new
kind
of
mule
.
Admittedly
,
the
Kitty
Hawk
mule
is
essentially
a
Moscow
mule
,
with
one
key
difference
swapping
ginger
ale
for
the
ginger
beer
.
Using
ginger
ale
instead
of
beer
reduces
the
biting
heat
of
the
drink
,
creating
a
sweeter
,
simpler
flavor
that
is
incredibly
easy
to
drink
and
simply
delectable
after
a
day
in
the
sun
.
It’s
also
cheaper
and
far
easier
to
make
you
can
get
limes
at
the
campus
store
and
a
whole
two
liter
bottle
of
ginger
ale
is
only
0
.
99
with
your
Harris
Teeter
card
.
Pop
in
a
handful
of
ice
cubes
,
a
good
splash
of
Smirnoff
or
Svedka
or
whatever
you
have
handy
,
a
generous
squeeze
of
lime
,
and
fill
it
the
rest
of
the
way
with
generic
brand
ginger
ale
.
Nothing
like
it
.
The
Kitty
Hawk
mule
is
maybe
not
particularly
sophisticated
,
or
complicated
,
or
classy
.
It’s
cheap
,
and
goes
down
easy
,
and
my
mom
would
say
it
will
rot
my
teeth
out
.
But
it
was
the
drink
of
the
week
,
and
developing
it
made
me
feel
like
a
criminal
mastermind
.
In
my
experience
at
Duke
,
it
is
rare
to
feel
like
I
have
done
something
first
or
best
when
everyone
else
is
also
the
first
and
the
best
in
a
thousand
different
activities
and
endeavors
.
For
me
,
the
absurd
rush
of
success
that
came
from
mixing
a
new
ish
drink
is
almost
unparalleled
in
my
academic
and
professional
career
,
and
as
silly
as
it
is
,
I
have
to
say
it
felt
good
to
make
something
new
.
nbsp
;
It’s
still
FWOC
and
senior
year
is
already
hurtling
past
me
,
faster
every
day
,
and
I
am
going
to
be
chasing
that
feeling
.
I
want
this
giddy
innovation
to
carry
me
through
the
next
two
semesters
,
my
last
chance
to
live
any
part
of
the
Duke
experience
at
least
for
now
.
I
want
more
ludicrous
successes
,
more
feeling
like
I’m
doing
it
right
,
more
blissful
days
away
from
it
all
,
more
nights
with
my
friends
laughing
over
ridiculous
wins
.
I
want
more
Kitty
Hawk
mules
.
There
are
few
things
I
hate
more
than
the
sight
of
flip
flops
,
or
any
open
toed
shoes
for
that
matter
,
worn
on
a
male
foot
.
Male
feet
are
just
gross
.
Mine
personally
have
wiry
hairs
shooting
out
the
top
of
each
toe
,
crowned
with
haphazardly
trimmed
toenails
which
crescendo
into
a
pinky
toenail
that’s
become
such
a
lost
cause
that
I’ve
resorted
to
just
kinda
filing
down
once
every
blue
moon
so
that
it
doesn’t
rip
holes
in
my
socks
.
Even
if
you’re
one
of
the
chosen
few
with
hairless
feet
that
you
attentively
and
frequently
groom
,
chances
are
your
male
foot
is
still
gross
just
by
the
nature
of
it
being
a
male
foot
.
Fashion
designer
and
filmmaker
Tom
Ford
put
it
best
in
a
February
2017
interview
with
Entertainment
Weekly
I
wouldn’t
be
caught
dead
in
flip
flops
.
I
hate
flip
flops
on
men
.
Unless
you
have
the
world’s
most
perfect
feet
,
and
then
only
at
a
beach
resort
,
never
in
the
city
.
This
trend
of
men
in
flip
flops
in
a
city
drives
me
crazy
or
on
a
plane
when
you’re
on
a
plane
and
someone
gets
on
in
flip
flops
,
it’s
very
strange
.
I
don’t
know
how
they
feel
secure
enough
,
I
couldn’t
cope
with
it
.
I
would
argue
that
first
and
foremost
the
function
of
a
male
shoe
is
not
to
provide
support
or
protection
,
but
instead
to
spare
friends
and
strangers
alike
from
constant
exposure
to
the
deformed
monstrosities
encased
inside
.
That’s
what
makes
open
toed
shoes
so
egregious
.
Instead
of
hiding
the
foot
they
frame
it
and
present
it
for
the
whole
world
to
see
.
A
bare
foot
,
for
instance
,
in
an
appropriate
setting
like
a
pool
or
inside
a
house
rarely
gets
noticed
because
our
brains
tune
out
the
expected
.
Shoes
,
however
,
are
one
of
the
first
things
catch
our
eyes
when
we
interact
with
someone
in
an
unfamiliar
setting
.
A
pair
of
flip
flops
,
then
,
are
essentially
clickbait
tricking
innocent
eyes
into
having
to
look
at
gross
feet
.
On
Duke’s
campus
,
90
percent
of
guys
dress
either
like
old
men
or
middle
schoolers
.
The
old
men
might
wear
something
like
khakis
with
a
horizontal
stripped
polo
,
usually
poorly
paired
with
some
random
athletic
shoe
.
The
middle
schoolers
wear
almost
exclusively
shorts
in
tandem
with
white
high
socks
and
some
overly
busy
graphic
tee
.
But
even
these
tragic
cases
are
miles
better
than
any
other
variety
of
flip
flop
wearer
.
That
being
said
,
there
are
also
two
types
of
flip
flop
wearers
,
each
exceptionally
worse
than
the
base
model
.
The
first
is
the
flip
flops
plus
gym
shorts
with
lanyard
keychain
peeking
out
one
pocket
breed
.
If
that
lanyard
isn’t
around
your
neck
then
you
don’t
need
it
,
it’s
as
simple
as
that
.
The
second
are
those
who
wear
flip
flops
with
jeans
.
I
feel
no
need
to
explain
further
why
this
is
not
only
an
affront
to
all
things
fashion
but
also
basic
human
dignity
.
And
before
you
say
it
,
I
don’t
buy
any
type
of
but
it’s
convenient
argument
.
It
takes
twenty
seconds
max
to
put
on
normal
shoes
and
if
you
really
have
an
aversion
to
socks
you
can
invest
in
a
pair
of
espadrilles
or
something
.
Flip
flops
are
also
just
uncomfortable
and
useless
shoes
that
prevent
you
from
participating
in
a
number
of
essential
daily
activities
.
Good
luck
chasing
down
the
C1
in
your
flat
pieces
of
rubber
attached
to
a
plastic
wishbone
.
But
functionality
aside
,
what
it
really
comes
down
to
is
respect
.
Respect
to
those
you
interact
with
in
the
outside
world
and
who
willingly
choose
to
spend
their
precious
time
with
you
.
The
least
you
can
do
is
not
selfishly
subject
them
to
your
poor
life
choices
.
If
you
find
some
sort
of
commune
of
flip
flop
wearers
who
collectively
opt
in
to
the
madness
,
then
be
my
guest
to
make
that
mistake
together
.
But
in
the
company
of
upstanding
members
of
society
,
please
refrain
.
I’d
like
to
end
by
saying
to
those
who
currently
or
in
the
past
have
dabbled
in
the
footwear
dark
side
,
I
forgive
you
.
There
was
a
time
that
I
too
sported
the
Adidas
slide
in
any
and
all
informal
settings
.
We
are
raised
not
knowing
any
better
and
easily
get
trapped
in
an
echo
chamber
that
prevents
us
from
seeing
the
error
in
our
ways
.
I
do
,
however
,
implore
you
to
do
better
.
To
better
yourself
and
help
in
bettering
those
around
you
.
This
starts
of
course
starts
with
purging
your
own
closet
of
open
toed
shoes
,
but
also
means
taking
initiative
by
pointing
and
yelling
what
are
those
?
?
any
time
you
see
a
flip
flop
out
in
the
wild
.
It’s
not
a
refreshing
take
to
say
that
politics
,
particularly
in
the
United
States
,
have
become
incredibly
polarizing
and
personal
.
The
very
thought
of
bargaining
and
compromising
with
those
from
across
the
aisle
is
often
seen
as
indicative
of
a
lack
of
principle
or
poor
moral
character
.
For
these
reasons
I
can
understand
why
it
may
appear
intuitive
in
this
political
climate
to
believe
that
the
truth
lies
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
more
radical
views
and
that
only
through
a
balancing
act
of
both
give
and
take
can
politicians
arrive
at
pragmatic
and
beneficial
outcomes
.
This
sort
of
analysis
,
however
,
is
easy
for
Centrist
Chads
many
of
whom
are
here
at
Duke
precisely
because
it
is
a
cop
out
.
Centrism
,
bridging
the
divide
,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
isn’t
innovative
or
intelligent
;
it’s
an
erroneous
and
shorthand
solution
to
complex
critical
judgments
and
commitments
about
the
political
.
I
know
that
there
are
people
who
are
simply
moderate
because
of
conflicting
interests
and
well
intentioned
indecisiveness
.
However
,
I
do
think
that
many
centrists
adopt
their
political
affiliation
as
a
result
of
privilege
and
general
political
apathy
.
I
think
that
the
biggest
reason
why
many
people
identify
as
a
moderate
is
that
they
are
personally
uncomfortable
or
simply
don’t
care
enough
to
interrogate
their
own
beliefs
to
make
difficult
judgments
.
I
don’t
believe
it’s
realistic
to
expect
or
mandate
all
people
to
actively
participate
in
politics
or
even
to
inform
themselves
,
but
it’s
undeniable
that
anyone
remotely
affected
by
the
political
has
at
least
formulated
some
stances
about
the
existing
political
structures
and
regimes
.
It
takes
a
certain
level
of
socioeconomic
standing
to
be
able
to
evaluate
the
existing
political
conflict
,
the
tangible
and
material
consequences
of
poor
policy
decisions
and
still
believe
that
both
sides
are
really
bad
or
I
just
don’t
really
think
about
politics
.
For
these
people
,
the
moderate
view
is
appealing
in
debates
and
conversations
because
the
term
rarely
forces
one
to
commit
to
defending
specific
policies
or
beliefs
about
concepts
like
state
power
or
inequality
,
especially
when
one
is
ill
informed
.
The
moderate
view
is
trendy
and
simultaneously
illusory
;
it
allows
the
participant
to
constantly
shift
between
particular
stances
based
on
where
the
conversation
goes
or
what
currently
seems
more
appealing
without
consideration
to
internal
consistency
or
guiding
principles
.
Oftentimes
the
result
is
an
incoherent
conglomeration
of
news
channel
talking
points
;
the
most
prominent
example
is
probably
the
socially
liberal
,
but
fiscally
conservative
type
.
Although
this
topic
has
been
widely
explored
amongst
college
aged
adults
,
I
still
think
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
dangers
of
moderation
.
For
instance
,
these
types
are
fine
accepting
popular
and
widely
held
soft
left
social
stances
such
as
the
existence
of
racism
and
discrimination
but
are
then
unwilling
to
extend
the
identical
warrant
of
empathy
to
economic
policy
in
terms
of
government
intervention
in
response
to
a
history
of
racial
discrimination
or
even
cross
apply
core
values
like
compassion
to
the
status
of
underpaid
and
exploited
workers
.
In
fact
,
I
think
that
centrists
often
make
fallacious
political
judgments
because
they
begin
with
the
assumption
that
moderation
is
an
objective
good
and
that
seeking
the
middle
ground
is
effective
praxis
.
Many
believe
that
centrism
is
an
enlightened
or
more
rational
political
ideology
because
of
the
unique
faculty
of
being
able
to
understand
and
work
with
the
other
side
.
I’ll
certainly
concede
that
understanding
the
experiences
,
values
and
arguments
behind
one’s
political
opponent
is
useful
for
interpersonal
relationships
and
navigating
politics
but
will
contend
that
such
a
faculty
not
only
presupposes
the
importance
of
compromise
but
is
also
insufficient
for
advancing
a
convincing
argument
or
coherent
political
ideology
.
Moreover
,
moderate
politicians
,
at
least
today
,
pride
themselves
on
being
able
to
survey
a
wide
array
of
opinions
and
private
interests
to
ultimately
devise
policy
that
hopefully
makes
some
universally
accepted
improvements
.
Here
it’s
obvious
that
the
consequences
of
the
western
political
system
conflate
empirical
considerations
with
deductive
validity
.
The
middle
ground
between
a
truth
and
a
lie
is
still
false
;
just
because
particular
compromises
may
bring
about
beneficial
outcomes
does
not
suggest
in
the
slightest
that
moderation
is
necessarily
correct
.
We
should
always
seek
to
at
least
at
first
uncover
the
absolute
truth
.
Even
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
centrist’s
logic
of
seeking
to
be
more
correct
than
not
,
on
almost
all
salient
political
issues
it
would
seem
natural
to
make
certain
judgments
about
the
differing
opinions
and
then
to
conclude
that
one
side
might
be
less
wrong
.
For
many
issues
,
such
as
Israel
or
climate
change
,
the
middle
ground
seems
to
be
incoherent
,
even
further
from
the
truth
and
infuriating
for
the
advocates
of
opposite
sides
overly
reductionist
applications
of
moderation
as
a
solution
to
conflict
have
historically
resulted
in
unacceptable
conclusions
such
as
with
the
Three
Fifths
Compromise
.
Realistically
speaking
,
understanding
that
both
sides
have
faults
is
not
sufficient
to
believe
that
all
ideology
is
foolish
or
that
opposite
opinions
can
be
equally
valid
.
Others
argue
that
certain
political
realities
such
as
divided
government
or
the
influence
of
corporations
may
necessitate
compromise
,
but
it’s
easy
to
draw
a
distinction
between
truly
believing
that
the
ideal
political
reality
exists
in
center
versus
fully
considering
the
optics
of
particular
rhetoric
or
policy
stances
;
centrism
concedes
the
inevitability
of
imperfect
,
moderate
actions
while
the
latter
focuses
on
devising
strategies
by
which
politicians
can
pass
legislation
that
brings
us
closer
to
specific
ideological
stances
.
Moderation
is
easy
to
defend
because
it’s
obvious
why
people
might
feel
this
and
that
way
on
certain
issues
,
but
a
deeper
dive
easily
exposes
the
prominent
internal
inconsistencies
in
certain
moderate
beliefs
.
I
think
that
it
is
possible
to
be
well
informed
about
politics
,
hold
oneself
to
consistent
principles
,
and
ultimately
end
up
as
a
political
moderate
.
I
have
no
qualms
with
this
situation
,
but
I
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
majority
or
even
many
self
identifying
centrists
fit
this
particular
mold
.
All
I’m
asking
is
for
Centrists
Chads
to
critically
examine
their
own
political
stances
and
to
minimally
seek
consistency
.

Recently
,
the
Duke
LGBTQ
Network
shared
an
open
letter
expressing
concern
and
requesting
action
on
the
2019
Chick
fil
A
Kickoff
Game
between
Duke
and
Alabama
.
As
an
institution
that
prides
itself
on
its
diversity
and
inclusion
,
we
,
as
representatives
for
the
undergraduate
student
body
,
find
it
disappointing
that
Athletics
would
sign
on
to
a
game
supported
by
an
organization
that
has
publicly
expressed
its
disdain
for
the
LGBTQ
community
.
Athletics’
business
agreement
with
Chick
fil
A
is
in
conflict
with
Duke’s
present
commitment
to
continue
support
for
the
queer
community
.
In
an
era
of
growing
homophobia
,
misogyny
,
anti
Semitism
,
racism
and
xenophobia
,
as
evidenced
by
recent
events
on
campus
,
the
university
should
not
prioritize
relationships
with
hurtful
businesses
over
its
marginalized
students
.
Chick
fil
A’s
anti
LGBTQ
sentiments
are
well
documented
.
For
years
,
the
organization
has
donated
millions
of
dollars
to
groups
that
oppose
LGBTQ
rights
,
such
as
groups
that
oppose
same
sex
marriage
and
promote
conversion
therapy
as
a
cure
for
same
sex
attraction
evidence
shows
that
this
does
not
work
and
can
in
fact
be
deletrious
.
Chick
fil
A’s
current
CEO
has
remained
obstinate
in
spite
of
criticism
,
and
the
head
of
their
charitable
branch
has
referred
to
the
company’s
espousal
of
anti
LGBTQ
organizations
as
a
higher
calling
.
The
corporation
has
also
been
implicated
in
scandals
affecting
other
marginalized
communities
,
including
a
lawsuit
regarding
Islamophobic
actions
.
It’s
disheartening
to
learn
that
,
according
to
the
Duke
LGBTQ
Network
,
Athletics’
only
response
was
a
justification
that
the
contract
was
signed
three
years
ago
.
This
is
not
an
excuse
;
Chick
fil
A’s
attitudes
against
the
queer
community
have
been
known
well
before
that
time
.
The
decision
to
sign
onto
this
game
without
consideration
for
its
implications
on
Duke’s
queer
community
calls
into
question
the
university’s
values
.
We
agree
that
the
game
may
provide
support
to
Duke’s
football
program
and
serve
as
display
of
our
school’s
athletic
prowess
.
And
with
it
quickly
approaching
,
it
is
unlikely
that
Duke
will
renege
on
the
agreement
.
However
,
we
stand
by
the
Duke
LGBTQ
Network
in
our
support
for
the
university
to
acknowledge
its
wrongdoing
and
take
action
to
correct
this
offense
.
Moving
forward
,
we
call
on
administration
to
find
ways
to
mitigate
the
harmful
consequences
of
this
decision
,
inviting
participation
from
queer
students
,
faculty
,
and
staff
.
We
extend
support
to
the
Duke
LGBTQ
Network
,
and
offer
our
support
in
this
process
.
Signed

Boltwood

Upon
returning
from
my
family
trip
to
Cancun
,
I
curled
up
in
my
bed
,
the
slight
grime
of
the
airport
still
sticking
to
my
skin
,
my
body
weary
from
the
day
of
travel
.
Despite
this
,
I
felt
good
,
relaxed
from
the
trip
and
feeling
the
slight
warmth
of
sunburn
for
the
first
time
!
on
my
cheeks
and
shoulders
.
That
is
,
until
I
grabbed
my
computer
and
checked
DukeHub
for
the
first
time
in
over
a
week
.
My
eyes
bugged
out
as
I
focused
on
the
red
notifications
that
alerted
me
to
the
one
of
the
stupidest
mistakes
I
have
ever
made
.
It
was
August
9th
,
and
my
tuition
had
been
due
nine
days
ago
.
Even
more
alarming
than
that
,
there
was
a
500
late
fee
for
not
paying
on
time
.
Now
for
some
of
you
,
this
may
not
be
the
biggest
deal
,
but
,
for
me
,
as
an
incoming
freshman
on
a
new
playing
field
,
a
wave
of
panic
rushed
through
me
and
shook
my
core
,
threatening
to
drown
me
.
I
did
tell
my
parents
,
and
yes
,
they
were
mad
.
But
with
help
from
the
Duke
Bursar
and
a
lot
of
work
on
my
dad’s
part
,
the
late
fee
was
waived
,
and
I
managed
to
not
get
removed
from
college
.
But
unlike
most
of
my
other
blunders
,
this
was
not
going
to
be
overlooked
per
usual
.
Throughout
my
whole
life
,
I
have
always
been
a
scatterbrain
.
When
I
was
young
,
I
would
lose
my
homework
folders
,
toys
,
and
gold
jewelry
my
mom
had
adorned
me
with
in
such
high
hopes
sorry
mom
.
But
as
I
grew
older
,
I
didn’t
grow
out
of
this
habit
;
it
continued
in
other
ways
.
Now
don’t
get
me
wrong
,
I
wasn’t
completely
out
of
it
;
I
never
turned
in
homework
assignments
late
,
and
I
was
on
time
for
work
and
other
extracurriculars
.
But
it
was
still
an
ever
present
issue
.
I
dropped
phones
yes
,
multiple
phones
in
water
,
I
lost
my
wallet
,
I
left
my
keys
in
the
car
;
you
get
the
point
.
And
while
these
might
seem
like
silly
mistakes
that
everyone
makes
,
the
reality
was
that
I
lacked
discipline
.
I
lacked
the
ethic
and
good
habits
that
I
need
to
build
in
order
to
be
one
step
ahead
of
my
responsibilities
,
not
two
steps
behind
.
The
bigger
mistakes
I
make
stem
from
the
smallest
of
things
not
cleaning
my
room
,
not
checking
my
email
,
or
not
putting
my
keys
and
wallet
in
the
same
place
every
day
.
The
repeated
act
of
doing
these
things
doesn’t
only
make
a
habit
;
it
instills
the
conduct
needed
to
be
responsible
with
greater
duties
.
And
honestly
,
I
had
finally
had
enough
of
the
constant
cycle
of
being
fine
for
a
period
of
time
,
followed
by
running
around
like
a
headless
chicken
when
something
easily
preventable
would
inevitably
go
wrong
.
So
,
a
week
before
leaving
for
college
,
I
began
to
change
myself
in
little
ways
.
I
started
making
my
bed
every
day
,
and
I
put
reminders
on
my
phone
to
check
my
email
,
clean
my
room
,
make
my
bed
,
and
charge
my
phone
and
computer
.
I
littered
my
calendar
with
all
the
upcoming
deadlines
with
alerts
for
two
or
three
days
before
.
And
now
,
as
I
am
being
launched
into
a
new
life
at
Duke
,
not
yet
as
the
mature
,
responsible
person
I
am
striving
to
be
,
I
am
trying
to
use
this
as
a
new
opportunity
for
self
growth
.
Of
course
,
I
am
looking
for
an
amazing
education
at
Duke
and
friendships
that
will
last
forever
,
but
I
am
also
seriously
looking
for
the
transition
from
a
reckless
teenager
to
an
actual
,
independent
adult
.
I
am
sure
that
the
combination
of
working
on
it
and
living
independently
,
without
the
safety
net
of
my
parents
or
sisters
in
the
same
house
as
me
,
will
be
able
to
alter
how
I
handle
responsibility
.
I
know
it
might
be
hard
,
and
I
know
there
will
be
more
mistakes
.
However
,
I
am
also
hoping
that
even
having
the
desire
to
change
will
help
me
at
least
a
little
bit
of
the
way
there
.
So
Dear
Duke
,
As
a
freshman
writing
this
on
the
10
hour
road
trip
to
Durham
,
I
hope
you
will
be
able
to
make
me
into
more
of
an
adult
.
Because
being
an
adult
isn’t
about
paying
your
bills
or
scheduling
your
own
doctors’
appointments
.
It’s
about
the
little
things
being
accountable
for
your
belongings
and
being
aware
of
your
responsibilities
at
all
times
.
And
if
being
an
adult
starts
from
cleaning
your
room
every
day
,
I
sure
am
willing
to
try
.
Love
,
Sana
Welcome
to
Duke
!
As
you
settle
in
and
get
used
to
this
new
environment
,
you
may
feel
overwhelmed
.
Luckily
,
your
good
buddy
Monday
Monday
is
here
to
assuage
your
fears
by
providing
some
fool
proof
tips
to
surviving
orientation
week
.
Tip
1
If
you
meet
your
roommate’s
family
while
moving
in
,
be
sure
to
make
a
good
impression
.
Sit
in
the
room
and
do
absolutely
nothing
while
they
unpack
your
roommate’s
bedding
and
furniture
.
Your
utter
uselessness
will
ensure
your
invitation
to
their
beach
house
during
spring
break
.
Tip
2
Attend
all
the
events
.
Literally
all
of
them
.
Including
other
students’
academic
advising
meetings
.
Tip
3
Harass
the
freshman
basketball
players
during
the
class
photo
.
This
may
be
your
only
opportunity
to
interact
with
a
celebrity
in
your
life
.
Tip
4
Prepare
a
fun
fact
.
If
you
prepare
one
fun
fact
,
then
you
will
be
prepared
for
all
possible
ice
breakers
.
Please
note
that
once
you
choose
a
single
fun
fact
,
this
can
be
the
only
fun
thing
about
you
from
now
on
.
Tip
5
Become
best
friends
with
your
RA
.
I’m
fairly
certain
there’s
a
rule
in
the
RA
handbook
that
they
legally
cannot
arrest
you
for
smoking
weed
in
your
room
if
you’re
best
friends
.
Tip
6
Do
not
wear
a
lanyard
!
Do
you
want
to
look
like
a
fool
?
Instead
,
forget
your
DukeCard
and
key
every
time
you
leave
the
room
.
You’re
not
cool
until
you
text
your
beleaguered
roommate
whenever
you
need
to
enter
the
room
.
Tip
7
Keep
your
room
door
open
to
encourage
your
hallmates
to
talk
to
you
.
Becoming
friends
with
your
hallmates
is
a
good
idea
,
because
sometimes
you
need
a
place
to
crash
when
you
forget
your
key
see
tip
6
and
your
roommate
isn’t
back
yet
.
Tip
8
Another
way
to
make
hallmate
friends
is
to
accidentally
enter

Oh
,
I
thought
this
was
my
room
,
you
will
say
.
No
silly
,
they
will
say
,
and
thus
your
friendship
will
blossom
.
You
should
also
perhaps
learn
social
engineering
skills
.
Tip

Attend
a
frat
party
.
This
is
a
good
idea
because
it
is
.
There
is
nothing
more
academic
than
doing
what
you
are
not
supposed
to
do
.
Tip
10
Do
not
skip
the
True
Blue
sessions
.
That’s
it
,
that’s
the
punchline
.
Note
that
orientation
week
is
about
more
than
what
you
should
do
.
It’s
also
about
what
you
shouldn’t
do
!
And
do
not
,
under
any
circumstances
,
take
my
advice
seriously
.
Duke
University
Chapel
houses
one
of
the
finest
pipe
organs
in
the
United
States
.
Built
by
the
legendary
Flentrop
Orgelbouw
of
Zaandam
,
The
Netherlands
,
the
mammoth
instrument
dominates
the
great
arch
separating
the
narthex
and
the
nave
of
the
neo
gothic
building
.
The
Flentrop
is
a
tracker
action
instrument
that
contains
5
,
033
speaking
pipes
controlled
by
four
manual
keyboards
and
pedal
.
It
has
a
flat
head
V8
,
two
four
barrel
carburators
,
solid
valve
lifters
,
short
stack
headers
,
and
a
toploader
four
in
the
floor
transmission
.
I
jest
,
of
course
,
but
it
is
all
to
say
that
the
Duke
Flentrop
is
a
high
fallutin'
piece
of
work
and
a
most
proper
instrument
for
presenting
the
organ
works
of
Johann
Sebastian
Bach
,
the
greatest
composer
for
the
pipe
organ
.
Ever
.
To
that
effect
,
the
Duke
Chapel
Organist
,
Mr
.
Christopher
Jacobson
,
recently
undertook
a
series
of
concerts
entitled
,
my
work
my
writing
was
beautiful
,
if
I
do
say
so
myself
.
The
encounter
brought
to
mind
the
statistics
on
every
freshman
class
admitted
to
Duke
over
the
past
thirty
years
.
Each
class
has
surpassed
its
predecessor
in
terms
of
standardized
scores
,
grade
point
averages
,
and
achievements
outside
the
classroom
.
And
the
percentage
of
applicants
who
are
not
admitted
has
grown
steadily
over
the
years
.
Still
,
the
admissions
office
has
always
found
plenty
of
entitled
credential
builders
with
high
opinions
of
themselves
to
go
around
nicely
.
I
snapped
out
of
my
reverie
in
time
to
look
for
the
line
of
students
I
expected
to
see
waiting
to
get
into
the
Chapel
for
the
organ
concert
.
Since
there
was
always
a
line
for
the
basketball
games
,
I
assumed
there
would
be
plenty
of
students
wanting
the
best
seats
for
the
concert
.
After
all
,
Bach's
compositions
for
the
organ
are
among
the
greatest
works
in
the
history
of
music
.
Opportunities
like
this
are
one
of
the
reasons
students
want
to
come
to
Duke
in
the
first
place
or
at
least
that's
what
they
say
in
their
application
essays
.
But
the
entrance
area
to
the
Chapel
was
uncrowded
,
and
there
were
no
students
in
sight
.
Perhaps
they
were
inside
,
I
thought
,
already
occupying
seats
in
the
acoustical
bosom
of
the
sanctuary
.
Wrong
again
!
Entering
the
Chapel
was
like
walking
into
a
rest
home
.
Wheel
chairs
and
walkers
were
everywhere
,
and
as
we
settled
into
our
seats
we
couldn't
help
but
notice
that
the
young
people
in
attendance
could
be
counted
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
.
I
don't
know
what
the
students
were
doing
that
Sunday
evening
.
Maybe
they
were
studying
for
a
test
;
perhaps
they
were
recovering
from
a
Saturday
debauch
;
or
it
could
have
been
that
they
were
just
dominating
the
hell
out
of
a
paper
.
Whatever
the
case
,
they
missed
a
fine
performance
of
some
of
the
most
magnificent
music
ever
composed
,
played
by
a
member
of
their
community
on
a
great
instrument
of
their
university
.
You
may
say
that
one
sample
doesn't
prove
anything
,
and
you
will
be
right
.
But
go
to
any
classical
music
concert
on
campus
and
count
the
students
there
.
It
won't
take
you
but
a
few
seconds
,
and
the
number
will
include
those
who
are
there
as
part
of
a
course
requirement
.
You
may
also
tell
me
that
all
students
are
not
necessarily
interested
in
classical
music
,
or
classical
art
,
or
poetry
,
or
even
basketball
.
And
you
would
be
right
again
.
However
,
in
a
great
university
that
rightly
prizes
diversity
and
that
purportedly
has
its
pick
over
a
broad
and
crowded
spectrum
of
qualified
students
,
shouldn't
there
be
a
decent
showing
at
events
such
as
the
Bach
concert
?
One
would
surely
tend
to
think
so
.
A
noose
hung
on
a
campus
tree
,
a
Latinx
mural
defaced
,
the
n
word
scrawled
on
the
Mary
Lou
Center
,
a
Swastika
painted
on
the
East
Campus
bridge
,
hateful
words
said
to
a
student
in
a
burka
,
students
being
told
they
shouldn’t
speak
their
native
language
on
campus
.
Each
past
event
has
a
set
of
facts
,
known
and
unknown
,
that
nevertheless
flow
from
a
root
problem
Duke
has
a
prevailing
culture
of
white
supremacy
and
cultural
imperialism
that
must
be
named
if
we
are
to
address
it
together
and
live
into
our
status
as
a
global
university
.
However
,
I
have
come
to
understand
that
most
people
who
are
not
white
understand
white
supremacy
to
be
the
subtle
rules
and
norms
that
privilege
whites
,
to
the
detriment
of
blacks
,
people
of
color
and
anyone
who
cannot
pass
for
white
.
White
supremacy
need
not
be
noisy
,
and
its
essence
is
the
quiet
default
that
white
America
is
the
ideal
,
making
everyone
else
other
who
must
strive
to
belong
.
The
processes
that
make
black
children
more
likely
to
be
suspended
from
school
,
produce
college
educated
black
household
wealth
levels
that
are
similar
to
those
of
high
school
drop
out
whites
,
and
that
have
led
me
to
assume
that
black
male
students
on
Duke’s
campus
must
be
athletes
are
some
examples
of
white
supremacy
at
work
.
Cultural
imperialism
is
related
,
and
assumes
the
English
language
and
white
American
culture
to
be
the
ideal
,
with
other
languages
and
cultures
representing
deviations
from
the
norm
.
Some
quick
definitions
If
you
have
read
this
far
,
are
white
,
and
are
mad
or
think
I
have
lost
my
mind
,
try
and
force
yourself
to
read
her
book
.
Or
let’s
get
a
cup
of
coffee
and
chat
.
I
spent
most
of
my
life
not
having
this
insight
,
but
after
a
season
of
reflection
,
I
believe
that
our
unwillingness
to
name
the
reality
of
white
supremacy
is
a
barrier
to
creating
the
Duke
community
that
we
claim
to
want
.
If
you
want
an
academic
treatment
,
James
B
.
Duke
Professor
of
Sociology
Eduardo
Bonilla
Silva’s
classic
makes
a
strong
case
that
progressives
and
liberals
who
are
intellectually
committed
to
equality
and
oppose
racism
are
blind
to
,
and
thus
perpetuate
white
supremacy
.
Two
personal
examples
to
stimulate
dialogue
I
received
White
privilege’
while
staying
at
the
Ritz
Carlton
hotel
in
Philadelphia
a
few
years
back
when
I
went
out
a
side
door
without
my
key
to
get
a
local
newspaper
dressed
in
what
my
adult
children
call
my
homeless
guy
look
an
old
overcoat
and
tattered
wool
toboggan
.
However
,
I
strode
through
the
main
door
of
the
Ritz
,
confident
that
I
belonged
despite
how
I
was
dressed
.

As
I
read
my
paper
in
the
lobby
,
I
watched
as
a
black
man
elegantly
dressed
in
a
navy
suit
,
red
tie
and
electric
blue
scarf
was
stopped
three
times
as
he
crossed
the
same
lobby
,
each
time
being
asked
,
May
I
help
you
?
He
didn’t
need
help
.
White
supremacy
produced
the
unwritten
rules
that
allowed
me
easy
access
to
a
space
because
I
was
white
,
even
though
I
was
dressed
like
I
didn’t
belong
,
and
made
a
Black
man
who
was
dressed
in
Ritz
style
still
have
to
justify
being
there
.
Two
of
the
three
people
stopping
him
were
people
of
color
,
no
one
in
Klan
robes
was
anywhere
to
be
found
in
the
lobby
,
and
we
were
not
in
the
South
.
Friends
and
colleagues
who
are
black
tell
me
that
being
asked
Can
I
help
you
?
with
a
tone
that
questions
their
existence
in
that
space
,
are
a
common
occurrence
.
I
have
not
had
to
endure
the
racial
stress
of
striving
to
prove
I
belong
across
my
51
years
on
Earth
.
Reflecting
on
this
hotel
experience
triggered
a
memory
from
a
spring
afternoon
in
1986
,
when
I
was
caught
skipping
school
,
just
a
few
weeks
before
I
graduated
from
Goldsboro
High
School
.
I
don’t
recall
the
details
,
but
do
remember
meeting
with
the
principal
,
a
black
man
,
who
ran
a
tight
ship
.
I
was
braced
for
what
was
to
come
,
but
he
asked
me
almost
pleadingly
not
to
put
him
in
a
bad
position
like
that
again
before
I
graduated
,
and
gave
me
no
punishment
at
all
.
A
black
classmate
would
not
have
been
treated
the
same
way
.
Extra
burdens
based
on
race
in
one
direction
and
extra
lenience
bestowed
on
the
white
default
are
a
fundamental
part
of
our
country
and
therefore
,
Duke
University
.
They
don’t
invalidate
the
other
parts
,
but
they
are
real
,
and
they
add
up
.
Whites
do
not
have
to
overcome
race
to
live
into
what
we
achieve
,
while
people
who
cannot
pass
as
White
,
do
.
All
else
being
equal
.
I
know
this
is
bracing
to
read
because
it
was
hard
to
write
,
but
I
do
not
wish
to
offer
judgment
.
nbsp
;
Instead
,
I
offer
my
hand
in
friendship
,
so
that
we
can
begin
a
journey
together
,
out
of
love
for
Duke
.
Dear
first
years
,
You
made
it
!
After
all
of
the
preparation
and
packing
,
you’re
here
on
campus
starting
your
journey
as
a
Blue
Devil
.
I’m
sure
the
past
couple
weeks
have
felt
exciting
,
exhausting
,
and
overwhelming
.
As
you’ll
discover
,
those
feelings
won’t
be
going
away
any
time
soon
.
Neither
will
the
seemingly
endless
number
of
opportunities
.
But
it’s
how
you
take
advantage
of
them
that
really
determines
your
success
at
Duke
.
Right
now
,
you’re
probably
ordering
your
first
textbooks
,
receiving
a
ridiculous
number
of
emails
from
the
activities
fair
,
learning
too
many
new
acronyms
,
and
trying
to
figure
out
who
might
become
your
good
friends
.
It’s
a
lot
to
process
while
just
settling
into
new
place
,
so
I
want
to
share
some
thoughts
that
I
hope
will
help
you
make
it
through
FWOC
First
Week
of
Classes
and
excel
in
the
months
and
years
ahead
.
One
of
the
best
pieces
of
advice
I
got
to
start
my
experience
at
Duke
was
from
my
Academic
Dean
.
She
said
to
approach
Duke
just
as
you
would
a
buffet
.
On
the
Duke
buffet
,
there
are
so
many
tasty
foods
you
can
put
on
your
plate
.
The
trick
is
getting
just
the
right
portion
of
the
best
options
available
.
How
do
you
know
if
a
food
item
will
be
good
?
Sample
it
!
Fortunately
,
Duke
provides
many
opportunities
for
sampling
such
as
the
activities
fair
,
volunteer
fair
,
and
events
hosted
by
organizations
across
campus
.
While
it’s
easy
at
the
start
of
the
year
to
get
involved
,
as
time
goes
on
,
this
may
require
taking
a
bit
of
initiative
.
Often
this
is
as
simple
as
asking
a
friend
who’s
participating
in
something
,
scrolling
through
a
website
,
or
sending
an
email
to
learn
more
.
These
same
strategies
apply
to
your
academics
.
There
are
so
many
classes
being
offered
,
so
start
searching
by
using
DukeHub
,
asking
older
students
,
and
looking
at
Rate
My
Professor
.
If
the
class
looks
interesting
,
take
it
!
Don’t
miss
out
on
following
your
passions
out
of
concern
of
checking
off
the
boxes
of
Trinity
or
Pratt
.
I
promise
you’ll
get
there
eventually
,
but
your
favorite
classes
might
be
the
ones
that
deviate
from
your
expected
path
.
One
of
the
Duke
Buffet’s
greatest
assets
its
amazing
chefs
.
Yes
,
there’s
good
food
in
the
Brodhead
Center
and
Marketplace
.
But
I
really
mean
the
people
who
are
creating
all
of
the
amazing
opportunities
,
specifically
members
of
the
Duke
faculty
.
I
can’t
recommend
enough
getting
to
know
your
professors
.
For
your
classes
,
office
hours
can
be
really
beneficial
to
make
it
through
a
problem
set
or
get
clarity
on
an
assignment
.
But
that’s
just
the
start
.
Taking
a
professor
out
to
lunch
which
you
have
70
for
each
semester
through
a
program
called
Flunch
enables
you
to
learn
about
their
research
while
hearing
their
advice
in
navigating
your
field
of
interest
.
In
my
experience
,
these
connections
have
also
lead
to
enjoying
breakfast
at
Elmo’s
Diner
,
playing
tennis
at
the
Duke
Faculty
Club
,
and
engaging
in
exciting
political
debates
.
Who
knows
what
yours
could
lead
to
?
An
important
lesson
about
the
buffet
is
to
not
worry
about
how
your
plate
compares
to
those
around
you
.
It’s
all
about
charting
your
own
path
at
Duke
.
Comparing
yourself
to
the
effortless
perfection
,
adds
unnecessary
stress
,
something
I
can
guarantee
you
won’t
want
.
Even
though
some
nbsp
;
might
disagree
,
don’t
worry
about
nbsp
;
how
your
plate
looks
on
your
resume
.
It
would
be
like
putting
food
on
your
plate
just
because
it’s
fancy
when
the
taste
isn’t
for
you
;
it’s
not
the
best
use
of
your
plate
space
.
Furthermore
,
if
you
put
too
much
on
your
plate
,
you’ll
leave
some
of
the
food
behind
or
walk
out
with
a
stomach
ache
.
It’s
better
to
find
the
right
balance
.
If
you’re
following
your
passions
,
taking
initiative
,
and
getting
involved
,
you’ll
be
on
the
right
track
for
success
.
It
is
also
important
to
change
up
which
buffet
you’re
eating
at
once
in
a
while
,
literally
.
With
all
that’s
going
on
around
campus
,
it’s
easy
to
get
stuck
in
the
Duke
Bubble
.
However
,
whenever
you
can
break
out
of
it
,
you
will
be
grateful
.
Some
of
my
favorite
things
to
do
in
Durham
are
going
to
the
Farmer’s
Market
,
biking
on
the
American
Tobacco
Trail
,
playing
games
at
Frankie’s
Fun
Park
,
and
seeing
performances
at
DPAC
Durham
Performing
Arts
Center
.
Durham
has
great
food
and
Southern
hospitality
,
so
check
out
the
restaurants
downtown
and
chat
with
some
of
the
local
residents
.
Finally
,
don’t
focus
on
getting
the
check
;
really
enjoy
the
meal
!
In
other
words
,
it’s
not
about
the
destination
,
it’s
about
the
journey
.
Your
Duke
experience
will
be
filled
with
awesome
people
,
tight
knit
communities
,
and
lots
of
exciting
opportunities
.
At
times
,
it
will
be
stressful
and
frustrating
.
You
might
find
that
one
of
the
items
on
your
plate
is
expired
or
you
might
slip
and
drop
your
tray
.
But
,
it’s
all
about
learning
and
growing
as
a
Blue
Devil
,
and
having
fun
along
the
way
.
That’s
why
you’re
here
,
isn’t
it
?
It’s
not
a
refreshing
take
to
say
that
politics
,
particularly
in
the
United
States
,
have
become
incredibly
polarizing
and
personal
.
The
very
thought
of
bargaining
and
compromising
with
those
from
across
the
aisle
is
often
seen
as
indicative
of
a
lack
of
principle
or
poor
moral
character
.
For
these
reasons
I
can
understand
why
it
may
appear
intuitive
in
this
political
climate
to
believe
that
the
truth
lies
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
more
radical
views
and
that
only
through
a
balancing
act
of
both
give
and
take
can
politicians
arrive
at
pragmatic
and
beneficial
outcomes
.
This
sort
of
analysis
,
however
,
is
easy
for
Centrist
Chads
many
of
whom
are
here
at
Duke
precisely
because
it
is
a
cop
out
.
Centrism
,
bridging
the
divide
,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
isn’t
innovative
or
intelligent
;
it’s
an
erroneous
and
shorthand
solution
to
complex
critical
judgments
and
commitments
about
the
political
.
I
know
that
there
are
people
who
are
simply
moderate
because
of
conflicting
interests
and
well
intentioned
indecisiveness
.
However
,
I
do
think
that
many
centrists
adopt
their
political
affiliation
as
a
result
of
privilege
and
general
political
apathy
.
I
think
that
the
biggest
reason
why
many
people
identify
as
a
moderate
is
that
they
are
personally
uncomfortable
or
simply
don’t
care
enough
to
interrogate
their
own
beliefs
to
make
difficult
judgments
.
I
don’t
believe
it’s
realistic
to
expect
or
mandate
all
people
to
actively
participate
in
politics
or
even
to
inform
themselves
,
but
it’s
undeniable
that
anyone
remotely
affected
by
the
political
has
at
least
formulated
some
stances
about
the
existing
political
structures
and
regimes
.
It
takes
a
certain
level
of
socioeconomic
standing
to
be
able
to
evaluate
the
existing
political
conflict
,
the
tangible
and
material
consequences
of
poor
policy
decisions
and
still
believe
that
both
sides
are
really
bad
or
I
just
don’t
really
think
about
politics
.
For
these
people
,
the
moderate
view
is
appealing
in
debates
and
conversations
because
the
term
rarely
forces
one
to
commit
to
defending
specific
policies
or
beliefs
about
concepts
like
state
power
or
inequality
,
especially
when
one
is
ill
informed
.
The
moderate
view
is
trendy
and
simultaneously
illusory
;
it
allows
the
participant
to
constantly
shift
between
particular
stances
based
on
where
the
conversation
goes
or
what
currently
seems
more
appealing
without
consideration
to
internal
consistency
or
guiding
principles
.
Oftentimes
the
result
is
an
incoherent
conglomeration
of
news
channel
talking
points
;
the
most
prominent
example
is
probably
the
socially
liberal
,
but
fiscally
conservative
type
.
Although
this
topic
has
been
widely
explored
amongst
college
aged
adults
,
I
still
think
it
is
an
excellent
example
of
the
dangers
of
moderation
.
For
instance
,
these
types
are
fine
accepting
popular
and
widely
held
soft
left
social
stances
such
as
the
existence
of
racism
and
discrimination
but
are
then
unwilling
to
extend
the
identical
warrant
of
empathy
to
economic
policy
in
terms
of
government
intervention
in
response
to
a
history
of
racial
discrimination
or
even
cross
apply
core
values
like
compassion
to
the
status
of
underpaid
and
exploited
workers
.
In
fact
,
I
think
that
centrists
often
make
fallacious
political
judgments
because
they
begin
with
the
assumption
that
moderation
is
an
objective
good
and
that
seeking
the
middle
ground
is
effective
praxis
.
Many
believe
that
centrism
is
an
enlightened
or
more
rational
political
ideology
because
of
the
unique
faculty
of
being
able
to
understand
and
work
with
the
other
side
.
I’ll
certainly
concede
that
understanding
the
experiences
,
values
and
arguments
behind
one’s
political
opponent
is
useful
for
interpersonal
relationships
and
navigating
politics
but
will
contend
that
such
a
faculty
not
only
presupposes
the
importance
of
compromise
but
is
also
insufficient
for
advancing
a
convincing
argument
or
coherent
political
ideology
.
Moreover
,
moderate
politicians
,
at
least
today
,
pride
themselves
on
being
able
to
survey
a
wide
array
of
opinions
and
private
interests
to
ultimately
devise
policy
that
hopefully
makes
some
universally
accepted
improvements
.
Here
it’s
obvious
that
the
consequences
of
the
western
political
system
conflate
empirical
considerations
with
deductive
validity
.
The
middle
ground
between
a
truth
and
a
lie
is
still
false
;
just
because
particular
compromises
may
bring
about
beneficial
outcomes
does
not
suggest
in
the
slightest
that
moderation
is
necessarily
correct
.
We
should
always
seek
to
at
least
at
first
uncover
the
absolute
truth
.
Even
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
centrist’s
logic
of
seeking
to
be
more
correct
than
not
,
on
almost
all
salient
political
issues
it
would
seem
natural
to
make
certain
judgments
about
the
differing
opinions
and
then
to
conclude
that
one
side
might
be
less
wrong
.
For
many
issues
,
such
as
Israel
or
climate
change
,
the
middle
ground
seems
to
be
incoherent
,
even
further
from
the
truth
and
infuriating
for
the
advocates
of
opposite
sides
overly
reductionist
applications
of
moderation
as
a
solution
to
conflict
have
historically
resulted
in
unacceptable
conclusions
such
as
with
the
Three
Fifths
Compromise
.
Realistically
speaking
,
understanding
that
both
sides
have
faults
is
not
sufficient
to
believe
that
all
ideology
is
foolish
or
that
opposite
opinions
can
be
equally
valid
.
Others
argue
that
certain
political
realities
such
as
divided
government
or
the
influence
of
corporations
may
necessitate
compromise
,
but
it’s
easy
to
draw
a
distinction
between
truly
believing
that
the
ideal
political
reality
exists
in
center
versus
fully
considering
the
optics
of
particular
rhetoric
or
policy
stances
;
centrism
concedes
the
inevitability
of
imperfect
,
moderate
actions
while
the
latter
focuses
on
devising
strategies
by
which
politicians
can
pass
legislation
that
brings
us
closer
to
specific
ideological
stances
.
Moderation
is
easy
to
defend
because
it’s
obvious
why
people
might
feel
this
and
that
way
on
certain
issues
,
but
a
deeper
dive
easily
exposes
the
prominent
internal
inconsistencies
in
certain
moderate
beliefs
.
I
think
that
it
is
possible
to
be
well
informed
about
politics
,
hold
oneself
to
consistent
principles
,
and
ultimately
end
up
as
a
political
moderate
.
I
have
no
qualms
with
this
situation
,
but
I
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
majority
or
even
many
self
identifying
centrists
fit
this
particular
mold
.
All
I’m
asking
is
for
Centrists
Chads
to
critically
examine
their
own
political
stances
and
to
minimally
seek
consistency
.
Stepping
onto
Duke’s
campus
almost
a
week
ago
was
like
stepping
into
the
future
.
Stepping
into
a
new
start
,
a
new
path
forward
.
At
the
same
time
,
I
couldn’t
help
but
pause
and
think
about
the
past
.
Not
just
my
past
,
but
the
past
we
all
share
our
history
.
Who
originally
built
the
Duke
Chapel
?
Who
were
the
first
to
attend
a
service
there
?
Soon
,
these
questions
expanded
into
broader
ideas
.
Ideas
regarding
traditions
and
how
they
are
started
.
Who
creates
traditions
?
But
then
two
questions
came
to
mind
that
instantly
captivated
my
attention
given
their
relevance
to
the
present
day
What
happens
to
traditions
over
time
?
Where
do
they
go
?
For
some
,
this
question
is
irrelevant
.
We
are
living
in
the
here
and
now
;
the
people
of
the
past
will
never
matter
.
But
for
others
,
like
me
,
traditions
carry
a
heavier
weight
.
The
stories
,
lives
,
and
traditions
of
the
past
are
just
as
real
now
as
they
ever
were
.
It’s
a
difficult
time
to
believe
in
tradition
.
Our
world
is
all
about
progress
and
change
freedom
from
the
shackles
of
the
past
.
But
at
what
cost
?
It
is
true
we
are
shackled
by
the
past
.
Sometimes
,
we
are
bound
to
evil
and
arcane
ideas
about
how
people
should
behave
or
how
others
should
be
treated
.
But
modernity
doesn’t
just
throw
off
the
shackles
.
It
is
a
blind
executioner
,
burning
traditions
indiscriminately
.
Do
we
even
know
what
we
are
losing
?
What
does
it
mean
for
religious
rituals
to
be
forgotten
?
Does
it
matter
if
local
traditions
die
out
?
I
have
tried
answering
these
questions
by
searching
for
my
own
traditions
,
my
own
heritage
.
This
is
,
luckily
for
me
,
a
good
time
to
be
a
person
of
South
Asian
descent
in
America
.
There
are
more
of
us
here
than
ever
and
we
are
continuing
to
increase
our
outreach
.
I
was
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
sheer
number
of
Indian
dance
cultural
groups
at
Duke
during
the
Activities
Fair
.
These
groups
bring
out
the
vital
parts
of
identity
community
,
art
,
and
food
.
At
the
same
time
,
where
is
one
supposed
to
go
to
discover
Indian
history
?
Indian
religion
?
These
topics
are
far
more
obscure
than
others
.
They
have
to
be
searched
for
,
dug
out
of
their
hiding
places
.
But
it
isn’t
really
a
search
it’s
more
of
a
hunt
.
Tradition
,
culture
,
history
;
for
whatever
reason
,
these
things
have
been
hidden
away
,
almost
forgotten
.
Even
with
hours
of
time
and
the
resources
of
the
Internet
at
my
disposal
,
rediscovering
my
past
is
difficult
.
At
age
eighteen
,
I’m
still
not
really
certain
what
it
means
to
be
Hindu
.
I’m
also
not
sure
what
it
means
to
be
Indian
.
Those
titles
hold
a
vast
amount
of
subtext
and
history
within
themselves
.
The
same
goes
for
other
identities
.
What
parts
of
my
past
am
I
missing
?
It
was
only
recently
that
I
realized
there
was
an
intangible
obstacle
preventing
me
from
understanding
the
core
of
Hinduism
and
the
essence
of
being
Indian
language
.
To
delve
into
my
religion
and
my
nation
,
I
had
to
uncover
the
ancestral
language
of
India
Sanskrit
.
After
hours
of
research
and
tracking
down
classes
online
,
I
am
several
months
into
my
journey
with
few
results
.
Although
Duke
offers
a
number
of
classical
languages
,
Sanskrit
is
not
among
them
due
to
lack
of
student
interest
.
So
,
I
turned
towards
online
resources
.
Luckily
,
I
found
plenty
of
Internet
resources
guides
,
dictionaries
,
lectures
,
and
practice
sheets
.
Unfortunately
,
however
,
Sanskrit
happens
to
be
a
very
complex
and
esoteric
language
that
does
not
come
easily
to
native
English
speakers
.
Just
my
luck
,
of
course
.
But
that’s
not
fair
of
me
.
Even
if
Sanskrit
is
a
difficult
language
to
learn
,
it
is
not
as
obscure
as
I
thought
.
To
this
day
,
tens
of
thousands
of
people
know
and
speak
Sanskrit
,
it
is
studied
academically
,
and
it
even
has
a
revival
movement
hoping
to
expand
its
usage
.
Sanskrit
may
be
difficult
for
me
to
learn
with
only
Internet
resources
,
but
at
least
those
resources
exist
.
For
many
cultures
,
that
is
not
the
case
.
In
reading
the
Duke
Common
Experience
book
,
,
I
realized
that
for
many
people
,
those
resources
don’t
exist
.
In
some
cases
,
they
can
never
exist
.
By
now
,
hundreds
of
languages
have
gone
extinct
;
hundreds
more
will
go
extinct
soon
.
Each
one
is
another
piece
of
human
history
gone
forever
.
And
for
the
descendants
of
those
languages
,
it
is
a
piece
of
their
tradition
to
never
be
recovered
.
As
a
lover
of
tradition
,
I
can’t
imagine
being
so
irrevocably
cut
off
from
the
past
.
What
did
I
end
up
finding
in
my
hunt
for
tradition
?
Although
I
only
have
English
translations
,
my
Hindu
scripture
has
given
me
wisdom
in
dark
moments
.
Learning
Indian
history
revealed
where
I
belong
in
the
world
.
And
my
own
search
has
given
me
something
special
a
fragment
of
my
traditional
culture
.

The
truth
is
,
I
can’t
regain
all
of
it
;
I
was
born
and
raised
in
a
different
nation
in
a
different
time
with
a
different
language
.
I’ll
never
fully
understand
.
None
of
us
can
fully
understand
the
traditions
of
the
past
.
Luckily
,
we
have
some
of
our
own
traditions
alive
right
now
.
For
me
,
the
best
I
can
do
is
keep
a
little
piece
of
the
past
with
me
just
so
it
doesn’t
get
lost
.
Perhaps
,
if
we
all
worked
to
hold
onto
small
bits
of
tradition
,
we
might
share
them
with
the
future
.
Meet
Jane
,
a
typical
mom
driving
her
boys
to
soccer
practice
,
sporting
a
hundred
bumper
stickers
on
the
back
of
her
Honda
pilot
.
Save
the
Mississippi
Gopher
Frog
.
nbsp
;
My
Other
Car
is
a
Hummer
.
Just
Say
No
to
Drugs
.
Legalize
Pot
NOW
!
You
want
to
be
Jane
,
spewing
miscellaneous
opinions
like
noxious
exhaust
.
Despite
the
validity
and
urgency
of
some
of
her
causes
,
Jane’s
message
is
obscured
by
her
annoying
and
crazed
presentation
.
It’s
a
classic
case
of
less
would
have
been
more
.
Which
brings
me
to
the
question
of
whether
you
should
call
out
your
friend
.
There
are
two
prongs
to
this
ethical
quandary
.
The
first
is
whether
to
draw
your
friend’s
attention
to
his
uneven
application
of
political
correctness
.
The
second
is
whether
to
address
his
inappropriate
reference
to
gun
violence
and
suicide
.
Regarding
the
first
,
the
most
effective
activists
often
have
laser
like
focus
on
a
few
issues
.
This
may
result
in
tunnel
vision
or
inability
to
perceive
anything
beyond
one’s
field
of
interest
.
For
example
,
while
the
environmental
warrior
righteously
tells
store
clerks
that
no
,
he
does
not
want
a
plastic
bag
that
will
eventually
end
up
in
a
whale’s
intestines
,
he
may
not
be
up
to
date
on
his
gender
neutral
pronouns
.
In
turn
,
his
roommate
,
who
makes
liberal
use
of
Xe
,
Xem
,
Xyr
,
may
make
cringe
inducing
comments
about
the
residents
of
fly
over
states
.
Both
are
holier
than
thou
on
certain
topics
but
clueless
on
others
.
Nobody
can
be
everything
to
everyone
,
except
Jane
,
and
you
can
see
how
well
that’s
working
.
Given
the
cross
currents
of
contemporary
social
and
political
movements
,
it
is
almost
inevitable
that
your
friend
will
be
selectively
sensitive
to
causes
that
relate
to
his
own
human
experience
.
At
the
same
time
,
if
your
friend
chooses
to
call
people
out
,
that
triggers
an
obligation
for
him
to
be
extra
vigilant
about
what
he
says
.
By
consistently
confronting
others
,
he
puts
himself
on
a
moral
high
ground
and
raises
the
bar
.
But
he
can’t
raise
the
bar
for
others
without
clearing
it
himself
.
Let’s
turn
to
your
second
option
of
engagement
addressing
the
political
incorrectness
of
his
blow
my
brains
out
comment
.
There
was
a
time
when
such
language
was
unremarkable
.
Some
still
might
argue
that
his
words
are
just
a
harmless
expression
of
frustration
.
But
someone
who
has
been
affected
by
suicide
or
gun
violence
might
not
be
so
blase
.
In
fact
,
she
might
be
deeply
disturbed
.
If
you
are
sufficiently
bothered
by
your
friend’s
language
,
say
something
.
But
it’s
a
personal
decision
.
It
only
sounds
convincing
if
you
feel
good
about
saying
it
.
Calling
someone
out
only
works
if
you
have
the
proper
confidence
,
tone
,
and
relationship
to
call
them
out
.
And
if
you
call
everyone
out
,
then
you’re
like
the
driver
with
twenty
five
bumper
stickers
.
No
one
will
take
it
seriously
.
On
the
other
hand
,
one
cannot
be
too
timid
.
As
Elie
Wiesel
said
,
Silence
encourages
the
tormentor
,
never
the
tormented
.
It
is
cowardly
and
shameful
to
say
nothing
and
turn
away

An

I
remember
release
night
for
Harry
Potter
and
the
Deathly
Hallows
like
people
remember
family
births
and
weddings
.
I
was
seven
and
a
superfan
,
so
my
dad
woke
me
up
at
midnight
to
stand
in
a
line
which
stretched
three
blocks
through
our
sleepy
Dutch
city
.
When
we
reached
it
,
the
bookstore
was
filled
with
synthetic
fog
and
plastic
decorations
,
and
a
Hogwarts
robed
cashier
even
comped
my
copy
because
we
were
tenth
in
line
.
We
made
a
twelve
hour
drive
to
vacation
in
Provence
the
following
day
,
and
I’d
finished
the
book
before
we
parked
the
car
.
At
the
time
,
I
was
most
excited
about
the
free
book
and
chance
to
be
outside
after
bedtime
,
but
in
retrospect
,
it’s
the
voracity
of
my
reading
that
I
marvel
at
.
I’m
more
easily
carsick
now
,
but
even
stationed
in
an
armchair
,
I
don’t
think
I
could
knock
back
those
700
odd
pages
in
one
go
.
Indeed
,
I’ve
recently
found
that
reading
for
long
stretches
,
whether
the
material’s
academic
prose
or
fiction
,
requires
that
I
struggle
constantly
against
distraction
and
the
waning
of
my
mental
energies
.
The
memory
of
my
concentration
feat
now
makes
me
curious
about
attention
spans
how
potent
mine
was
as
a
child
,
how
it’s
since
frayed
,
and
how
I
can
work
on
building
it
back
up
.
The
distractions
are
obvious
.
Like
almost
everyone
I
know
,
I’m
constantly
scrutinizing
my
relationship
to
my
phone
,
laptop
,
and
other
instruments
of
procrastination
.
In
various
bids
to
reduce
addiction
,
I
fiddle
around
with
notification
settings
,
delete
apps
from
my
phone
,
or
switch
displays
to
grayscale
.
But
,
a
computer
scientist
,
social
media
skeptic
,
and
professor
who
churns
out
New
York
Times
bestsellers
on
tech
and
student
life
,
would
dismiss
these
steps
as
coping
mechanisms
missing
the
fundamental
problem
my
failure
to
adopt
a
strict
and
systematically
evaluate
whether
the
technologies
in
my
life
add
value
,
then
eliminate
those
which
don’t
pass
the
test
.
In
an
ideal
world
,
we’d
all
fulfill
Newport’s
regimen
.
For
reasons
including
peer
pressure
and
my
self
destructive
love
of
Twitter
,
my
own
progress
on
his
path
has
remained
slow
,
but
history
tells
us
that
distraction
,
and
attempts
to
combat
it
,
are
fundamental
to
the
human
psyche
the
battle
for
our
attention
spans
predated
,
and
will
certainly
outlast
,
the
technologies
we
presently
enjoy
.
Newport
,
always
preoccupied
with
maximizing
human
productivity
,
has
brought
his
talents
to
bear
on
these
broader
questions
of
creativity
and
concentration
.
His
2016
bestseller
,
whose
title
refers
to
focus
on
a
complex
intellectual
task
,
unpacks
the
requirements
for
intellectual
achievement
without
the
pain
and
procrastination
.
I
find
particularly
helpful
its
suggestions
that
we
zealously
protect
our
deep
work
time
by
scheduling
it
in
advance
,
block
messaging
and
email
during
deep
work
periods
,
and
hold
ourselves
accountable
by
regularly
logging
our
progress
.
Attention
,
he
writes
,
is
a
muscle
literally
just
as
accumulated
myelin
sheaths
enable
us
to
perform
physical
movements
,
so
too
do
they
protect
our
brain’s
generative
processes
which
,
with
careful
training
,
can
grow
stronger
.
I
rarely
meet
his
standards
,
but
I
find
Newport’s
work
an
invaluable
benchmark
.
Central
as
attention
is
to
our
role
as
students
,
though
,
I
think
it
has
even
richer
dividends
to
pay
in
our
relationships
.
The
20th
century
French
philosopher
wrote
that
attention
is
the
rarest
and
purest
form
of
generosity
and
added
elsewhere
that
taken
to
its
highest
degree
,
it
is
the
same
thing
as
prayer
.
It
presupposes
faith
and
love
.
I
can
grant
my
own
fundamentally
limited
faith
and
love
to
a
poem
,
an
equation
,
or
a
children’s
novel
about
a
boy
wizard
,
but
I
can
also
give
it
to
a
parent
,
a
sibling
,
a
friend
in
crisis
.
Here
,
too
,
does
my
distractible
brain
betray
me
;
here
,
even
more
,
do
I
need
to
cultivate
my
focus
and
presence
.
My
goal
for
this
semester
the
gift
I’m
giving
myself
is
the
chance
to
luxuriate
in
both
my
academics
and
my
friendships
without
distraction
or
emotional
absence
.
It’s
a
slow
road
,
full
of
traps
and
doubling
back
on
itself
,
but
it’s
one
,
I
think
,
worth
traveling
.
So
,
you’re
starting
college
.
Congratulations
!
An
old
Chronicle
tradition
dating
back
suggests
that
I
give
you
some
advice
as
you
sit
on
the
precipice
of
your
Duke
career
.
And
because
I’m
self
absorbed
and
hate
breaking
rules
,
I’ll
acquiesce
.
My
DukeHub
profile
says
I’m
a
senior
,
which
means
I
must
have
been
here
three
years
,
though
as
corny
as
it
sounds
I
couldn’t
tell
you
where
they
went
.
I
certainly
feel
more
mature
,
but
I
don’t
feel
much
wiser
or
even
like
a
better
person
.
This
,
though
,
might
make
me
the
perfect
candidate
to
give
advice
,
because
my
advice
is
realistic
.
I
don’t
expect
you
to
stay
on
your
pre
med
track
;
I
haven’t
taken
a
single
science
class
at
Duke
.
I
don’t
expect
you
to
hook
up
with
every
crush
from
a
class
or
a
party
;
I’m
still
dating
my
high
school
boyfriend
.
In
truth
,
I
don’t
expect
you
to
do
anything
other
than
find
your
most
authentic
self
in
these
four
years
And
if
you
fall
short
of
that
,
well
,
you’re
in
good
company
.
All
this
to
say
,
if
you’re
like
me
,
you’re
coming
into
Duke
with
a
million
expectations
.
And
somehow
,
if
you’re
like
me
,
you’ll
meet
them
all
and
miss
them
all
simultaneously
.
There’s
nothing
to
prepare
you
for
the
twists
and
turns
you’re
about
to
face
.
But
,
as
much
as
I
hate
using
this
section
as
a
diary
,
I
figured
I’d
walk
you
through
my
experience
to
give
you
a
better
idea
of
what’s
to
come
.
I
became
a
columnist
for
the
Chronicle
before
I
got
to
campus
,
cause
,
why
not
?
I
moved
in
to
Giles
and
got
sweaty
at
Devine’s
.
I
learned
to
be
scared
of
men
during
O
Week
.
I
ate
so
,
so
many
Marketplace
curly
fries
.
I
turned
in
my
first
graded
essay

I
got
my
first
C
on
my
first
college
essay
.
I
went
to
the
writing
studio
and
got
an
A
on
the
final
draft
of
my
first
college
essay
.
I
tried
to
white
tent
but
didn’t
make
the
cut
.
I
rushed
and
joined
a
sorority
.
I
took
Public
Policy
155
and
was
the
only
person
in
the
history
of
the
world
to
enjoy
it
sorry
,
Sanford
.
I
came
to
class
hungover
and
threw
up
in
the
bathroom
.
Twice
.
I
did
DukeEngage
and
claimed
to
be
one
of
those
people
who
went
in
prepared
and
picked
a
good
one
.
Maybe
,
but
we
should
probably
fix
the
bad
ones
.
I
applied
for
things
and
didn’t
get
them
.
I
applied
for
other
things
and
did
get
them
.
I
lived
on
Central
Campus
a
joy
most
of
you
will
never
experience
and
developed
Seasonal
Affective
Disorder
from
the
lack
of
windows
.
I
became
a
Teaching
Assistant
for
Public
Policy
155
,
and
tried
to
convince
other
people
to
enjoy
it
.
Everyone
tried
to
get
an
appointment
at
CAPS
while
pretending
like
they
didn’t
need
an
appointment
at
CAPS
.
I
became
an
advocate
with
the
Community
Empowerment
Fund
and
saw
Duke
differently
.
I
wondered
if
I
deserved
to
be
somewhere
like
Duke
.
I
joined
an
SLG
and
stopped
going
to
Shooters
so
often
still
love
you
,
Devine’s
.
I
took
a
class
with
Bill
Chafe
and
understood
why
people
went
to
college
.
I
tried
again
to
white
tent
,
but
didn’t
make
the
cut
.
I
became
disillusioned
;
I
saw
pervasive
inequality
everywhere
.
I
joined
a
group
of
progressive
student
activists
.
I
went
to
live
in
Montgomery
,
Alabama
for
the
summer
.
It
was
sweaty
.
I
went
abroad
to
Madrid
,
Spain
and
lived
with
a
host
family
.
I
grew
closer
with
friends
,
new
and
old
.
I
went
to
thirteen
countries
in
planes
and
trains
and
BlaBlaCars
.
I
appreciated
art
and
tried
to
be
more
creative
.
I
started
a
short
story
and
never
finished
it
.
I
lost
things
and
found
things
and
was
stolen
from
and
was
given
to
.
I
dropped
my
sorority
and
still
kept
the
friends
.
I
moved
into
a
house
and
built
a
little
family
there
.
I
lit
more
candles
and
read
more
books
.
I
finally
took
an
English
class
and
loved
it
.
I
tried
to
white
tent
and
didn’t
make
the
cut
,
again
.
My
friend
dropped
out
of
his
white
tent
so
I
took
his
spot
and
spent
three
miserable
nights
in
K
Ville
.
I
watched
Zion
bust
his
shoe
in
the
first
27
seconds
of
the
Carolina
game
.
But
hey
,
Obama
was
there
.
I
resisted
the
urge
to
go
through
consulting
recruitment
.
I
pretended
not
to
judge
my
friends
for
going
through
consulting
recruitment
.
I
became
the
Opinion
Editor
for
the
Chronicle
and
vowed
to
focus
our
contributions
more
on
policy
than
emotion
.
But
alas
,
here
we
are
.
The
point
is
,
this
week
marks
the
beginning
of
a
new
chapter
for
you
.
As
you’re
going
through
it
,
each
moment
feels
all
consumingly
important
,
unbearably
significant
.
Some
of
those
moments
actually
are
.
But
in
hindsight
,
at
least
to
me
,
they
all
add
up
to
a
beautiful
blur
of
lessons
.
I
wish
I
had
known
that
going
in
.
I
encourage
you
to
dive
head
first
into
as
much
as
you
can
with
the
knowledge
that
all
of
the
hard
is
temporary
and
all
of
the
fun
is
temporary
but
all
of
the
growth
is
permanent
and
necessary
.
And
don’t
go
to
class
hungover
.
Tour
guides
are
responsible
for
leading
over
40
,
000
annual
visits
to
this
beautiful
gothic
campus
.
Our
commitment
is
an
hour
and
fifteen
minutes
a
week
,
but
as
a
black
student
on
this
campus
,
it
feels
like
a
lot
more
.
We
start
at
nbsp
;
the
Admissions
Office
and
head
toward
Abele
Quad
.
Parents
and
students
ask
me
questions
along
the
way
.
We
get
to
Abele
Quad
and
I
emphasize
that
Julian
Abele
,
a
black
architect
,
designed
the
picturesque
nbsp
;
campus
nbsp
;
decades
before
he
would
have
even
been
able
to
attend
this
school
.
On
other
stops
I
talk
about
memorable
experiences
,
amazing
professors
,
crazy
traditions
,
and
lifelong
friends
.
Before
long
,
the
tour
is
over
.
Parents
and
students
nbsp
;
clap
and
I
direct
them
back
to
the
admission
office
.
Some
families
linger
waiting
to
ask
me
questions
one
on
one
.
A
white
dad
tells
me
that
he
could
really
tell
my
enthusiasm
for
Duke
.
As
I
thank
him
,
I
see
a
black
family
linger
behind
,
and
I
know
what’s
coming
.
It
happens
every
time
I
have
a
black
family
or
group
on
my
tour
which
is
unfortunately
not
quite
often
.
How
is
Duke
for
that
happen
on
campus
,
with
an
emphasis
on
the
pluralizing
s’
.
There
are
many
times
where
I’m
still
the
only
black
person
in
my
classes
,
something
I
naively
thought
would
go
away
after
high
school
.
I
tell
them
that
the
administration
isn’t
always
the
best
about
things
,
but
the
students
make
the
most
difference
.
Groups
of
students
band
together
when
bad
things
happen
and
are
vocal
about
the
change
,
they
not
only
want
to
see
but
need
to
see
.
There
haven’t
been
that
many
institutional
changes
,
but
the
presence
of
people
,
even
when
it’s
just
a
few
,
standing
up
against
injustices
that
happen
on
our
campus
make
me
feel
more
comfortable
than
an
email
sent
by
the
University
to
keep
its
image
clean
.
I
tell
them
that
Duke
is
trying
kind
of
but
it
still
has
a
long
way
to
go
.
I
weave
my
words
carefully
so
that
I
am
telling
them
the
full
truth
,
but
not
tarnishing
the
image
of
dear
old
Duke
.
One
of
the
first
lines
in
the
tour
guide
manual
is
portray
a
fair
and
unbiased
opinion
on
campus
life
activities
,
but
how
can
I
do
that
when
this
campus
is
biased
against
students
who
look
like
me
?
Students
who
have
only
just
been
able
to
attend
this
University
in
the
past
56
years
58
for
graduate
students
.
I
feel
like
I’m
betraying
black
students
on
my
tours
when
I
tell
them
about
how
great
O
Week
is
,
how
I
was
able
to
go
abroad
for
the
first
time
thanks
to
financial
aid
,
and
how
crazy
the
basketball
games
are
because
I
want
them
to
apply
and
go
here
.
I
want
to
see
more
black
students
on
this
campus
.
The
black
population
at
Duke
went
down
from
13
percent
in
the
Class
of
2021
,
to
10
percent
in
the
Class
of
2022
.
I
don’t
tell
these
prospective
students
nbsp
;
that
the
black
students
of
the
Class
of
2022
were
greeted
with
a
racial
slur
at
the
Mary
Lou
before
classes
even
started
.
I
tell
them
about
some
of
the
engaging
conversations
I’ve
had
in
class
but
leave
out
the
little
things
.
The
microaggressions
.
The
internal
racism
students
are
positive
they
don’t
have
because
they
have
one
black
friend
and
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
.
is
their
favorite
activist
.
Having
to
hear
non
black
people
sing
ALL
the
lyrics
to
Caroline
even
though
Aminé
damn
well
said
if
you
ain’t
black
,
don’t
say
n
a

Having
to
see
a
ThrowbackThursday
picture
of
East
campus
in
the
1960s
when
the
school
was
segregated
by
race
and
gender
posted
on
the
school’s
official
twitter
.
Even
worse
,
having
students
ask
for
it
to
be
taken
down
,
but
having
our
sentiments
ignored
.
Duke
,
you
need
to
do
more
.
The
diversity
and
inclusion
you
brag
about
isn’t
simply
putting
non
white
people
on
brochures
or
the
website
.
It’s
about
actually
doing
something
to
help
those
students
.
It’s
not
about
nostalgizing
your
racist
past
but
finding
a
way
to
grow
from
and
change
its
course
even
if
it
does
upset
a
few
older
alumni
.
Hold
your
students
and
your
staff
accountable
.
Hold
yourself
accountable
.
I’m
going
abroad
in
the
fall
woohoo
,
but
I
don’t
know
if
I
can
go
back
to
giving
tours
in
the
spring
.
It
gives
me
so
much
joy
seeing
students
fall
in
love
with
a
campus
that
I
call
my
home
,
but
at
the
same
time
I
don’t
want
to
lead
others
to
believe
Duke
is
everything
it
claims
to
be
.
I
don’t
think
I
can
effectively
be
a
representative
of
Duke
University
that
the
tour
guide
manual
wants
me
to
be
while
fighting
against
a
University
that
does
not
completely
value
my
place
here
.
To
black
students
thinking
about
applying
to
Duke
,
know
that
you
have
every
right
to
be
here
and
more
.
Know
that
Duke
as
an
institution
might
not
be
fighting
for
you
,
but
there
is
a
community
here
ready
to
help
you
whenever
you
need
it
.
For
the
past
13
years
,
the
Editorial
Board
of
The
Chronicle
has
published
weekly
and
,
for
much
of
that
history
,
daily
columns
reflecting
on
issues
related
to
Duke
and
the
broader
communities
that
the
University
touches
.
Comprised
of
students
and
advised
by
Chronicle
staff
,
the
Board
strived
to
maintain
its
to
enrich
campus
dialogue
by
offering
thoughtful
opinions
on
a
variety
of
issues
;
to
hold
students
,
faculty
and
administrators
publicly
accountable
for
their
statements
and
actions
;
and
to
help
students
sharpen
their
journalistic
and
writing
skills
.
In
the
time
that
we
have
been
members
of
the
Board
,
we
have
felt
a
consistent
pride
in
the
efforts
made
to
uphold
that
mission
.
From
of
Immigration
and
Customs
Enforcement
agents
in
Durham
to
pushing
for
collective
action
on
labor
issues
like
and
the
,
the
Board
has
been
vocal
and
present
in
some
of
the
most
significant
conversations
being
had
on
and
off
campus
.
At
the
same
time
,
this
work
has
not
been
without
difficulty
.
Around
a
decade
ago
,
the
Editorial
Board
transitioned
from
a
body
of
Chronicle
editors
to
one
of
students
independent
of
the
paper
.
This
past
year
,
each
editorial
has
concluded
with
this
disclaimer
This
was
written
by
The
Chronicle’s
Editorial
Board
,
which
is
made
up
of
student
members
from
across
the
University
and
is
independent
of
the
editorial
staff
.
Still
,
it
has
not
always
been
clear
that
the
positions
and
opinions
of
the
Board
are
not
those
of
The
Chronicle
staff
writ
large
.
The
lack
of
clarity
behind
what
it
means
to
be
an
independent
yet
affiliated
body
of
The
Chronicle
while
engaging
with
some
of
the
most
pressing
and
critical
issues
on
campus
led
to
a
series
of
conversations
on
how
to
preserve
the
voice
and
platform
of
the
Board
while
clearly
delineating
the
opinions
and
comments
of
the
Board
from
the
Chronicle
as
a
whole
.
Following
these
and
related
discussions
,
Volume
115
will
beckon
a
new
evolution
of
the
Board
the
Community
Editorial
Board
.
As
incoming
co
chairs
,
instead
of
the
traditional
reflection
on
the
ever
decreasing
acceptance
rate
or
welcome
to
our
newest
Blue
Devils
,
we
would
like
to
reflect
on
the
significance
of
this
change
and
to
outline
our
vision
for
the
Board
moving
forward
.
Traditionally
,
whether
in
large
papers
like
the
New
York
Times
or
college
papers
like
The
Daily
Tar
Heel
,
Editorial
Boards
are
comprised
of
the
paper’s
staff
and
publish
opinion
pieces
that
are
understood
to
represent
the
perspective
of
the
paper
.
The
Board’s
independence
from
The
Chronicle
beginning
in
2006
signaled
a
shift
towards
a
Board
that
remained
under
the
Chronicle
platform
yet
embraced
a
distinct
and
nonrepresentative
voice
,
similar
to
how
opinion
columnists
do
not
necessarily
represent
the
opinions
of
The
Chronicle
staff
but
still
get
published
under
its
platform
.
As
a
further
emphasis
on
the
differentiation
between
the
Chronicle
staff
and
Board
members
,
Board
members
are
explicitly
prohibited
from
writing
or
editing
other
daily
or
weekly
sections
of
The
Chronicle
.
Currently
,
between
10
and
15
voting
members
sit
on
the
Board
where
members
demonstrate
a
breadth
and
depth
of
knowledge
,
experiences
and
perspectives
to
contribute
to
the
Board’s
discussions
on
the
weekly
editorials
.
nbsp
;
Based
on
the
consensus
of
the
board’s
discussion
,
the
unsigned
editorials
are
written
anonymously
by
one
voting
member
and
later
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
Editor
in
Chief
and
Editorial
Page
Editor
as
with
any
other
column
.
As
follows
,
the
Editorial
Board
does
not
and
can
not
speak
for
The
Chronicle
as
a
whole
.
Just
as
the
Board
does
not
intend
to
speak
on
behalf
of
The
Chronicle
,
neither
are
we
attempting
to
represent
the
entire
Duke
community
.
Rather
,
our
weekly
editorials
aim
to
bring
light
to
variable
issues
from
a
critical
,
thoughtful
angle
through
student
voices
in
the
community
that
are
not
typically
found
among
staff
.
With
this
rebranding
and
clarification
,
we
see
an
opportunity
not
only
to
continue
our
mission
of
enriching
dialogue
and
holding
our
campus
accountable
,
but
also
to
expand
the
breadth
of
perspectives
and
issues
included
within
The
Chronicle’s
pages
.
As
new
co
chairs
to
this
new
iteration
of
the
Board
,
we
know
there
is
significant
work
ahead
to
preserve
this
as
a
space
for
such
critical
discourse
,
but
we
remain
optimistic
.
In
this
new
year
,
Duke
is
poised
to
experience
its
own
broad
array
of
changes
,
from
the
transformation
of
Central
Campus
to
the
and
arrival
of
the
newest
first
year
class
.
We’re
hopeful
that
through
each
of
these
turns
and
along
the
twists
that
are
as
of
yet
unknown
,
the
Community
Editorial
Board
will
remain
a
present
,
engaged
participant
.
If
you
would
like
to
take
a
look
at
some
of
our
editorials
from
the
past
few
years
,
take
a
look
and
feel
free
to
shoot
us
an
email
with
any
questions
.
President
Price
and
Dr
.
Kevin
White
,
From
the
moment
in
which
we
breathe
our
first
breath
to
the
hour
in
which
we
sloppily
articulate
our
first
words
to
the
day
in
which
we
cease
to
breathe
and
articulate
,
our
lives
are
recorded
,
replayed
,
reshuffled
through
the
art
of
storytelling
.
We’re
inundated
with
the
ever
present
humdrum
of
our
mere
existence
;
the
only
way
to
distinguish
what
is
from
what
isn’t
lies
in
our
ability
to
tell
the
genuine
,
the
lived
the
felt
.
So
at
Duke
,
in
our
communities
,
within
every
interaction
to
effectively
approach
narratives
,
we
must
expose
the
rarely
communicated
,
emphasize
fluidity
in
our
encounters
,
and
paint
with
nuanced
shades
of
grey
.
The
rarely
told
lies
within
the
cracks
of
our
chiseled
walls
,
the
shadows
unreached
by
our
light
,
the
drawing
out
of
our
vulnerability
.
We
cannot
approach
the
raw
,
painful
,
anti
revisionist
past
without
acknowledging
the
limitations
of
our
understanding
.
In
There
,
There
,
Tommy
Orange
provides
a
basic
background
of
Native
American
genocide
,
assuming
that
we
do
not
know
,
but
that
we
can
be
taught
.
He
writes
,
Thanksgivings
like
these
happened
everywhere
,
whenever
there
were
what
we
have
to
call
'successful
massacres'
5
.
Orange
matter
of
factly
dismantles
glamorized
narratives
surrounding
Thanksgiving
,
generating
a
deeper
understanding
of
America’s
genocidal
history
.
At
Duke
,
we
can
follow
Orange’s
example
by
advocating
for
exponentially
more
Indigenous
Studies
courses
currently
,
our
only
related
class
is
American
Indians
until
1815
and
providing
comprehensive
anti
racism
training
.
In
short
,
Duke
must
take
advantage
of
opportunities
presented
within
higher
education
and
we
,
as
humans
,
must
break
past
the
confines
of
our
peripheral
vision
.
Because
it
is
fermented
in
our
souls
,
in
our
ever
changing
consciousness
,
fluidity
is
a
vital
aspect
of
approaching
stories
.
Orange
approaches
fluidity
through
a
character
,
Dene
Oxedene
,
who
attempts
to
quantify
his
Indigenous
heritage
.
Our
ancestors
fought
to
stay
alive
,
so
some
parts
of
their
blood
went
together
with
another
Nation’s
and
made
children
.
.
.
forget
them
even
as
they
live
on
in
us
150
?
Oxedene
phrases
this
statement
as
if
it
is
a
question
,
one
of
the
immutable
unknown
.
One
thing
is
certain
blood
fluidity
equals
racial
fluidity
equals
human
fluidity
.
Orange
deconstructs
America’s
predisposition
toward
race
,
toward
anti
fluidity
,
all
measured
by
pints
of
blood
and
half
gallons
of
skin
pigmentation
.
We’ve
allowed
no
,
celebrated
a
legal
system
that
once
quantified
Black
people
as
three
fifths
human
.
We
grant
those
incarcerated
who’ve
committed
felonies
humanity
in
census
taking
but
not
in
vote
casting
.
And
so
we
are
hypocritical
determined
to
enumerate
the
intangible
.
No
body
can
be
constructed
with
three
out
of
four
quarts
of
needed
blood
.
The
most
important
aspect
of
approaching
storytelling
,
however
,
is
correctly
analyzing
the
subtle
greys
in
which
the
words
are
illustrated
.
Orange
underscores
this
perspective
A
Cheyenne
word
Veho
.
It
means
spider
and
trickster
and
white
man
169
;
spiders
carry
miles
of
web
in
their
bodies
,
miles
of
story
,
miles
of
potential
home
and
trap
163
.
Orange
manipulates
the
word
spider
spiders
are
equally
story
as
they
are
trickster
;
equally
home
as
they
are
white
man
.
He
asks
if
white
man
equals
home
and
therefore
poses
a
premeditated
question
what
does
home
mean
?
I
challenge
myself
to
approach
narratives
with
a
similar
degree
of
intention
.
I
am
a
white
Jewish
cisgender
woman
;
I
must
constantly
evaluate
myself
and
expand
my
worldview
.
My
home
is
comfortable
;
my
friends
in
Duplin
County
,
North
Carolina
one
hour
driving
distance
from
this
home
are
neighbors
to
the
environmentally
racist
hog
industry
.
The
hog
waste
runoff
following
Hurricane
Florence
prevented
their
homes
from
accessing
potable
water
for
four
months
.
I
fiercely
advocated
for
them
to
speak
at
an
activism
summit
I’d
helped
plan
;
in
that
setting
,
their
voices
were
infinitely
more
important
than
mine
.
I
,
and
we
collectively
,
cannot
merely
approach
new
stories
differently
;
we
must
live
them
differently
.
Veho
means
spider
and
white
man
and
trickster
,
and
spiders
weave
webs
but
they
also
weave
traps
.
And
sometimes
they
weave
both
at
once
.
Approaching
storytelling
to
ensure
a
deep
understanding
of
narratives
is
a
difficult
concept
because
storytelling
,
by
its
own
right
,
is
difficult
.
But
when
one
glances
harder
at
this
three
part
formula
,
perhaps
everything
becomes
a
little
bit
easier
,
because
Veho
means
spider
and
spiders
are
made
of
blood
and
blood
contextualizes
history
.
And
history
is
the
story
of
humankind
.
Duke
Football
takes
the
field
in
Atlanta
on
Saturday
in
its
first
season
opening
game
with
Alabama
since
1972
.
nbsp
;
nbsp
;
In
this
one
,
like
the
'72
game
,
Duke
will
play
before
a
full
house
in
the
Mercedes
Benz
Stadium
against
an
Alabama
team
ranked
No
.
2
nationally
preseason
polls
.
For
all
of
that
,
the
game
stands
for
so
much
more
in
the
lore
of
college
football
and
in
the
Duke
program's
return
to
the
national
stage
under
Coach
David
Cutcliffe
.
That
Duke
would
be
playing
Alabama
now
is
a
story
in
itself
.
nbsp
;
Duke's
fabled
West
Campus
wasn't
even
finished
in
1930
and
Duke
had
yet
to
open
its
stadium
when
then
Dean
E
.
H
.
Wanamaker
approached
Alabama's
then
head
coach
Wallace
Wade
for
advice
on
how
to
nbsp
;
steer
Duke
into
the
same
nbsp
;
national
prominence
in
athletics
that
Duke
was
seeking
in
academics
.
nbsp
;
Wade
,
nbsp
;
nbsp
;
who
was
coming
off
consecutive
Rose
Bowl
appearances
nbsp
;
the
first
by
any
nbsp
;
southern
school
nbsp
;
and
two
national
championships
,
stunned
the
world
by
accepting
an
offer
12
,
500
in
base
salary
plus
a
share
of
the
gate
to
come
to
Duke
as
its
head
football
coach
.
nbsp
;
In
short
order
,
nbsp
;
Duke
would
win
two
national
football
titles
under
Coach
Wade
and
name
its
stadium
after
him
.
What
I
didn't
know
,
as
a
freshman
walk
on
player
in
'72
practicing
for
Duke's
opener
that
season
in
Birmingham
,
was
that
Duke
Football
was
just
beginning
to
compete
again
on
the
national
level
after
years
wallowing
in
obscurity
.
nbsp
;
Duke
went
into
that
game
led
by
second
year
Head
Coach
and
Duke
All
American
Mike
McGee
who
passed
away
last
week
after
a
storied
career
as
a
coach
and
athletic
director
.
nbsp
;
Against
all
odds
,
Duke
was
competitive
against
that
Alabama
team
,
trailing
by
two
at
the
half
and
falling
by
a
respectable
35
12
margin
.
nbsp
;
Our
team
withstood
some
big
hits
as
my
freshman
teammate
and
All
ACC
defensive
end
nbsp
;
Emo
Gilson
was
decked
on
the
opening
kickoff
by
future
NFL
Hall
of
Famer
John
Hannah
grew
from
the
experience
,
and
headed
home
.
nbsp
;
But
nbsp
;
not
before
Alabama
Coach
Bear
Bryant
paid
Duke
Football
the
highest
of
compliments
in
a
post
game
nbsp
;
interview
,
Duke
out
toughed
us
tonight
!
nbsp
;
Remarkably
,
David
Cutcliffe
,
then
an
Alabama
student
nbsp
;
and
later
an
assistant
to
Coach
Bryant
who
would
return
to
Duke
in
a
role
unimaginable
at
the
time
,
nbsp
;
was
in
the
house
for
that
game
.
Duke
Coach
Mike
McGee's
unranked
teams
of
the
1970's
went
on
from
that
epic
meeting
with
Alabama
in
1972
to
play
Tennessee
,
Florida
,
Southern
California
,
and
Michigan
in
successive
seasons
.
nbsp
;
That
willingness
to
schedule
and
compete
with
national
football
powers
proved
to
be
a
run
up
to
Steve
Spurrier's
arrival
at
Duke
as
head
football
coach
in
1986
.
The
legendary
Spurrier
continued
the
restoration
by
leading
Duke
to
a
share
of
the
ACC
Football
title
and
to
national
offensive
yardage
records
in
his
last
season
here
.
So
Saturday's
Kickoff
Game
nbsp
;
between
Duke
and
Alabama
nbsp
;
in
Atlanta
,
historically
reserved
for
the
nation's
highest
ranked
college
teams
,
is
really
a
major
bowl
game
for
Duke
.
nbsp
;
And
it's
a
tribute
of
the
highest
order
to
all
that
has
been
achieved
in
recent
years
by
Duke
Coach
Cut
with
the
support
of
Coach
K
and
Duke
AD
Kevin
White
.
The
Duke
Alabama
game
nbsp
;
really
reopens
the
tale
of
two
schools
that
long
ago
put
college
football
on
the
map
and
put
Duke
athletics
on
the
road
to
compete
at
the
highest
level
.
Duke
University
made
headlines
in
November
2017
for
holding
shares
in
Ferrous
Resources
,
a
company
with
plans
to
build
a
controversial
pipeline
.
For
the
past
six
months
,
reporters
at
The
Chronicle
have
been
working
to
understand
the
rest
of
the
story
.
What
was
the
value
of
those
investments
?
Was
the
University
aware
that
the
mining
company’s
proposed
pipeline
was
projected
to
cause
detrimental
environmental
impacts
for
communities
along
its
path
?
And
what
was
the
deal
with
Ferrous
,
anyway
?
The
2017
annual
meeting
for
Duke’s
Advisory
Committee
on
Investment
Responsibility
,
held
less
than
a
month
after
the
New
York
Times
published
its
investigation
into
dozens
of
universities
whose
investments
surfaced
in
the

Papers

,
said
he
had
only
found
out
about
Duke’s
holdings
in
Ferrous
as
recently
as
meeting
attendees
.
Since
August
,
reporters
Julia
Donheiser
and
Julianna
Rennie
have
sorted
through
hundreds
of
documents
,
working
with
translators
to
parse
Brazilian
court
dockets
and
news
articles
and
interviewing
University
administrators
to
better
understand
the
now
decade
long
relationship
between
Duke
and
Ferrous
.
The
Paradise
Papers
consist
of
13
.
4
million
confidential
documents
about
offshore
investments
,
which
were
leaked
to
journalists
Frederik
Obermaier
and
Bastian
Obermayer
at
the
German
Süddeutsche
Zeitung
.
The
newspaper
shared
the
documents
with
the
International
Consortium
of
Investigative
Journalists
,
which
then
organized
a
global
reporting
collaboration
.
Duke
University
was
among
the
dozens
of
schools
listed
in
the
offshore
law
firm
Appleby’s
client
database
,
which
was
part
of
the
Paradise
Papers
document
leak
.
The
Chronicle
was
granted
access
to
those
documents
in
July
,
and
our
reporters
dug
through
client
lists
and
share
receipts
that
spanned
seven
years
.
We
found
that
Duke
bought
not
only
2
.
1
million
shares
in
Ferrous
in
2008
,
but
also
an
additional
1
.
9
million
shares
in
2015
.
Shareholder
receipts
showed
that
both
of
Duke’s
investment
entities
Gothic
Corporation
and
the
Duke
University
Management
Company
DUMAC
invested
in
Ferrous
.
Client
lists
further
revealed
that
although
Gothic
bought
shares
in
Ferrous
directly
,
DUMAC
acquired
its
holdings
at
first
through
direct
investments
and
then
later
through
Bank
of
New
York
Mellon
,
an
investment
firm
based
in
New
York
City
.
Mellon
was
registered
as
a
shareholder
in
Ferrous
on
behalf
of
Duke
,
which
continued
to
benefit
from
the
investments
.
These
findings
were
confirmed
by
a
tax
attorney
,
who
reviewed
the
source
documents
.
We
also
consulted
Gothic
and
DUMAC’s
tax
returns
and
found
that
he
Internal
Revenue
Service
only
requires
nonprofits
to
list
their
investments
by
the
location
of
a
company’s
headquarters
.
Simply
put
,
Duke’s
investments
in
Ferrous
are
listed
under
Europe
rather
than
South
America
in
DUMAC
and
Gothic’s
990s
.
We
then
reached
out
to
Richard
Schmalbeck
,
Simpson
Thacher
and
Bartlett
Professor
of
Law
,
to
better
understand
the
implications
of
investing
through
blocker
corporations

The
New
York
Times
and
Süddeutsche
Zeitung
reported
that
Ferrous
planned
to
build
a
pipeline
to
transfer
iron
from
its
mines
in
the
Brazilian
state
of
Minas
Gerais
to
the
coastline
.
Our
reporters
dug
into
local
reports
on
protests
against
the
pipeline
,
which
posed
a
potential
threat
to
clean
drinking
water
for
communities
along
its
path
.
In
2012
,
Brazilian
news
outlets
in
Espírito
Santo
the
proposed
endpoint
for
Ferrous’
project
,
where
the
company
planned
to
build
a
iron
processing
plant
and
a
port
for
exporting
refined
materials
reported
that
28
people
had
been
arrested
by
the
federal
police
for
their
alleged
involvement
in
an
land
sale
scheme
supposedly
organized
by
government
officials
.
Ferrous
was
mentioned
in
nbsp
;
the
deal
.
The
company
had
bought
land
along
the
coastline
for
inflated
values
from
companies
owned
by
public
officials
in
exchange
for
tax
incentives
.
The
scheme
diverted
millions
of
reais
from
public
funds
,
the
report
alleges
.
Reporters
at
The
Chronicle
then
used
OCR
software
to
convert
the
police
report
into
a
machine
readable
format
and
translated
it
via
Google
Translate
and
DeepL
.
The
translation
of
all
information
from
the
report
pertaining
to
Ferrous
was
reviewed
by
Magda
Silva
,
senior
lecturer
of
romance
languages
,
and
senior
Bella
Letourneau
,
a
native
Portuguese
speaker
.
The
translation
was
also
cross
checked
with
coverage
of
the
scheme
by
multiple
Brazilian
news
outlets
.
We
also
reached
out
to
several
Brazilian
journalists
and
researchers
who
referred
us
to
the
most
recent
coverage
of
the
trial
.
Seven
years
after
the
initial
arrests
were
made
,
prosecution
of
individuals
allegedly
involved
in
scheme
is
still
ongoing
.
After
months
of
gathering
information
about
Ferrous
and
Duke’s
investments
in
the
company
,
we
contacted
nbsp
;
the
person
who
spearheads
how
Duke
invests
its
endowment
.
Neil
Triplett
,
president
of
both
Gothic
and
DUMAC
,
declined
to
comment
on
The
Chronicle’s
findings
due
to
a
longstanding
University
policy
against
providing
information
about
specific
investments
.
We
also
reached
out
to
Baxter
,
who
declined
to
comment
.
Reporters
then
contacted
Michael
Schoenfeld
,
vice
president
for
public
affairs
and
government
relations
.
After
we
presented
him
with
our
findings
,
he
said
that
Duke
had
invested
a
total
of
10
.
3
million
in
the
company
and
that
its
current
holdings
are
valued
at
approximately
1
million
.

If
you’ve
ever
knelt
down
to
pick
up
a
stray
fortune
cookie
fortune
littered
on
the
ground
,
or
gotten
your
knees
dirty
to
search
for
a
four
leaf
clover
in
the
grass
,
then
you
know
the
feeling
that
I’m
talking
about
.
It’s
the
same
feeling
that
arrives
when
you
look
to
the
sky
for
a
shooting
star
.
This
effort
to
find
meaning
in
the
little
events
of
our
daily
lives
it’s
called
believing
in
magic
.
Magical
thinking
suspends
reality
,
engaging
instead
in
a
kind
of
flawed
thinking
about
cause
and
effect
.
It’s
actually
an
anthropological
term
,
one
which
describes
the
phenomenon
that
if
a
person
hopes
hard
enough
for
something
,
or
engages
in
ritual
actions
with
strong
belief
,
that
the
outcome
of
an
uncontrollable
event
can
be
influenced
.
If
you
plant
magic
beans
,
a
beanstalk
will
grow
outside
your
window
and
you
will
have
riches
beyond
compare
.
If
you
rub
a
Genie’s
lamp
,
three
wishes
will
be
granted
of
your
deepest
desires
.
Young
children
engage
in
this
kind
of
magical
thinking
the
most
.
Think
back
to
your
eight
year
old
fascination
and
all
the
hours
you
spent
inventing
fairy
tales
and
casting
spells
or
curses
with
the
hope
of
influencing
the
events
of
your
ordinary
life
.
Those
were
the
good
old
days
of
Harry
Potter
and
Wizards
of
Waverly
Place
and
Santa
Claus
and
the
Tooth
Fairy
.
But
belief
in
magic
decreases
dramatically
with
increased
age
and
life
experience
.
If
,
as
children
,
we
used
to
believe
in
magic
,
when
did
we
stop
?
Highly
intellectual
environments
such
as
Duke
encourage
their
students
to
act
and
think
rationally
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
.
Chemistry
TAs
won’t
accept
magic’
as
an
answer
for
lab
assignments
,
and
neither
will
English
professors
as
a
way
to
conclude
an
argument
in
an
essay
.
We
are
taught
through
the
education
system
to
be
wary
of
magical
thinking
.
I’d
like
to
think
that
magical
thinking
can
actually
help
us
in
our
daily
lives
.
Magical
thinking
is
a
reaction
to
situations
of
uncertainty
,
where
we
aren’t
able
to
control
the
environment
or
the
outcome
of
a
test
,
game
or
job
interview
.
So
,
instead
,
we
engage
in
an
activity
that
imposes
a
certain
outcome
,
one
that
is
assured
to
be
positive
or
beneficial
.
Magical
thinking
also
shows
up
as
a
means
of
explaining
emotionally
significant
encounters
,
ones
that
seem
not
to
have
other
meanings
.
If
you
look
harder
for
it
,
examples
of
magical
thinking
among
college
students
turn
up
everywhere
.
Athletes
partake
in
the
same
routines
before
every
game
,
fans
wear
the
same
lucky
jerseys
.
Wearing
a
lucky
suit
to
an
interview
,
or
sticking
a
penny
in
the
pocket
before
a
first
date
these
,
too
,
are
examples
of
magical
thinking
.
They
don’t
guarantee
the
outcome
a
job
,
a
relationship
,
an
NCAA
championship
;
but
they
do
have
an
effect
,
according
to
Thomas
Robisheaux
,
professor
of
the
popular
course
on
Magic
,
Religion
,
and
Science’
in
the
History
department
.
Studies
have
shown
that
engaging
in
magical
thinking
,
whether
through
the
form
of
ritual
or
prayer
,
is
effective
because
it
has
an
effect
on
the
psyche
of
the
practitioner
.
There
isn’t
necessarily
any
correlation
between
magical
thinking
and
success
,
Robisheaux
said
.
But
forget
about
whether
magic
alters
the
event
.
If
there
is
an
effect
on
the
person
,
like
calmness
or
confidence
,
meaning
or
purpose
,
it
is
effective
.
By
attempting
to
influence
the
events
of
our
daily
life
through
magical
thinking
,
we
are
changing
our
own
reactions
in
the
process
.
I
asked
almost
every
person
I
encountered
last
week
to
tell
me
where
they
had
experienced
any
magic
,
if
any
.
Their
answers
varied
greatly
,
everything
from
dog
footprints
spotted
in
the
Duke
Gardens
,
to
a
song
that
came
on
at
just
the
right
time
,
to
postcards
unexpectedly
arriving
in
the
mail
from
an
old
friend
.
Snowflakes
started
falling
from
the
sky
the
minute
a
friend
walked
out
of
the
library
at
midnight
.
One
friend
described
the
beginning
of
a
new
romantic
relationship
as
magical
.
Another
told
me
about
reconnecting
with
a
family
member
she
didn’t
know
she
had
,
describing
their
chance
meeting
as
if
by
magic
.
Several
people
told
me
of
times
this
week
that
they
ran
into
the
just
the
right
person
at
just
the
right
time
.
Maybe
magic
disguises
itself
as
love
,
especially
when
we
are
least
expecting
it
.
The
writer
Amy
Krouse
Rosenthal
coined
a
handy
acronym
for
this
feeling
,
ATM
Always
Trust
Magic
.
This
is
my
goal
this
spring
semester
,
to
trust
in
the
magic
that
is
pointing
me
in
directions
I
didn’t
think
I
would
ever
go
and
towards
people
I
didn’t
expect
to
meet
.
To
line
my
pockets
with
lucky
pennies
.
Take
a
look
at
any
Duke
admissions
pamphlet
,
or
Duke’s
website
.
Any
prospective
student
has
probably
read
class
demographic
numbers
like
25
percent
Asian
,
Asian
American
,
Pacific
Islander
;
13
percent
Black
African
American
;
14
percent
Hispanic
Latino
.
They
see
photos
of
smiling
groups
of
students
of
different
races
and
ethnicities
walking
across
the
quad
,
eating
in
West
Union
,
cheering
at
a
basketball
game
.
Indeed
,
one
of
the
aspects
about
Duke
that
attracted
me
was
that
when
I
visited
campus
,
I
was
actually
seeing
the
diversity
of
the
student
body
that
the
admissions
office
advertises
.
I
was
excited
to
find
and
become
best
friends
with
people
of
all
races
and
backgrounds
,
similar
to
my
friend
group
in
high
school
.
But
while
one
might
say
that
Duke
is
diverse
although
most
statistics
comfortably
leave
out
that
each
class
is
still
at
least
47
percent
white
in
navigating
social
circles
on
campus
,
I’ve
found
very
few
social
spaces
that
showcase
the
balanced
diversity
Duke
prides
itself
on
.
Especially
during
my
first
year
,
I
felt
torn
between
seeking
community
in
black
Duke
or
staying
in
the
close
friendships
I
had
developed
from
my
pre
orientation
program
,
who
,
for
the
most
part
,
were
all
white
students
.
It
seemed
like
,
especially
as
a
black
student
at
Duke
,
I
couldn’t
have
both
.
It
was
either
find
an
all
black
friend
group
who
understood
what
it’s
like
to
be
a
minority
student
at
a
historically
white
and
elite
institution
,
or
be
the
for
lack
of
a
better
word
token
in
my
white
friend
group
.
As
someone
who
vehemently
defends
and
values
the
importance
of
diversity
and
inclusion
,
I
sometimes
felt
like
a
hypocrite
when
I
realized
that
the
majority
of
my
close
friends
all
belonged
to
one
race
.
Diversity
is
having
a
variety
of
races
,
religions
,
political
beliefs
,
sexual
orientations
,
socioeconomic
backgrounds
,
etc
.
present
on
campus
.
Admitting
a
diverse
student
body
is
important
,
but
it’s
only
half
the
battle
at
best
.
Inclusion
promotes
and
sustains
a
sense
of
belonging
.
.
.
the
inherent
worth
of
all
people
are
recognized
.
Inclusion
implies
valued
interactions
between
diverse
groups
of
people
.
Duke
should
care
more
about
fostering
diverse
social
spaces
on
campus
.
Close
groups
of
diverse
individuals
breeds
understanding
,
but
having
people
different
than
you
that
you
only
see
from
time
to
time
in
class
or
across
campus
only
leads
to
the
same
ignorance
and
stereotypes
.
If
we
just
see
people
different
than
us
but
never
interact
except
maybe
in
randomly
assigned
groups
in
the
classroom
no
stereotypes
are
being
broken
down
,
and
few
generalized
beliefs
about
groups
different
than
us
are
being
challenged
.
This
past
summer
,
I
was
a
staffer
for
a
pre
orientation
program
and
had
an
extremely
diverse
group
of
incoming
first
years
in
my
crew
.
One
signature
part
of
being
in
a
crew
is
sharing
your
life
story
,
including
your
hopes
,
fears
,
deepest
thoughts
,
best
and
worst
moments
,
with
the
other
first
years
and
staffers
.
No
matter
how
homogenous
the
place
they
come
from
,
these
first
years
are
quickly
to
the
dynamic
myriad
of
life
experiences
that
make
their
classmates
much
more
than
the
two
dimensional
stereotypes
that
may
be
attached
to
their
identities
.
I
hope
that
wherever
my
crewlings
go
in
their
journey
through
Duke
,
they
remember
these
life
stories
.
Here
are
some
ways
I
think
we
could
accomplish
more
inclusion
One
argument
for
a
way
in
which
Duke
administration
is
attempting
to
foster
more
strong
relationships
between
people
from
different
backgrounds
is
with
the
policy
that
all
members
of
the
class
of
2022
would
be
assigned
random
roommates
.
The
reasoning
behind
this
decision
was
that
students
would
benefit
from
having
a
chance
to
explore
their
roommate’s
history
,
culture
and
interests
.
While
I
am
all
for
exposing
students
to
people
who
differ
in
background
and
interest
,
in
a
living
situation
,
I
am
curious
as
to
whether
this
approach
really
benefits
minority
or
socio
economically
disadvantaged
students
.
These
students
don’t
need
someone
to
teach
them
about
white
privilege
or
economic
privilege
;
they
know
firsthand
.
The
learning
here
is
mostly
being
done
by
the
student
who
already
has
privilege
,
and
while
this
is
valuable
learning
,
it
could
make
an
uncomfortable
or
challenging
living
space
for
the
other
student
while
the
learning
process
is
taking
place
.
As
a
university
,
we
can
do
better
at
making
inclusive
spaces
without
placing
the
burden
on
those
who
are
already
under
privileged
in
society
.
Does
Duke
really
care
about
students
from
different
backgrounds
forming
strong
bonds
and
learning
from
each
other
outside
of
the
classroom
,
or
are
we
satisfied
with
shiny
photos
and
statistics
on
the
Admissions
website
that
reel
students
in
,
only
to
for
the
most
part
remain
around
the
people
who
look
most
like
them
for
the
next
four
years
?
While
tapping
through
the
300th
Best
of
2018
Instagram
story
on
my
feed
,
I
stopped
to
reflect
on
the
year
as
a
whole
.
As
anyone
with
two
brain
cells
knows
,
2018
was
not
a
golden
year
for
the
United
States
,
let
alone
the
rest
of
the
world
.
As
any
good
Duke
student
knows
,
2018
for
Duke
,
quite
frankly
,
sucked
.
Between
the
student
health
insurance
fiasco
,
horrific
security
issues
and
some
tragic
campus
losses
R
.
I
.
P
.
to
the
walk
up
line
,
I
spent
the
last
days
of
winter
break
staring
at
my
phone
,
wondering
,
Did
anything
good
happen
at
Duke
this
year
?
Is
there
even
a
point
to
hope
for
improvement
in
2019
?
Rather
than
drowning
in
my
own
ennui
,
I
decided
to
sit
down
with
President
Price
and
find
out
exactly
how
Duke
plans
to
change
for
the
New
Year
.
Here’s
a
sneak
peek
of
what
you
have
to
look
forward
to
this
semester
.

And
just
like
that
,
our
interview
came
to
a
close
.
Any
glimmer
of
hope
I
had
for
the
university
to
change
quickly
disappeared
,
yet
I
felt
a
strange
set
of
comfort
.
Though
our
world
is
tumultuous
and
unpredictable
,
we
can
always
rely
on
Duke
administrators
to
stay
the
same
.
I’m
in
a
group
chat
of
writers
called
sadboi
hours
.
At
Project
Arts
,
two
writers
were
given
awards
for
being
the
most
angsty
.
While
it’s
easy
to
joke
about
a
writer’s
tendency
to
be
existential
and
self
deprecating
,
these
jokes
are
grounded
in
a
very
real
pattern
.
Sylvia
Plath
,
Ernest
Hemingway
,
Virginia
Woolf
;
all
tortured
geniuses
.
As
a
person
who
wants
to
write
and
be
happy
,
this
association
between
creativity
and
suffering
has
always
bothered
me
.
In
some
ways
,
it
makes
sense
.
It’s
the
people
who
are
neurotic
,
sensitive
,
and
curious
to
the
point
of
self
destruction
that
can
write
about
how
all
people
have
ulterior
motives
,
a
five
year
long
unrequited
love
,
and
a
girl
watching
a
woman
catch
on
fire
out
of
sheer
curiosity
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye
,
The
Great
Gatsby
,
Sula
.
While
writing
doesn’t
have
to
focus
on
the
negative
,
the
best
books
are
about
complicated
problems
.
It’s
the
Anna
Karenina
principle
happiness
is
a
delicate
combination
of
factors
,
and
the
absence
of
even
one
of
these
factors
creates
a
unique
and
interesting
form
of
sadness
,
which
is
worth
writing
about
.
The
sheer
variety
and
nuance
to
negative
emotions
makes
them
more
compelling
to
read
and
write
about
.
I
wish
I
could
say
that
I
was
immune
to
this
tortured
writer
phenomenon
,
but
I’ve
had
my
fair
share
of
angst
.
When
I
read
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye
,
I
related
to
the
cynical
and
neurotic
Holden
Caulfield
so
much
that
I
didn’t
realize
that
he
was
meant
to
be
an
unreliable
narrator
.
I’ve
never
written
a
poem
about
something
positive
.
My
own
experience
has
also
shown
me
that
it’s
not
just
that
many
creatives
have
self
destructive
tendencies
,
but
that
the
writing
process
itself
is
hard
.
George
Orwell
compared
writing
a
book
to
having
a
demon
run
after
you
.
I
hated
that
I
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
.
The
crippling
thing
about
art
is
that
you
can
recognize
good
art
instantaneously
but
even
bad
art
can
take
years
to
create
;
I’ve
heavily
criticized
a
story
before
realizing
that
I
couldn’t
write
anything
nearly
as
good
.
Writing
is
also
unpredictable
and
nonlinear
.
Sometimes
I
write
a
poem
I’m
proud
of
in
five
minutes
and
sometimes
I
spend
ten
minutes
crafting
a
sentence
that
I
end
up
deleting
.
Blogger
Maria
Popova
said
,
Without
their
art
,
all
of
these
tortured
artists
would
have
suffered
more
.
But
I
don’t
think
that’s
true
.
Writing
is
just
a
tool
.
It
can
be
used
to
excuse
self
destructive
tendencies
,
to
put
oneself
in
dangerous
situations
just
to
feel
something
that
could
be
in
a
novel
someday
.
It
can
be
used
to
ruminate
over
problems
,
to
circle
around
sadness
like
a
vulture
just
for
that
one
beautiful
sentence
.
I
once
wrote
for
two
hours
about
a
petty
argument
with
a
friend
,
only
to
find
myself
more
upset
than
I
was
before
.
If
I
tried
to
make
my
life
a
work
of
art
,
I
would
probably
be
a
better
writer
.
But
my
life
would
also
be
much
more
dramatic
and
depressing
I
would
probably
also
be
living
in
Berlin
with
a
group
of
artists
where
I
would
fall
in
love
with
someone
new
every
ten
days
and
die
at
24
of
some
overdose
.
While
writing
has
the
potential
to
encourage
self
destructive
tendencies
,
it
can
also
be
a
powerful
tool
for
reflection
.
It’s
impossible
to
wrestle
with
thousands
of
denotations
and
connotations
without
coming
away
with
a
better
understanding
.
Sometimes
I
don’t
know
how
I
feel
about
something
until
I
write
about
it
.
Writing
has
made
me
a
better
thinker
and
helped
me
figure
out
what’s
important
.
As
long
as
I
remember
that
writing
is
a
supplement
to
life
,
and
not
life
itself
,
I
can
understand
my
struggles
without
miring
myself
in
them
.
In
the
same
vein
,
the
writing
process
doesn’t
have
to
be
demonic
.
It
may
never
be
enjoyable
in
the
way
that
a
donut
is
enjoyable
,
but
it
can
be
satisfying
in
the
way
a
good
workout
or
finishing
a
long
assignment
can
be
.
I
used
to
be
paralyzed
by
the
idea
that
every
word
I
put
out
into
the
world
has
to
be
perfect
,
but
I’ve
realized
that
any
piece
I
create
will
make
me
a
better
writer
.
Since
I
tend
to
write
about
personal
things
,
criticisms
of
my
work
can
feel
like
personal
attacks
.
But
it’s
a
strangely
comforting
thought
that
no
one
cares
about
my
writing
as
much
as
I
do
,
that
even
if
they
don’t
like
my
work
they’ll
probably
forget
about
it
.
While
I
believe
writing
is
important
,
taking
it
less
seriously
has
made
me
more
willing
to
accept
the
inevitable
failure
and
criticism
that
comes
with
the
creative
process
.
We’re
all
writing
stories
about
ourselves
in
our
heads
.
I
choose
for
my
story
to
be
about
an
untortured
writer
.
On
Friday
,
we
were
told
that
three
of
our
Greek
chapters
are
being
investigated
for
alleged
hazing
.
Our
community
has
been
silent
for
five
days
.
On
Saturday
,
we
were
told
that
a
professor
had
acted
in
a
manner
certainly
offensive
and
possibly
illegal
.
I
have
never
seen
so
many
people
come
online
so
fast
.
Why
are
we
selectively
outraged
?
I
do
not
put
these
two
reports
on
a
scale
,
as
if
to
know
which
is
worthier
of
outrage
.
I
observe
that
our
response
to
one
developing
report
does
not
absolve
our
silence
towards
another
.
For
the
sake
of
full
disclosure
,
know
that
I
hold
Greek
life
in
no
particular
esteem
.
At
best
,
it
seems
an
odd
and
forced
way
to
make
friends
.
At
worst
,
it’s
an
enclave
of
sexism
and
groupthink
which
can’t
get
from
here
to
there
without
doing
bad
things
.
However
,
I
,
like
Greek
affiliated
students
,
am
a
member
of
the
Duke
community
.
I
,
like
Greek
affiliated
students
,
am
a
member
of
the
human
community
.
And
when
I
hear
that
people
may
have
been
abused
,
I
think
it’s
the
right
thing
to
say
something
about
that
no
matter
who
they
are
.
Duke’s
chapters
of
Delta
Tau
Delta
and
Pi
Kappa
Phi
have
been
suspended
,
and
all
new
member
activities
at
Sigma
Pi
Epsilon
have
been
suspended
pending
a
hazing
investigation
,
read
Friday’s
Chronicle
article
.
And
how
does
Duke
define
hazing
?
Per
The
Duke
Community
Standard
,
hazing
is
defined
as
any
action
taken
or
situation
created
,
whether
on
or
off
university
premises
,
that
is
harmful
or
potentially
harmful
to
an
individual’s
physical
,
emotional
,
or
psychological
well
being
,
regardless
of
an
individual’s
willingness
to
participate
or
its
bearing
on
his
her
membership
status
.
A
hazing
investigation
across
three
chapters
means
that
at
minimum
,
three
of
your
peers
were
allegedly
harmed
or
put
into
harm’s
way
.
This
story
was
published
on
Friday
the
25th
.
We
have
been
silent
about
this
for
five
days
.
Is
that
because
we
don’t
like
Greek
life
students
very
much
?
I
speak
now
to
independents
.
The
relative
silence
of
Greek
organizations
in
the
wake
of
these
reports
is
reprehensible
and
deserving
of
its
own
full
treatment
.
It’s
no
secret
that
we
resent
Greeks
.
It’s
an
us
versus
them
mentality
.
They
are
less
than
.
We
perform
this
mentality
annually
in
the
agonized
should
you
or
shouldn’t
you
columns
about
rushing
.
We
perform
it
daily
in
eye
rolling
conversations
.
When
there’s
a
social
problem
at
Duke
,
it’s
the
Greeks’
fault
.
Consider
this
theory
,
penned
earlier
in
the
month
I
would
venture
to
maintain
that
most
,
if
not
all
,
independent
students
would
struggle
to
identify
the
personality’
of
their
house
,
to
name
even
one
of
their
house’s
traditions
,
’
and
to
honestly
assert
that
their
house
is
a
home
.
’
A
house
is
no
more
than
the
people
in
it
.
Giving
the
Blue
Devils
in
Greek
life
their
due
,
they’ve
discovered
that
communities
sink
or
swim
with
the
effort
people
put
into
them
.
Who
would
have
thought
.
Consider
this
lovely
thought
from
last
April
It’s
no
surprise
that
independent
houses
are
having
problems
;
they’re
a
series
of
communities
largely
composed
of
people
that
were
cut
from
SLGs
Greeks
included
.
The
problem
isn’t
with
us
,
but
with
the
people
who
didn’t
like
us
.
We
aren’t
failing
to
take
responsibility
for
building
up
our
own
communities
.
We
were
just
excluded
from
ready
made
communities
the
odds
of
joining
which
we
knew
to
be
very
much
against
us
.

We
resent
students
in
Greek
life
.
They
are
the
reason
that
we
are
consistently
unable
or
unwilling
to
build
the
least
semblance
of
community
in
our
own
situations
.
So
how
do
we
treat
those
involved
in
this
process
of
rejecting
and
being
rejected
?
We
reject
them
from
our
circle
of
empathy
when
they
might
need
us
most
.
Where
is
the
outrage
for
these
alleged
victims
?
Where
is
the
L
Mo
email
telling
concerned
pledges
how
to
connect
with
Duke’s
support
services
?
Where
is
the
strongly
worded
email
from
President
Price
saying
that
whatever
happened
,
the
University
thinks
hazing
is
unacceptable
?
Perhaps
you
think
So
what
?
If
something
did
happen
,
they
knew
what
they
were
getting
into
.
Is
that
your
reasoning
?
They
were
asking
for
it
?
Are
there
any
other
kinds
of
harm
that
you’re
prepared
to
say
victims
were
asking
for
?
Do
you
believe
only
certain
kinds
of
victims
?
Or
maybe
you’re
trusting
the
proper
channels
to
take
care
of
this
.
One
such
channel
,
alongside
the
University
and
DUPD
,
is
the
fraternities
themselves
.
For
students
so
concerned
about
systemic
obstructions
to
justice
,
we
seem
fine
with
trusting
the
people
who
may
be
at
fault
to
help
decide
whether
they’re
at
fault
.
We
demand
independent
investigations
of
anything
that
needs
investigating
,
except
for
the
alleged
abuse
of
our
peers
.
Or
you
think
that
this
is
an
allegation
really
there’s
no
proof
so
why
react
now
?
None
of
the
fraternities
are
on
record
as
denying
the
allegation
.
Do
Greek
organizations
have
a
gaping
hole
where
diversity
should
be
?
Yes
.
Does
the
selectivity
of
Greek
organizations
inflict
real
emotional
harm
?
Yes
.
I
am
the
first
person
to
say
that
Greek
life
does
immense
harm
and
needs
to
put
its
house
in
order
if
it
hopes
to
retain
what
little
of
our
respect
it
enjoys
.
I
also
believe
that
when
immense
harm
is
allegedly
done
to
people
involved
in
Greek
life
,
they
deserve
the
same
sympathy
as
anyone
else
who
may
have
been
harmed
.
I
am
not
calling
for
a
rush
to
judgment
.
I
am
not
calling
for
some
kangaroo
court
.
I
am
calling
you
to
consider
whether
your
silence
,
your
quiescence
about
this
investigation
,
is
due
to
a
bias
against
students
in
Greek
life
.
I
opened
with
no
quotation
,
and
I
will
close
with
no
quotation
,
because
the
hypocrisy
displayed
by
this
community
in
the
past
week
needs
no
ornament
to
show
it
for
what
it
is
.
Reform
housing
?
Reform
yourselves
.
Do
you
feel
big
,
as
you
go
about
calling
out
everyone
else’s
prejudices
while
keeping
your
own
tucked
in
place
and
turning
a
blind
eye
?
My
only
argument
is
this
we
shouldn’t
turn
a
blind
eye
when
a
bad
thing
may
have
happened
because
of
whom
it
may
have
happened
to
.
We
care
all
the
way
,
or
not
at
all
.
We
think
you
might
already
be
a
supporter
of
Effective
Altruism
,
but
just
don’t
know
it
yet
.
To
find
out
,
let’s
go
through
four
claims
.
These
claims
are
based
on
Sam
Deere’s
article
,
Four
Ideas
You
Already
Agree
With
.
First
,
helping
others
is
important
.
We
think
most
people
agree
that
helping
others
is
important
.
I
mean
,
imagine
defending
the
opposite
position
helping
others
is
not
important
!
Of
course
,
this
doesn’t
seem
like
a
helpful
or
correct
claim
.
This
is
a
pretty
simple
assumption
,
but
its
implications
might
be
deeper
than
many
people
notice
in
the
real
world
.
Second
,
all
people
are
equal
.
Do
all
people
matter
,
regardless
of
characteristics
like
age
,
skin
color
,
gender
,
nationality
,
or
religion
?
Should
we
use
these
characteristics
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
help
someone
?
If
you
think
that
none
of
these
characteristics
should
bar
someone
from
a
claim
to
a
happy
,
healthy
and
free
life
,
then
we
think
you’re
in
good
company
.
Third
,
helping
more
people
is
better
than
helping
fewer
people
.
Well
,
in
what
world
would
it
be
better
to
help
fewer
people
than
to
help
more
people
?
Sam
Deere
writes
,
nbsp
;
Imagine
twenty
sick
people
lining
a
hospital
ward
,
who’ll
die
if
you
don’t
give
them
medicine
.
You
have
enough
medicine
for
everyone
,
and
no
reason
to
hold
onto
it
for
later
would
anyone
really
choose
to
arbitrarily
save
only
some
of
the
people
if
it
was
just
as
easy
to
save
of
them
?
If
you
think
we
should
try
to
do
more
to
help
people
when
we
have
the
resources
to
help
,
then
you’re
in
good
company
.
Fourth
,
we
have
limited
resources
.
If
we
had
unlimited
resources
,
then
we’d
be
able
to
embark
on
every
philanthropic
venture
we
could
imagine
,
from
handing
out
malaria
bed
nets
across
all
of
Africa
to
distributing
lollipops
to
all
the
children
and
maybe
adults
too
,
why
not
?
of
the
world
!
But
if
you
agree
with
us
that
our
resources
are
finite
,
meaning
we
can
only
devote
so
much
money
to
each
cause
,
then
the
idea
of
opportunity
cost
should
help
guide
our
actions
.
Fifty
dollars
to
the
Lollipop
Charity
might
mean
no
money
for
the
Against
Malaria
Foundation
,
which
is
estimated
to
save
the
life
of
someone
who
would
have
otherwise
died
,
for
about
3
,
464
.
If
your
answers
are
similar
to
these
,
or
if
these
answers
line
up
with
your
thinking
,
then
you
just
might
be
a
fan
of
Effective
Altruism
!
Effective
Altruism
is
a
movement
of
people
around
the
world
who
are
seeking
to
answer
this
simple
question
how
can
we
do
good
,
better
?
Aspiring
EAs
apply
multiple
disciplines
to
work
on
this
question
,
employing
reason
and
evidence
under
the
assumption
that
taking
a
step
back
and
thinking
about
the
best
path
forward
to
help
the
most
people
is
not
an
obvious
answer
.
It
requires
careful
thinking
,
and
our
actions
,
donations
,
and
decisions
will
be
better
if
we
take
time
to
think
through
the
possibilities

To
help
reduce
poverty
,
is
it
better
to
invest
in
malaria
bednet
distribution
,
deworming
initiatives
,
or
something
else
entirely
?
Does
working
with
local
governments
for
these
projects
improve
the
quality
of
the
state
,
or
does
it
potentially
add
strength
and
legitimacy
to
exploitative
institutions
?
Should
we
try
to
do
things
to
prevent
low
probability
events
that
could
lead
to
the
end
of
humanity
,
like
nuclear
war
?
How
would
we
even
know
if
we’re
making
progress
on
those
causes
?
Is
factory
farming
a
moral
harm
?
And
if
so
,
what
can
we
do
to
reduce
the

experience
everyday
for

Effective
Altruism
is
a
unique
movement
.
It
can
be
difficult
to
define
some
people
call
it
a
community
,
others
a
philosophy
,
and
yet
others
a
research
agenda
.
It’s
a
mix
of
all
of
these
things
,
and
it
is
constantly
evolving
.
This
column
exists
for
members
of
Effective
Altruism
Duke
to
share
the
ideas
that
EA
explores
,
especially
ideas
about
effective
giving
and
pragmatic
philanthropy
.
We’ll
use
this
framework
to
explore
diverse
topics
.
For
instance
,
we
will
analyze
how
to
choose
your
major
and
career
,
make
the
case
for
vegetarianism
,
and
discuss
how
to
prevent
promising
technologies
from
being
abused
.
These
ideas
aren’t
settled
.
Indeed
,
as
Helen
Toner
from
the
Open
Philanthropy
Project
wrote
,
Effective
Altruism
is
a
question
,
rather
than
a
set
of
unchanging
beliefs
.
Even
within
Effective
Altruism
,
there
is
plenty
of
disagreement
.
And
that’s
good
!
If
you
disagree
with
some
of
the
ideas
or
methods
or
assumptions
,
you
could
be
a
valuable
contributor
,
and
we’d
love
to
hear
from
you
.
And
if
you’re
interested
in
this
approach
to
making
the
world
a
better
place
,
we’d
encourage
you
to
keep
up
this
column
,
and
we’d
love
to
hear
from
you
too
.
I
disagreed
with
quite
a
bit
of
the
content
of
my
fellow
columnist
Lizzie
Bond’s
latest
column
,
but
I
want
to
focus
on
one
point
in
particular
her
assertion
that
Duke
students
who
arrive
at
Duke
discover
that
an
on
campus
residential
community
is
a
luxury
,
not
a
right
.
Let’s
slow
down
and
consider
whether
or
not
human
beings
inherently
have
a
right
to
community
,
both
because
this
question
is
important
in
and
of
itself
,
but
also
because
our
answer
to
this
question
has
serious
implications
for
how
we
ought
to
structure
the
future
of
housing
at
Duke
.
Let’s
review
some
things
we
all
know
to
be
true
about
the
nature
of
communities
.
First
,
generally
speaking
,
communities
are
not
spontaneous
creations
.
The
best
communities
are
consciously
created
,
defined
and
structured
.
Second
,
let’s
remember
that
this
process
of
creation
is
actually
somewhat
difficult
.
Creating
a
healthy
,
strong
and
fulfilling
community
takes
time
and
effort
,
careful
planning
and
care
.
Just
ask
the
rush
chairs
of
any
prominent
SLG
or
Greek
life
organization
on
campus
.
Finally
and
most
importantly
,
communities
have
limits
.
If
a
community
is
to
survive
,
its
membership
must
have
defined
characteristics
and
be
limited
in
scope
.
After
all
,
a
community
that
consists
of
everyone
ultimately
consists
of
no
one
because
such
a
community
lacks
a
sense
of
identity
and
character
.
So
when
Bond
implies
that
we
have
a
right
to
community
,
I
am
left
deeply
confused
.
Human
beings
do
not
have
a
right
to
associate
with
other
human
beings
.
Moreover
,
this
principle
applies
regardless
of
whether
the
situation
is
an
individual
interacting
with
another
individual
or
if
the
situation
is
an
individual
interacting
with
a
group
of
individuals
a
.
k
.
a
.
,
a
community
.
So
I
ask
,
on
what
basis
do
we
have
a
right
to
associate
with
other
human
beings
?
Furthermore
,
if
we
do
have
a
human
right
to
the
community
of
others
and
if
that
right
is
inalienable
as
all
human
rights
are
,
are
we
allowed
to
exercise
that
right
regardless
of
whether
the
other
people
in
question
consent
?
I’m
sure
most
people
,
especially
on
Duke’s
campus
,
would
have
an
issue
with
that
implication
.
Rather
,
we
have
access
to
the
privilege
of
associating
with
others
after
earning
their
trust
and
respect
and
receiving
their
consent
.
But
to
play
with
Lizzie’s
idea
that
we
have
a
right
to
community
a
little
more
,
let’s
try
applying
that
idea
to
a
practical
scenario
on
campus
.
Suppose
that
I
walked
up
to
Ryan
Williams
,
a
fellow
columnist
and
the
rush
chair
for
Cooper
,
and
demanded
to
enter
a
Cooper
event
because
of
my
inalienable
right
to
community
.
I’m
not
a
betting
man
,
but
I
would
bet
that
Ryan
would
,
entirely
reasonably
,
tell
me
to
go
to
hell
.
If
he
cared
to
explain
his
reasons
,
he
would
likely
say
that
I
had
not
contributed
to
Cooper’s
community
,
that
I
had
not
paid
dues
,
that
I
had
not
helped
set
up
,
that
I
had
not
respected
the
community’s
customs
by
going
through
the
entirety
of
the
rush
process
,
and
that
,
therefore
,
I
had
no
right
to
be
a
part
of
Cooper’s
community
.
In
short
,
he
would
explain
that
I
had
not
the
privilege
of
being
a
part
of
Cooper
.
And
he
would
be
right
in
no
way
,
shape
,
or
form
would
I
deserve
to
enter
that
event
and
mingle
amongst
the
wonderful
members
of
Cooper
.
I
look
forward
to
continuing
the
debate
about
the
future
of
selective
housing
on
the
pages
of
the
Chronicle
,
but
I
would
encourage
Lizzie
,
and
all
my
fellow
columnists
,
to
conduct
this
debate
with
prudence
.
No
one
needs
to
make
grandiose
,
unsupported
claims
about
the
rights
of
man
just
to
explain
an
objection
to
selective
housing
on
a
college
campus
.
The
Cameron
Crazies
will
compete
in
trivia
Wednesday
to
determine
who
gets
the
first
spots
in
line
for
the
North
Carolina
game
.
On
Saturday
,
I
was
one
of
the
many
people
who
crowded
into
Cameron
Indoor
for
a
Duke
vs
.
Virginia
matchup
that
did
not
disappoint
.
I
jumped
,
I
screamed
,
and
I
sweated
profusely
.
It
felt
,
as
it
often
does
in
Cameron
,
that
everyone
was
united
as
a
Duke
community
.
Except
for
one
guy
who
was
a
few
feet
away
from
me
and
at
least
a
few
beers
deep
.
Multiple
times
,
he
screamed
the
name
of
a
UVA
player
as
loud
as
he
could
,
and
then
yelled
,
you
suck
d
ck
!
I
love
the
overall
energy
of
the
student
section
.
I
love
the
dirt
sheets
.
I
have
no
problem
screaming
at
the
refs
when
they
make
bad
calls
.
And
chanting
UMBC
when
Virginia
was
shooting
free
throws
was
maybe
the
best
thing
ever
.
Being
ruthless
to
our
opponents
is
part
of
what
makes
games
fun
,
and
what
makes
Cameron
one
of
the
most
notorious
arenas
in
college
basketball
.
But
his
comment
made
me
uncomfortable
,
and
looking
around
,
I
could
tell
that
others
felt
the
same
.
What
makes
you
suck
d
ck
different
from
anything
else
we
yell
at
our
opponents
?
It’s
different
because
it’s
not
about
a
player
,
his
mistakes
in
the
game
,
or
even
his
personal
life
.
By
using
that
phrase
,
the
insinuation
is
that
the
player
is
gay
,
or
at
least
engages
in
homosexual
acts
.
And
when
it’s
used
as
an
insult
,
the
implication
is
that
gay
equals
bad
.
If
you
don’t
think
it’s
about
that
,
ask
yourself
why
no
one
insults
men
by
suggesting
that
they
engage
in
sexual
acts
with
women
.
That
wouldn’t
be
considered
as
mean
if
anything
,
it
could
be
taken
as
a
compliment
.
It
might
seem
like
a
harmless
comment
,
and
one
could
argue
that
the
guy
didn’t
mean
anything
by
it
.
But
the
effects
of
words
that
target
an
identity
can
be
hard
to
understand
when
that
identity
is
not
yours
.
When
I
played
Little
League
baseball
,
I
didn’t
fully
understand
why
my
mom
was
so
upset
that
our
assistant
coach
referred
to
us
as
ladies
when
we
played
poorly
.
He
was
,
of
course
,
equating
our
bad
fielding
to
being
female
.
He
was
equating
femininity
with
weakness
.
Since
it
wasn’t
gender
being
used
to
chastise
,
I
didn’t
think
much
of
it
.
But
I
have
since
realized
how
much
comments
like
grow
a
pair
and
don’t
be
a
p
sy
can
upset
the
female
identifying
people
around
me
.
You
suck
d
ck
works
in
a
similar
way
if
your
sexuality
isn’t
the
butt
of
the
joke
,
it’s
hard
to
understand
how
degrading
and
isolating
it
can
make
someone
feel
.
This
kind
of
language
is
a
symptom
of
a
larger
problem
.
Many
columnists
have
discussed
the
difficulty
of
finding
a
community
at
Duke
.
Comments
that
turn
an
aspect
of
one’s
identity
into
an
insult
are
an
easy
way
to
make
someone
doubt
whether
Duke
is
their
place
.
A
death
threat
written
on
the
wall
of
a
first
year
dorm
three
years
ago
made
it
clear
that
not
everyone
in
our
campus
community
was
willing
to
accept
LGBTQ
identifying
individuals
.
And
even
when
this
group
is
not
explicitly
excluded
,
it
is
not
particularly
included
in
society
at
large
.
Movies
,
lyrics
in
popular
music
,
Greek
mixers
between
all
male
fraternities
and
all
female
sororities
in
all
of
these
,
representations
of
anything
other
than
heterosexuality
are
an
exception
to
the
norm
.
And
beyond
this
one
incident
,
there
is
the
general
fact
that
we
are
often
unaware
of
the
degree
to
which
intolerance
can
be
built
into
our
vernacular
.
A
fellow
columnist
wrote
about
the
importance
of
political
correctness
in
terms
of
respect
for
historically
marginalized
groups
.
What
makes
this
a
hard
but
important
ask
is
that
it
takes
effort
and
intentionality
to
make
changes
to
your
daily
language
.
Coming
into
college
,
I
didn’t
understand
how
casually
throwing
around
phrases
like
I’m
OCD
or
I
basically
have
PTSD
can
contribute
to
the
stigma
around
mental
health
.
I’m
still
struggling
to
adopt
gender
neutral
pronouns
into
my
vocabulary
.
But
I
think
the
most
important
first
step
is
to
recognize
the
implications
of
our
words
,
regardless
of
our
intent
.
When
our
opponents
walk
into
Cameron
,
and
when
our
players
walk
onto
the
court
at
other
schools
,
they’re
prepared
to
be
subjected
to
insults
and
mocking
like
it
or
not
,
it’s
part
of
the
game
.
But
Duke
students
who
flood
into
the
student
section
are
there
to
come
together
and
cheer
for
Duke
,
against
a
common
enemy
,
as
members
of
this
community
.
Duke
students
should
not
have
to
worry
about
peers
attacking
their
own
identity
to
distract
an
opposing
player
.
Duke
students
are
good
at
nbsp
;
thinking
of
creative
ways
to
torment
opponents
during
basketball
games
.
I
am
confident
that
we
can
find
clever
and
merciless
ways
to
make
Cameron
even
Crazier
without
insulting
the
identities
of
our
peers
.
Five
days
ago
,
Duke
University
took
action
against
three
fraternities
on
campus
following
reports
of
hazing
.
Duke’s
chapters
of
Pi
Kappa
Phi
and
Delta
Tau
Delta
have
been
suspended
entirely
,
while
Sigma
Phi
Epsilon
has
had
new
member
activities
suspended
as
the
university
investigates
the
allegations
.
These
incidents
highlight
a
nationally
recognized
issue
with
Greek
life
,
but
they
also
bring
to
light
the
unaddressed
problems
of
Duke’s
living
communities
,
especially
concerning
the
heavily
exclusive
nature
of
these
communities
.
Originating
at
universities
nationwide
throughout
the
19th
century
,
Greek
letter
organizations
originally
served
to
foster
intellectual
discussions
among
close
knit
,
male
dominated
student
bodies
.
Phi
Beta
Kappa
,
the
nation’s
most
prestigious
honor
society
for
liberal
arts
undergraduates
,
remains
a
holdover
from
this
system
.
However
,
Greek
letter
organizations
have
since
evolved
into
exclusive
social
organizations
designed
to
foster
social
camaraderie
within
sanctioned
campus
chapters
throughout
the
United
States
.
In
this
context
,
a
Greek
letter
organization
is
understood
to
be
a
sex
exclusive
living
organization
that
provides
both
social
and
professional
benefits
for
those
who
buy
into
the
system
.
Fraternities
and
sororities
are
known
for
both
their
social
and
financial
exclusivity
,
which
at
Duke
can
mean
members
pay
dues
as
high
as
1
,
000
dollars
per
year
.
These
costs
often
do
not
include
the
unofficial
costs
associated
with
membership
in
an
affluent
social
group
with
a
specific
standard
of
living
that
assumes
one’s
ability
to
pay
for
it
spring
break
trips
,
date
functions
to
the
Washington
Duke
,
Carolina
Cup
,
etc
.
Every
year
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
Spring
semester
,
a
new
ambitious
first
year
class
enters
into
the
rush
process
at
Duke
,
seeking
entry
to
these
exclusive
social
organizations
.
The
process
is
widely
understood
by
the
student
population
to
be
damaging
both
physically
and
mentally
.
So
much
so
that
Resident
Assistants
in
first
year
dorms
are
given
training
to
help
students
preserve
their
mental
health
as
they
go
through
the
trying
process
of
seeking
a
social
niche
on
West
Campus
.
However
,
the
process
is
still
widely
participated
in
,
with
34
percent
of
students
on
campus
Greek
affiliated
and
a
further
percentage
associated
with
other
selective
living
groups
.
The
pressure
to
be
involved
with
one
social
group
or
another
is
put
upon
students
the
second
they
arrive
on
campus
,
with
events
already
introducing
first
years
to
different
selective
social
living
groups
on
campus
as
early
as
the
first
month
of
their
Fall
semester
.
This
pressure
is
part
of
a
larger
picture
of
exclusivity
and
social
stratification
at
Duke
,
which
is
endorsed
by
a
lack
of
action
taken
by
administrators
to
fix
the
system
.
Despite
movements
such
as
the
Duke
Students
for
Housing
Reform
group
formed
last
year
,
feasible
alternatives
to
the
current
Greek
SLG
centered
model
have
yet
to
be
fully
explored
.
For
many
first
year
students
,
given
the
supposed
lack
of
any
concrete
equivalent
to
a
close
knit
living
community
on
West
,
rush
seems
like
a
necessary
evil
in
order
to
find
an
appropriate
social
niche
at
Duke
.
Duke’s
exclusivity
does
not
simply
stop
with
the
selective
nature
of
housing
and
social
groups
.
It
instead
permeates
every
nook
of
the
Duke
experience
,
even
before
first
year
students
arrive
on
campus
in
August
.
Having
overcome
over
90
percent
of
other
applicants
in
the
mad
rat
race
of
being
admitted
into
this
university
,
we
find
ourselves
yet
again
competing
with
our
fellow
Duke
peers
to
obtain
desirable
social
positions
in
campus
life
.
From
selective
pre
orientation
programs
,
to
DukeEngage
,
to
internships
at
Goldman
Sachs
,
it
is
apparent
that
the
true
Duke
difference’
is
an
omnipresent
need
to
outperform
your
peers
,
not
just
academically
,
but
socially
.
In
the
face
of
such
competition
,
it
is
perhaps
unsurprising
that
Duke
students
report
significantly
higher
levels
of
stress
than
other
undergraduates
nationally
.
Duke
is
an
institution
that
puts
pressure
on
its
students
to
belong
to
one
social
group
or
another
through
their
living
organization
,
and
does
so
in
a
way
that
paints
selective
living
as
the
only
effective
way
to
maintain
a
social
group
past
one’s
first
year
.
With
pressure
so
high
,
many
male
identifying
Duke
students
are
desperate
to
secure
a
sense
of
belonging
to
an
organization
;
so
much
so
that
some
may
have
subjected
themselves
to
potential
hazing
to
secure
such
camaraderie
.
The
issue
here
is
less
national
Greek
life
not
to
say
there
are
not
problems
there
but
rather
to
do
with
the
pervasiveness
of
Duke’s
exclusivity
,
which
finds
its
way
into
the
social
fabric
that
makes
up
this
institution
.
Rick
Johnson
noted
that
the
fire
alarms
in
West
Union
have
gone
off
between
15
and
20
times
this
semester
.
How’s
everything
been
at
Duke
?
While
studying
abroad
last
semester
,
I
expected
to
hear
from
my
friends
on
campus
about
late
nights
at
Perkins
,
struggles
with
recruitment
,
cheering
at
Cameron
,
and
hilarious
memories
from
the
weekends
.
However
,
I
felt
uneasy
asking
this
question
because
it
pretended
as
if
the
semester
had
been
like
any
other
.
Even
for
those
of
us
who
were
across
the
ocean
,
it’s
impossible
to
escape
an
unfortunate
conclusion
our
campus
is
under
attack
from
intolerance
and
hate
.
Incidents
targeting
students
on
campus
for
their
religion
,
race
and
ethnicity
are
not
new
.
Last
year
,
we
witnessed
vandalism
in
300
Swift
targeting
a
student
for
her
friendships
within
Duke’s
African
American
community
and
someone
spreading
flyers
with
anti
Semitic
messages
.
Earlier
,
spray
painting
of
a
swastika
and
homophobic
language
on
the
Freedom
of
Expression
bridge
.
After
each
of
these
incidents
,
I
expected
an
impassioned
email
from
Larry
Moneta
condemning
the
acts
of
hate
,
and
encouraging
us
to
reach
out
for
support
if
needed
.
These
incidents
weren’t
far
removed
from
the
racial
tensions
that
bolstered
debates
over
the
Robert
E
.
Lee
statue
on
campus
,
or
the
firing
of
two
baristas
,
one
African
American
,
from
Joe
Van
Gogh
.
Leaving
campus
for
the
summer
,
these
events
largely
faded
from
my
mind
.
I
thought
they
may
have
been
blips
along
the
path
toward
a
more
tolerant
and
inclusive
campus
community
.
Unfortunately
,
the
past
six
months
have
suggested
the
opposite
.
When
students
arrived
back
on
campus
in
August
,
excited
for
a
new
year
ahead
,
the
black
community
was
welcomed
by
the
n
word
being
written
at
the
Mary
Lou
Williams
Center
.
As
a
proud
Jew
,
I
have
been
distressed
with
the
anti
Semitic
events
that
have
happened
,
again
and
again
.
Swastikas
,
symbols
that
glorify
the
deaths
of
millions
of
Jewish
families
like
my
own
,
have
been
found
everywhere
from
a
bathroom
stall
,
to
Halloween
pumpkins
,
and
even
on
the
beautiful
Tree
of
Life
Pittsburgh
shooting
mural
.
Even
after
these
unfortunate
incidents
,
the
neo
nazi
group
Identity
Evropa
placed
posters
around
campus
.
I
keep
hoping
each
occurance
will
be
the
last
,
but
it’s
not
as
if
these
events
are
taking
place
in
a
vacuum
.
Rather
,
they
are
part
of
an
emboldened
global
sentiment
of
fear
,
hate
and
xenophobia
.
Many
of
us
may
be
tempted
to
point
fingers
.
I
understand
why
I’m
always
hearing
that
these
events
are
because
of
the
last
presidential
election
,
and
acts
of
such
intolerance
are
part
of
Trump’s
America
.
I
don’t
doubt
a
connection
between
Donald
Trump
and
the
emboldened
sense
of
superiority
among
a
particular
segment
of
the
population
.
According
to
the
Anti
Defamation
League’s
Audit
of
Anti
Semitic
Incidents
,
719
more
incidents
were
reported
in
2017
than
in
2016
,
a
57
percent
surge
.
However
,
politics
aren’t
always
shaping
public
opinion
,
they’re
reflecting
it
.
Our
elected
officials
aren’t
the
main
problem
,
those
who
elect
them
us
are
.
This
is
not
a
matter
of
Democrats
versus
Republicans
,
or
liberals
versus
conservatives
.
People
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
are
promoting
a
specific
brand
of
identity
politics
,
just
as
people
on
both
sides
are
resenting
it
.
We
speak
about
the
issue
of
polarization
among
our
deeply
polarized
circles
,
and
dismiss
those
whom
we
believe
are
dismissing
us
.
We
are
siloed
not
only
for
what
we
believe
about
our
country
,
but
for
who
we
are
.
Walking
around
campus
,
we
often
see
uniform
groups
based
on
a
particular
identity
factor
.
I
don’t
claim
to
be
immune
from
this
;
I
do
it
all
of
the
time
.
Many
of
my
friends
are
Jewish
,
and
we
connect
over
a
common
religion
and
personhood
.
Interactions
like
these
feel
comfortable
because
they
are
familiar
.
But
staying
around
those
who
are
like
us
deprives
everyone
else
of
the
amazing
opportunity
to
learn
from
those
aren’t
.
Many
of
my
most
meaningful
conversations
at
Duke
were
learning
about
other
people’s
identities
.
These
interactions
opened
my
eyes
to
the
struggles
other
people
face
,
the
journeys
that
they
are
on
and
the
values
that
they
hold
.
Often
,
such
dialogue
makes
me
realize
that
the
ostensible
differences
between
my
peers
and
me
aren’t
so
significant
after
all
.
I
studied
abroad
at
the
Arava
Institute
for
Environmental
Studies
,
which
brings
together
Israelis
,
Palestinians
,
Jordanians
,
and
people
from
across
the
globe
to
learn
about
the
environment
and
build
peace
.
Throughout
the
semester
,
we
operated
on
the
principle
that
Nature
Knows
No
Borders
.
Regardless
of
where
we
were
from
,
what
religion
we
believed
in
,
and
what
perspectives
we
had
on
the
Arab
Israeli
conflict
,
we
all
faced
issues
relating
to
water
,
air
,
energy
,
and
biodiversity
.
There
were
striking
parallels
between
Middle
Eastern
cultures
,
such
as
close
familial
connections
,
innovation
to
overcome
adversity
,
and
delicious
food
.
The
program
provided
the
unique
opportunity
for
each
of
us
to
engage
with
the
other
overcoming
our
fears
,
learning
new
perspectives
,
and
meeting
amazing
people
.
We
participated
in
a
weekly
Peace
Building
Leadership
Seminar
,
during
which
we
discussed
some
of
the
most
contentious
issues
surrounding
the
conflict
.
Even
after
these
intense
sessions
,
we
would
all
eat
,
do
homework
and
hang
out
as
one
community
.
If
this
is
possible
within
one
of
the
world’s
most
contentious
conflicts
,
surely
it
must
be
possible
on
an
intellectually
engaged
university
campus
.
Here
at
Duke
,
we
often
overlook
that
same
incredible
asset
our
diversity
.
Ever
since
orientation
week
,
I
have
been
fascinated
by
the
wide
array
of
individuals
who
chose
Duke
to
become
their
home
.
I
believe
we
should
maximize
this
opportunity
and
get
to
know
our
fellow
Blue
Devils
,
shaping
us
into
more
tolerant
individuals
and
making
us
new
friends
along
the
way
.
Unfortunately
,
we
can’t
go
back
in
time
to
prevent
the
hateful
incidents
which
have
shaken
our
university
.
Nor
can
we
necessarily
prevent
all
of
them
in
the
future
.
Nonetheless
,
we
do
have
the
ability
to
celebrate
the
diversity
amongst
our
student
body
and
the
agency
to
create
a
more
welcoming
,
inclusive
and
accepting
campus
.
Let’s
not
succumb
to
the
fear
which
the
perpetrators
of
such
heinous
acts
strive
to
instill
in
us
.
Let’s
not
close
ourselves
off
in
the
face
of
such
distress
and
discrimination
.
Instead
,
we
can
take
action
in
our
daily
lives
.
We
must
fight
intolerance
by
embracing
diversity
.
More
than
800
Duke
undergrads
will
move
into
Krzyzewskiville
Saturday
for
the
start
of
black
tenting
,
but
they
had
to
earn
their
spot
first
.
For
me
,
that
craziest
part
of
rushing
SLGs
my
first
year
wasn’t
going
to
the
events
.
I
didn’t
black
out
at
any
parties
or
dance
on
any
tables
but
I
did
have
a
crazy
bid
day
.
A
brief
bit
of
my
mental
state
on
Saturday
,
January
27th
,
2018
I
swear
I
go
to
other
places
at
Duke
,
but
this
story
also
revolves
around
an
experience
I
had
at
Shooters
II
Saloon
.
I
had
survived
both
Brownstone
and
Cooper
until
the
final
round
.
I
had
been
to
more
events
for
Cooper
,
only
missing
one
or
two
throughout
the
rush
process
.
I
really
liked
both
,
but
I
felt
like
I
clicked
better
with
the
upperclassmen
from
Cooper
.
Flash
forward
to
Saturday
the
27th
.
For
the
first
time
in
a
few
weeks
,
there
weren’t
any
rush
events
to
attend
,
so
I
decided
to
go
to
Shooters
with
a
couple
friends
.
nbsp
;
About
halfway
through
the
night
at
Shoots
,
a
friend
who
had
also
rushed
Cooper
came
up
to
me
and
exclaimed
Dude
,
I
got
into
Cooper
.
Amidst
the
haze
and
loud
music
in
Shooters
,
I
was
confused
.
How
do
you
know
?
Who
told
you
?
He
said
They
sent
an
email
!
Check
your
phone
!
I
slipped
away
and
pulled
up
my
inbox
I
held
my
breath
as
I
tapped
on
the
email
with
the
subject
Cooper
Rush
Round
3
Result
.
The
first
words
,
after
Hi
,
Luke
,
were
I’m
sorry
to
inform
you
.
I
was
shocked
and
upset
.
I
was
impressed
by
everyone
I
had
met
in
Cooper
during
rush
and
I
thought
I
would’ve
fit
in
really
well
.
I
came
back
near
the
dancefloor
and
found
my
friend
,
and
told
him
that
I
didn’t
get
in
.
As
soon
as
I
said
it
,
I
could
see
that
he
regretted
telling
me
Cooper
decisions
had
come
out
.
Maybe
he
was
tipsy
and
not
thinking
straight
,
or
maybe
he
thought
I
had
a
good
shot
,
too
.
But
either
way
,
I
had
put
most
of
my
hopes
into
Cooper
and
didn’t
get
anything
in
return
.
I
was
pretty
sure
I
was
about
to
be
rejected
by
both
SLGs
I
had
spent
the
previous
two
weeks
getting
to
know
and
love
.
As
if
my
thoughts
about
SLGs
had
summoned
them
,
two
upperclassmen
from
Brownstone
approached
me
and
asked
how
I
was
doing
.
I
lied
and
went
with
a
neutral
good
.
I
don’t
remember
what
we
talked
about
,
but
I
do
remember
noticing
how
cheerful
both
of
them
seemed
.
It
was
Shooters
,
after
all
,
so
alcohol
and
the
atmosphere
could’ve
explained
a
little
.
But
I
also
knew
that
Brownstone
had
finished
its
deliberations
earlier
that
day
and
made
their
final
cuts
.
I
wondered
if
they
were
giving
me
a
hint
.
Still
a
little
thrown
off
by
getting
rejected
by
Cooper
,
I
had
to
admit
to
them
that
I
couldn’t
remember
their
names
.
nbsp
;
They
seemed
so
excited
to
see
me
,
and
I
felt
guilty
.
nbsp
;
It
suddenly
felt
like
I
deserved
what
I
got
from
Cooper
.
Why
should
I
get
a
spot
in
an
SLG
when
I’m
not
even
capable
of
remembering
people
?
But
the
question
that
kept
bouncing
around
my
head
was
whether
or
not
they
were
inadvertently
or
otherwise
giving
me
a
clue
about
my
fate
in
Brownstone
.
I
went
back
to
my
dorm
and
told
my
roommate
about
my
day
.
As
I
worried
about
Brownstone
and
tried
to
brush
off
Cooper
,
he
worried
about
Maxwell
.
I
got
a
call
from
Brownstone
congratulating
me
the
next
day
,
and
re
read
my
email
from
Cooper
that
also
stipulated
that
I
was
extended
the
opportunity
to
be
placed
on
a
very
short
waitlist
.
I
ended
up
joining
Brownstone
with
a
few
of
my
close
friends
,
and
I
don’t
regret
the
way
things
turned
out
for
even
a
minute
.
Rush
was
fun
for
me
,
but
bid
day
was
confusing
,
disappointing
,
and
stressful
.
I
can’t
remember
having
felt
so
conflicted
in
my
entire
life
.
Because
rush
was
so
confusing
for
me
,
I’d
like
to
create
a
rush
FAQ
for
first
years
who
may
be
as
lost
as
I
was
.
Stressed
by
demanding
workloads
,
job
searches
and
social
pressures
,
college
students
,
including
many
of
those
on
Duke’s
campus
,
are
vulnerable
to
deteriorating
mental
health
.
However
,
another
major
factor
that
seems
to
be
exacerbating
the
issue
is
the
ubiquitous
obsession
with
social
media
.
A
study
published
by
the
American
Psychiatric
Association
in
November
of
2018
found
that
college
students
have
increasingly
utilized
campus
services
to
alleviate
mental
health
issues
over
the
last
ten
years
.
Rates
of
suicide
and
depression
increased
,
as
did
lifetime
diagnoses
of
a
mental
health
condition
.
Some
evidence
indicates
that
social
media
may
be
a
key
factor
in
increasing
rates
of
depression
.
A
University
of
Pennsylvania
study
found
that
,
limiting
social
media
use
to
approximately
30
minutes
per
day
may
lead
to
significant
improvement
in
well
being
.
According
to
Pew
Research
Center
,
88
percent
of
18
to
29
year
olds
use
some
form
of
social
media
,
outranking
every
other
age
demographic
in
terms
of
social
media
consumption
.
Snapchat
is
among
the
most
popular
platforms
for
teenagers
and
young
adults
.
Seventy
eight
percent
of
18
to
24
year
olds
reported
using
the
app
with
71
percent
of
them
visiting
it
multiple
times
per
day
.
In
comparison
,
only
54
percent
of
25
to
29
year
olds
said
they
used
Snapchat
.
As
of
October
of
2018
,
the
app
had
186
million
daily
active
users
.
You
don’t
have
to
look
at
these
numbers
to
know
that
Snapchat
is
beginning
to
dominate
our
lives
.
Go
no
farther
than
any
Duke
basketball
game
,
fraternity
party
,
or
lunch
with
friends
at
the
Brodhead
Center
to
see
students
mesmerized
by
Snap
stories
and
determined
to
send
pictures
via
the
app
.
The
unfortunate
reality
is
that
heavy
use
of
social
media
,
particularly
Snapchat
,
has
been
linked
to
mental
illness
.
The
good
news
some
young
people
are
starting
to
notice
it
.
A
2017
survey
by
the
Royal
Society
for
Public
Health
found
that
Britons
ages
14
24
believe
that
social
media
outlets
harm
their
wellbeing
.
Although
citing
positive
effects
of
social
media
such
as
building
self
identity
and
self
expression
,
many
also
said
that
platforms
like
Twitter
,
Instagram
and
Snapchat
exacerbate
anxiety
,
sleep
deprivation
and
depression
.
According
to
the
survey
,
Snapchat
in
particular
was
noted
to
evoke
a
strong
negative
response
when
it
comes
to
creating
worries
about
fear
of
missing
out
,
or
FOMO
.
This
makes
sense
given
the
amount
of
time
many
us
spend
looking
at
stories
,
which
typically
are
videos
and
photos
of
our
friends’
activities
.
Sharing
the
fun
parts
of
our
day
to
friends
may
seem
innocent
;
yet
we
all
know
the
lonely
and
unhappy
feeling
we
get
seeing
them
have
that
fun
without
us
.
The
image
focus
of
Snapchat
may
also
create
feelings
of
inadequacy
as
it
relates
to
how
we
look
,
reducing
our
self
confidence
.
Even
though
each
Snap
is
essentially
a
few
seconds
,
we
somehow
find
a
way
to
spend
on
average
40
minutes
a
day
using
the
app
that
could
likely
go
toward
more
productive
activities
.
Addiction
to
viewing
Snapchat
stories
is
not
only
time
consuming
,
but
also
illogical
.
Why
would
we
want
to
invest
so
much
time
wondering
about
what
other
people
are
up
to
?
We
should
be
prioritizing
the
events
that
are
within
our
control
that
can
contribute
to

Snapchat
stories
,
and
even
regular
Snaps
to
some
extent

depict
a
false
reality
.
The
purpose
of
the
app
is
to
record
the
events
of
your
day
and
share
it
publicly
to
your

However
,
our
ability
to
select

moments
of

leads
to
bias
in
picking

moments

moments
that

off

Thus
,
when
viewing
Snaps
and
watching
stories
,
we
are
often
comparing
ourselves
to
a
misrepresentation
of

Unfortunately
,
we
buy
into

of

we

You
are
so
worried
about
showing
people
a
moment
and
creating
a
certain
perception
of
yourself
that
you
don’t
even
fully
live
that
moment
.
It’s
ridiculous
.
It
is
understandable
to
send
pictures
that
are
truly
valuable
for
communicating
with

However
,
it
is
important
to
take
time
to
enjoy
the
presence
of
friends
and
family
rather
than
be
emotionally
disconnected
from
the
present
trying
to
impress
people
absorbed

Your

should
focus
on
you

and
not

only
to

Cherish

when

Coming
home
for
winter
break
after
completing
just
one
semester
at
Duke
means
being
peppered
with
endless
questions
about
my
future
from
dear
relatives
and
friends
.
The
most
popular
question
of
them
all
being
When
I
say
that
I
am
undecided
,
I
watch
as
a
cloud
of
grave
concern
descends
upon
them
,
pity
plastered
all
over
their
faces
.
Well
meaning
,
or
so
I
presume
,
their
syrupy
sweet
voices
quickly
assure
me
,
Oh
,
don’t
worry
!
You
still
have
time
to
decide
.
I
nod
in
feigned
agreement
,
longing
to
ward
off
any
further
questions
on
how
I’m
planning
to
spend
the
next
three
and
a
half
years
of
my
lavish
Duke
education
.
After
several
beats
of
awkward
silence
,
conversation
quickly
melts
away
and
I
plan
my
escape
.
As
well
as
grappling
with
invasive
questions
that
evoke
preordainment
,
I
also
watched
an
endless
stream
of
TED
Talks
over
winter
break
,
as
one
does
to
keep
those
neurons
firing
before
they
have
the
chance
to
hibernate
.
Amid
my
TED
Talk
marathon
,
I
stumbled
upon
Emilie
Wapnick’s
talk
Why
some
of
us
don't
have
one
true
calling
.
Wapnick
depicted
the
struggle
of
multipotentialites
,
a
group
of
individuals
defined
by
their
breadth
.
Cherishing
the
idea
of
the
Renaissance
Student
,
he
believes
that
you
have
the
choice
of
demonstrating
your
expertise
via
becoming
very
good
at
one
specific
skill
,
or
becoming
knowledgeable
about
many
skills
.
And
I
couldn’t
agree
more
.
A
Duke
degree
opens
doors
;
there’s
no
doubt
about
it
.
However
,
the
current
culture
stifles
the
modern
Renaissance
Student
.
For
the
sake
of
measuring
up
to
our
peers
,
we
sacrifice
curiosity
and
exploration
in
the
never
ending
rat
race
to
acquire
success
and
financial
security
.
These
are
understandable
constraints
,
but
they
aren’t
the
end
all
be
all
.
In
fact
,
the
very
framework
of
Duke’s
curriculum
is
uniquely
equipped
to
accommodate
us
,
in
spite
of
the
general
culture’s
proclivity
to
specialization
,
providing
a
vast
terrain
of
intellectual
freedom
and
resources
.
Thinking
back
to
my
winter
break
,
I
always
want
to
fire
back
at
my
interrogators
rather
than
plot
a
quick
getaway
and
remark
that
innovation
and
creativity
aren’t
shackled
by
the
chains
of
specialization
,
rather
,
they
intersect
at
the
overlaps
between
different
ideas
and
disciplines
.
However
,
I
hold
back
.
I
realize
that
a
multidisciplinary
approach
is
just
one
way
to
view
the
world
,
and
they
are
completely
entitled
to
theirs
.
And
I
also
realize
that
polymaths
need
their
specializing
peers
,
and
vice
versa
in
order
to
solve
complex
world
problems
.
I’d
like
to
think
that
the
modern
Renaissance
Student
isn’t
dead
.
So
maybe
the
lot
of
us
can
grab
a
coffee
sometime
?
I
promise
I
won’t
ask
you
what
your
major
is
.
Turning
down
Heavenly
Buffaloes
in
favor
of
Marketplace
,
looking
underdressed
and
off
theme
at
a
frat
party
,
sparsely
decorating
your
dorm
room
these
small
sacrifices
seemingly
minor
can
take
a
social
toll
on
financially
disadvantaged
students
when
spending
is
so
deeply
ingrained
in
Duke
culture
.
When
you
go
to
a
school
where
69
percent
of
students
come
from
families
in
the
top
20
percent
,
it
makes
sense
it’s
just
the
culture
.
I’m
one
of
those
students
.
The
summer
before
my
senior
year
I
bussed
and
waitressed
at
a
Mexican
American
restaurant
in
my
hometown
.
Working
upwards
of
50
hours
a
week
and
getting
paid
only
in
tips
,
I
busted
my
has
caught
me
at
Devine’s
,
that’s
for
sure
.
I’m
an
extrovert
and
the
type
of
person
who
loves
the
energy
that
comes
with
going
out
and
partying
.
While
my
finances
have
benefited
,
I
don’t
know
if
it
was
worth
it
and
what
,
if
anything
,
I
can
do
to
find
a
middle
ground
.
The
financial
aid
that
Duke
provides
its
low
income
students
is
generous
and
is
the
sole
reason
why
I
and
many
others
can
afford
to
attend
this
school
.
But
often
,
people
unaffected
by
financial
constraints
are
ignorant
of
the
extraneous
costs
that
go
into
succeeding
here
,
both
academically
and
experientially
.
I
have
thought
long
and
hard
about
what
advice
,
if
any
,
I
can
give
in
closing
but
in
all
honesty
,
none
of
it
seems
genuine
.
I
cannot
ask
my
peers
to
give
up
on
their
nights
out
if
they
have
the
means
to
fund
it
,
and
I
cannot
ask
you
to
take
pity
on
your
less
privileged
friends
.
nbsp
;
The
only
realistic
solution
that
I
can
see
is
for
those
of
you
reading
this
to
try
to
be
cognizant
of
the
privileges
you
are
afforded
by
coming
from
families
that
fund
your
Duke
experience
.
Yes
,
education
is
by
and
large
the
most
important
aspect
of
college
but
it’s
not
the
only
thing
that
plays
into
your
success
and
happiness
In
a
recent
interview
,
newly
sworn
in
Congresswoman
Alexandria
Ocasio
Cortez
suggested
a
controversial
revision
to
America’s
progressive
tax
code
.
The
modification
she
proposed
raising
the
marginal
tax
rate
to
70
percent
for
high
earners
on
income
over
10
million
was
met
with
alarm
from
top
brass
conservative
lawmakers
and
media
outlets
.
House
Minority
Leader
Steve
Scalise
instigated
a
Twitter
battle
on
the
subject
,
labeling
her
proposal
as
a
way
to
strong
arm
Americans
into
funding
leftist
fantasy
programs
.
Despite
such
a
policy
having
broad
support
from
Americans
,
leading
economists
like
Paul
Krugman
and
even
conservative
figures
like
Ann
Coulter
and
Steve
Bannon
,
Ocasio
Cortez
was
slammed
as
batsh
t
insane
and
radical
.
The
controversy
over
Ocasio
Cortez’s
policy
despite
its
historical
precedence
is
just
the
latest
example
of
women
of
color
being
held
to
a
different
standard
of
judgement
and
ridicule
.
Race
and
gender
undeniably
influence
how
seriously
a
person
is
taken
and
how
credible
their
expertise
appears
to
others
.
Any
verbal
slip
up
or
serious
policy
pronouncement
from
Ocasio
Cortez
has
been
met
with
relentless
beratement
.
Instead
of
being
seen
as
an
honest
mistake
,
an
out
of
context
mistake
she
made
while
speaking
on
the
three
branches
of
government
was
scandalized
and
an
interpreted
as
an
indictment
of
her
capacity
as
a
lawmaker
.
Meanwhile
,
President
Trump’s
frequent
public
lies
,
numerous
speaking
blunders
and
reliance
on
briefings
from
the
hosts
at
Fox
and
Friends
are
regarded
as
business
as
usual
.
Moreover
,
Paul
Ryan
has
been
lauded
as
a
policy
wonk
and
intellectual
leader
of
the
Republican
party
despite
his
radically
austere
policy
positions
and
the
fact
he
bases
his
political
ideology
off
of
novels
written
by
Ayn
Rand
a
woman
who
spent
her
final
years
collecting
assistance
from
government
programs
she
branded
fit
only
for
parasites
.
Despite
Ocasio
Cortez’s
policy
prescriptions
having
support
from
not
only
her
constituents
but
also
large
swaths
of
Americans
,
she
is
already
facing
blowback
from
even
Democratic
colleagues
.
Senator
Claire
McCaskill
and
former
Senator
Joe
Lieberman
have
publicly
called
for
her
to
fall
in
line
and
rein
in
her
firebrand
behavior
.
This
exemplifies
yet
another
privilege
that
is
not
afforded
to
women
of
color
.
While
John
McCain
was
lauded
for
being
a
maverick
despite
constantly
capitulating
to
establishment
neoconservatives
,
mavericks
who
happen
to
be
progressive
women
are
deemed
disorderly
and
radical
.
Another
recent
example
of
this
in
politics
include
Congresswoman
Rashida
Tlaib
,
who
called
Trump
a
motherf
cker
and
earned
herself
a
top
spot
in
cable
news
coverage
.
In
fact
,
her
remark
was
covered
five
times
more
than
Steve
King’s
embrace
of
the
term
white
supremacy
.
Being
a
victim
of
gendered
attacks
and
doubt
is
a
phenomenon
not
exclusive
to
Ocasio
Cortez
;
rather
,
being
held
to
a
different
evaluative
criteria
is
something
that
marginalized
people
deal
with
on
a
daily
basis
in
all
types
of
settings
.
At
Duke
and
other
universities
,
people
of
color
and
women
across
racial
backgrounds
are
constantly
evaluated
in
a
way
that
their
white
or
male
peers
are
not
.
For
students
,
this
manifests
frequently
in
affirmative
action
complaints
that
argue
white
candidates
are
robbed
of
college
acceptances
by
less
qualified
applicants
of
color
.
For
faculty
and
graduate
students
,
this
often
manifests
in
evaluation
discrepancies
;
numerous
studies
have
consistently
shown
how
non
white
,
non
male
professors
received
statistically
worse
performance
reviews
,
regardless
of
their
teaching
ability
.
The
case
of
Ocasio
Cortez
along
with
countless
other
women
who
have
faced
similar
scrutiny
and
undue
and
skepticism
illustrates
the
societal
equation
of
logic
and
expertise
to
maleness
and
whiteness
.
White
people
particularly
white
men
in
their
capacity
as
laborers
,
homemakers
,
leaders
and
so
on
are
seen
as
espousing
ideal
qualities
of
objectivity
and
logical
neutrality
.
White
men
have
been
constructed
in
American
mythology
as
untouched
by
bias
,
the
only
true
arbitrators
of
competence
and
aptitude
.
Ocasio
Cortez
represents
a
clash
with
this
mythos
;
her
passion
and
policy
agenda
has
been
met
with
ire
as
a
result
.
If
her
experience
is
any
indicator
,
as
more
women
of
color
continue
to
shake
up
the
good
ol’
boys’
club
in
Washington
,
pushback
from
establishment
types
rooted
in
sexism
and
racism
will
only
grow
more
prevalent
.
In
the
past
few
years
,
anti
politically
correct
PC
movements
have
grown
in
popularity
and
vigor
.
Groups
of
young
college
conservatives
have
criticized
the
liberal
hold
on
universities
and
conservative
activists
have
mocked
censorship
and
sensitivity
among
young
millennials
.
The
sentiment
that
people
get
offended
by
anything
these
days
seems
to
be
growing
among
the
larger
population
.
Scandals
of
comedians
getting
booted
from
gigs
for
racially
insensitive
remarks
or
being
fired
from
hosting
an
awards
ceremony
due
to
old
homophobic
tweets
have
sparked
discussion
over
whether
PC
culture
has
gone
too
far
.
Even
at
Duke
,
students
and
professors
complain
about
the
PC
culture
on
campus
.
Politically
correct
means
non
offensive
and
non
controversial
.
As
racial
minorities
and
niches
of
LGBT
communities
gain
political
clout
,
the
amount
of
identity
factors
that
we
are
exposed
to
increases
.
Some
appreciate
this
diversity
,
while
others
see
this
diversity
as
more
people
they
can’t
offend
.
The
anti
PC
culture
of
arguing
that
people
get
offended
too
easily
shifts
blame
on
an
individual’s
surroundings
,
and
away
from
the
individual
who
was
offensive
or
careless
with
their
words
.
It
makes
political
correctness
seem
like
society’s
flaw
,
and
that
the
individual
holds
no
responsibility
for
their
words
and
how
their
words
make
people
feel
.
I
view
political
correctness
as
an
opportunity
to
connect
to
a
broader
range
of
people
.
I
do
not
see
it
as
a
restriction
.
My
life
experiences
have
not
specifically
taught
me
the
struggles
of
other
racial
,
sexual
,
and
gender
minorities
.
However
,
I
do
know
respectful
language
,
or
PC
terms
,
that
members
of
certain
communities
ask
outsiders
to
use
.
In
an
institution
such
as
Duke
,
we
are
surrounded
by
an
extremely
diverse
population
.
Through
being
politically
correct
,
I
can
make
my
words
accessible
to
and
respectful
of
a
larger
amount
of
my
peers
at
Duke
,
instead
of
solely
people
with
similar
life
experiences
to
mine
.
Being
ignorant
to
different
identities
shuts
out
people
from
hearing
your
message
,
and
it
dwindles
your
audience
.
A
few
weeks
ago
,
Kevin
Hart
was
dropped
from
his
hosting
gig
at
the
Oscars
due
to
a
resurfacing
of
tweets
using
the
word
f
g
as
well
as
a
joke
about
him
beating
his
son
up
with
a
dollhouse
if
he
turned
out
to
be
gay
.
Many
,
including
Ellen
DeGeneres
,
defended
the
comedian
,
arguing
that
these
were
old
jokes
from
years
ago
.
The
issue
was
not
that
society
had
somehow
decided
to
be
offended
by
Kevin
Hart
.
Rather
,
Kevin
Hart
decided
in
those
years
to
exclude
gay
people
from
his
audience
by
making
them
the
target
of
those
jokes
.
He
lost
that
community
as
a
potential
fan
base
as
a
direct
result
of
his
choice
to
make
homophobic
comments
.
When
I
was
in
middle
school
,
I
said
plenty
of
offensive
things
.
I
pushed
boundaries
and
ignored
political
correctness
often
.
But
then
I
grew
up
.
I
learned
about
the
experiences
of
people
different
me
.
And
I
didn’t
become
politically
correct
because
society
or
this
liberal
university
pressured
me
,
but
because
I
gained
more
empathy
for
certain
communities
.
I
dropped
about
10
12
words
from
vocabulary
,
including
words
like
retarded
and
ghetto
.
I
have
not
lost
any
ability
to
communicate
my
ideas
or
thoughts
from
my
political
correctness
.
I
still
make
mistakes
,
but
with
good
intentions
I
never
feel
like
I
have
to
worry
.
I
understand
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
use
the
correct
vocabulary
in
an
academic
environment
focused
on
social
justice
.
I
also
believe
that
criticisms
of
political
correctness
are
borne
out
of
a
nostalgia
for
past
eras
where
racist
,
sexist
and
homophobic
comment
were
more
commonplace
.
It
is
important
for
us
to
take
ownership
of
our
words
,
and
understand
that
our
message
reaches
the
audiences
we
choose
for
it
.
I
don’t
want
people
to
monitor
their
language
to
fit
within
a
societal
rule
book
.
Instead
,
I
want
us
to
understand
the
perspective
of
affinity
groups
and
learn
how
our
words
impact
their
communities
.
This
way
,
we
can
implement
socially
conscious
language
from
a
genuine
desire
to
be
more
respectful
,
rather
than
an
obligation
to
adhere
to
a
set
of
rules
.
Learning
to
be
non
offensive
takes
patience
.
People
will
get
angry
at
you
for
things
you
have
been
saying
for
your
entire
life
.
Instead
of
resorting
to
defensiveness
,
try
to
understand
where
their
anger
is
coming
from
.
For
minority
groups
,
this
anger
can
come
directly
from
life
experiences
.
It
takes
a
strong
will
to
step
back
and
realize
that
what
you
have
said
is
truly
hurtful
,
and
it
is
easy
to
dismiss
others’
anger
as
a
societal
flaw
.
But
when
you
learn
to
re
evaluate
your
words
in
that
way
,
you
expand
your
own
opportunities
for
knowledge
.
Business

Mankind
was

The
common
welfare
was
my
business
;
charity
,

,
forbearance
,
and
benevolence
,
were
,
all
,
my
business

The
dealings
of
my

were

the
comprehensive
ocean
of
my
business
!
’
I
am
reminded
of
this
line
Marley
roars
at
Scrooge
in
Charles
Dickens’
because
a
few
days
ago
I
received
some
very
bad
advice
.
Who
wants
to
hear
a
student’s
views
on
anything
outside
the
Duke
Bubble
,
someone
insisted
,
when
the
Duke
Bubble
is
the
only
thing
students
really
know
?
Here
is
my
answer
because
it
does
not
matter
whether
anyone
listens
.
What
matters
is
that
we
care
.
What
matters
is
that
we
develop
a
habit
of
caring
and
carry
those
cares
into
action
.
We
owe
more
to
the
species
than
the
satisfaction
of
our
own
concerns
.
Good
people
and
bad
people
do
not
hatch
at
middle
age
they
become
so
over
time
.
The
next
time
you
see
some
big
problem
,
ask
yourself
this
.
Does
the
problem
exist
because
the
System
just
is
that
way
,
or
does
the
problem
exist
because
people
like
us
never
bothered
to
really
try
to
fix
it
?
Consider
sexism
and
elitism
.
There’s
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
rush
lately
do
it
and
don’t
do
it
,
it’s
problematic
and
it’s
not
.
What
is
more
likely
that
the
gods
deigned
to
descend
Olympus
and
punish
our
hubris
with
irreparable
exclusivity
and
toxic
genderedness
,
or
that
base
people
will
misuse
any
system
they
find
to
achieve
their
base
ends
?
Are
these
problems
brute
facts
,
or
the
result
of
collective
failures
failures
to
push
back
against
that
one
person
who
always
makes
crass
jokes
,
to
choose
the
high
road
over
fitting
in
?
Consider
exploitation
.
Consider
the
ubiquitous
Nike
Swoosh
on
your
feet
and
on
someone
else’s
back
and
on
no
small
part
of
what
Duke
Athletics
hands
out
.
Do
we
not
appreciate
the
very
cruel
irony
of
protesting
the
legacies
of
the
historical
exploitation
of
people
of
color
,
while
possibly
wearing
kit
produced
by
the
present
day
exploitation
of
people
of
color
?
Or
is
avoiding
ethically
dubious
brands
beyond
my
responsibility
,
because
all
I
know
is
the
Duke
bubble
?
Consider
labor
.
We
are
rightly
incensed
when
Duke’s
staff
are
mistreated
.
But
how
often
do
we
treat
the
people
who
keep
our
spaces
livable
like
the
help
,
passing
by
them
in
silence
with
eyes
down
?
Is
Thank
you
a
word
said
in
West
Union
that
often
?
Are
we
so
proud
that
we
campaigned
for
a
higher
minimum
wage
,
when
we
fail
to
give
those
earning
it
no
more
than
minimum
respect
?
We
gush
about
our
liberal
principles
,
but
are
time
and
time
again
unable
or
unwilling
to
put
them
into
practice
.
These
are
but
a
few
of
our
failings
,
the
more
conspicuous
I
can
note
.
The
list
goes
on
.
If
you
want
to
see
what
the
future
will
be
,
take
one
day
and
see
how
often
we
fail
to
live
our
beliefs
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
there
are
not
many
groups
and
individuals
on
this
campus
who
are
doing
what
is
in
their
power
to
do
to
live
out
their
beliefs
for
the
good
.
This
is
not
to
say
that
some
of
us
,
for
one
reason
or
another
,
cannot
do
anything
more
than
keep
ourselves
here
.
This
is
to
say
that
there
is
still
a
wide
gap
between
what
we
deeply
believe
and
how
we
nbsp
;
daily
act
.
nbsp
;
If
we
do
not
actively
seek
to
improve
our
own
house
,
how
can
we
hope
to
be
anything
but
incompetent
in
solving
the
more
and
worse
problems
that
exist
beyond
our
gothic
paradise
?
If
you
want
to
change
the
future
,
change
what
is
here
and
change
what
is
now
.
Find
whatever
problem
you
care
about
,
be
it
sexism
or
exploitation
or
labor
or
anything
at
all
.
Find
what
you
can
do
,
here
and
now
,
to
fix
that
problem
.
Train
yourself
to
be
the
sort
of
person
who
can
keep
fixing
that
problem
.
Do
you
want
to
increase
access
to
education
?
Join
a
club
that
does
so
.
Do
you
want
to
increase
food
security
?
Worry
less
about
who
makes
the
best
fry
on
campus
,
and
more
about
what
you
can
do
to
help
local
food
banks
servicing
Durham’s
food
desert
.
You
will
not
change
the
world
for
the
better
if
you
cannot
change
yourself
for
the
better
.
If
you
do
not
live
your
beliefs
in
the
small
things
,
you
will
not
live
your
beliefs
in
the
large
things
.
Yes
,
The
World
seems
far
away
.
Yes
,
we
seem
very
small
actors
on
its
stage
.
But
the
only
way
to
being
making
change
is
to
make
change
where
we
can
and
as
we
can
.
I
close
with
a
paraphrase
of
G
.
K
.
Chesterton
.
Our
beliefs
have
,
in
the
main
,
not
been
found
wanting
.
They
have
been
found
difficult
and
not
tried
.
How
will
we
change
the
world
,
if
we
will
not
change
something
small
?

Beware
of
The
Plastics
.
We
can
thank
Janice
from
Mean
Girls
for
spelling
out
the
social
scene
at
North
Shore
High
.
I
went
to
high
school
at
New
Trier
on
the
North
Shore
of
Chicago
,
the
school
that
the
movie
is
based
upon
.
Leaving
the
North
Shore
,
I
was
ready
to
experience
the
rich
diversity
and
integration
that
sold
me
on
Duke
.
Ironically
,
this
cafeteria
map
resembles
Duke’s
social
scene
more
than
it
does
my
high
school
cafeteria
.
Sad
,
right
?
In
my
third
year
at
Duke
,
I
feel
like
a
veteran
of
Duke’s
social
stratification
.
I
have
been
an
athlete
for
over
two
years
and
was
too
injured
to
continue
competing
.
I
have
lost
friends
to
sororities
as
they
became
too
cool
for
me
.
I
have
been
rejected
by
a
selective
living
group
.
Even
after
finding
a
plethora
of
amazing
humans
I
get
to
call
my
friends
,
the
question
stills
racks
my
brain
,
So
,
who
are
the
GDIs
?
Those
who
aren’t
in
Greek
life
,
an
SLG
or
a
varsity
sport
.
Roughly
34
percent
of
Duke
undergraduates
are
in
Greek
life
,
16
percent
are
in
SLGs
,
and
10
percent
are
athletes
.
If
my
math
is
correct
,
and
bear
with
me
because
I’m
in
the
social
sciences
,
58
percent
of
Duke
student
are
affiliated
,
leaving
42
percent
independent
.
Moreover
,
before
I
dive
into
this
,
I
want
to
acknowledge
my
privileged
position
as
a
white
,
cisgender
female
.
I
can
only
imagine
the
social
experience
for
those
with
different
backgrounds
and
identities
.
Before
I
make
any
enemies
I
understand
the
appeal
of
Greek
life
.
You
have
a
community
,
an
automatic
group
of
friends
,
a
sense
of
identity
on
campus
and
a
social
life
mapped
out
for
you
.
Regardless
,
it
was
never
an
option
in
my
mind
.
I
already
went
to
high
school
surrounded
by
wealthy
white
people
like
myself
,
and
I
wasn’t
seeking
more
homogeneity
.
Furthermore
,
I
did
not
see
a
reason
to
willingly
submit
myself
to
a
needless
social
hierarchy
and
allow
myself
to
be
subject
to
scrutiny
from
people
I
may
not
even
like
.
Conformity
,
rape
culture
,
gender
essentialism
,
emphasis
on
physical
appearance
,
racial
tokenism
,
hierarchy
,
heteronormativity
pass
.
Nonetheless
,
Greek
life
seems
to
have
the
power
to
make
you
feel
excluded
from
a
group
that
you
don’t
even
want
to
be
a
part
of
.
Its
presence
on
campus
is
hard
to
ignore
and
can
easily
make
independents
feel
as
though
they
lie
on
the
social
fringes
of
campus
.
During
first
semester
as
a
third
year
,
campus
felt
different
,
because
so
many
Greek
students
were
abroad
.
.
.
To
be
frank
,
campus
had
never
felt
like
such
a
socially
open
and
welcoming
place
.
Selective
Living
Groups
SLGs
have
a
lot
of
the
positive
aspects
of
Greek
life
a
community
of
friends
,
a
group
to
party
with
,
and
an
identity
on
campus
.
They
are
known
to
be
far
less
problematic
than
Greek
life
,
as
they
tend
to
be
nbsp
;
more
diverse
,
affordable
,
and
reflective
of
the
racial
and
socio
economic
demographic
of
Duke’s
campus
.
With
Greek
life
having
such
a
dominant
presence
on
campus
,
it
makes
sense
that
people
outside
of
it
would
want
to
foster
communities
of
their
own
.
However
,
as
a
result
,
Duke’s
social
scene
is
further
stratified
,
with
more
and
more
emphasis
on
group
affiliation
.
Meanwhile
,
the
athlete
community
is
a
world
of
its
own
that
is
fairly
separate
from
the
non
athlete
or
narp
community
.
This
is
in
part
due
to
the
demanding
schedule
of
a
varsity
athlete
that
can
leave
little
time
to
engage
with
the
world
outside
of
athletics
and
academics
,
and
in
part
due
to
the
close
knit
team
dynamics
that
cause
athletes
to
stick
together
.
The
social
scene
extends
beyond
the
individual
teams
and
exists
as
a
network
,
with
relationships
among
various
teams
and
a
strong
sense
of
community
to
which
I
am
grateful
to
be
a
part
of
.
Although
this
is
not
an
affiliation
in
the
sense
of
rushing
and
choosing
a
group
,
it
is
a
community
and
identity
on
this
campus
parallel
to
communities
and
identities
from
SLGs
and
Greek
life
.
While
I
myself
am
not
fully
independent
because
of
athletics
,
many
of
my
closest
friends
are
full
fledged
GDIs
.
As
third
years
,
they
have
made
their
own
communities
and
molded
their
Duke
experiences
into
what
they
want
them
to
be
.
Many
independents
echo
the
same
feeling
as
myself
,
that
it
was
a
long
road
to
get
where
we
are
now
.
To
any
independents
,
especially
underclassmen
,
that
feel
isolated
,
know
that
there
are
so
many
rich
friendships
and
communities
of
people
to
be
fostered
.
Duke’s
campus
is
filled
with
some
of
the
most
brilliant
and
kind
people
you
will
ever
meet
.
However
,
it
often
seems
like
campus
is
filled
with
the
most
brilliant
and
kind
people
that
you
will
never
meet
.
I
understand
that
it
is
so
much
easier
to
have
a
community
that
is
already
made
for
you
and
join
a
pre
existing
group
of
friends
.
However
,
it
has
felt
so
much
more
meaningful
to
have
organically
created
a
network
of
friendships
.
Best
friends
don’t
need
to
come
from
a
bid
,
they
can
come
from
Stat
101
,
the
Sazón
line
or
the
Shooters
bathroom
.
While
the
independent
experience
can
feel
lonely
and
intimidating
,
know
that
your
time
here
can
be
the
rich
and
diverse
experience
that
you
hoped
for
when
you
chose
Duke
.
Duke
students
will
move
into
Krzyzewskiville
Saturday
for
the
start
of
black
tenting
.
As
a
senior
who
hasn’t
tented
before
,
this
tenting
season
was
my
last
chance
to
endure
the
frosty
temperatures
,
complain
endlessly
about
how
much
I
don’t
want
to
sleep
in
a
tent
tonight
,
and
forge
friendships
through
a
shared
suffering
.
As
ludicrous
I
think
tenting
actually
is
,
here
I
am
,
a
K
Ville
resident
.
Tenting
is
the
least
productive
activity
I
do
,
but
it
also
takes
the
highest
priority
.
At
the
beginning
of
the
semester
,
I
had
allocated
time
on
my
weekly
calendar
to
go
to
Wilson
and
pursue
personal
electronics
projects
,
both
of
which
have
now
been
woefully
neglected
.
Yet
,
I
go
to
my
tent
shift
more
punctually
than
I
attend
class
,
and
even
structure
the
rest
of
my
day
around
it
.
And
it’s
just
as
difficult
to
do
work
in
the
tent
as
I
imagined
.
While
I
realize
how
unwise
it
is
to
reserve
some
of
my
work
for
my
tent
shifts
,
I
do
it
anyway
.
I’ll
arrive
to
my
tent
shift
,
sit
on
the
floor
on
a
pile
of
pillows
and
sleeping
bags
,
and
eventually
get
a
little
too
comfortable
.
The
drowsiness
hits
,
and
I
ponder
how
nice
a
nap
would
be
,
and
besides
,
my
shift
doesn’t
end
for
another
2
.
5
hours
.
I
don’t
bother
to
set
an
alarm
,
and
next
thing
I
know
it’s
gotten
cold
and
dark
and
I
don’t
want
to
leave
the
warmth
of
my
sleeping
bag
.
Well
,
I
guess
I’m
browsing
my
phone
for
the
next
hour
of
my
shift
,
and
my
Biophotonics
lab
report
will
have
to
wait
until
after
dinner
.
I’ve
heard
from
people
that
if
I
tent
,
my
grades
will
drop
,
or
at
minimum
I
will
struggle
to
maintain
the
same
level
of
grades
.
Unwilling
to
test
the
veracity
of
those
claims
,
I
put
tenting
off
until
senior
year
.
It
did
seem
quite
unappealing
to
do
an
ECE110
problem
set
in
the
dark
,
with
my
fingers
freezing
,
or
to
do
my
programming
assignment
for
ECE250
with
my
laptop
battery
draining
in
the
cold
and
no
outlet
to
charge
,
or
to
go
to
class
tired
after
having
been
woken
up
multiple
times
in
the
middle
of
the
night
for
tent
checks
.
To
be
fair
,
it’s
difficult
for
me
to
judge
how
difficult
it
actually
is
to
do
work
in
a
tent
,
because
as
a
part
timing
senior
,
I
now
have
little
work
to
begin
with
and
no
sense
of
urgency
to
avoid
procrastination
.
While
many
have
no
issue
excelling
academically
while
tenting
,
I
think
it
would
have
been
quite
stressful
for
me
had
I
tented
in
previous
years
.
I’ve
also
heard
from
people
that
college
grades
don’t
matter
as
much
as
high
school
grades
,
and
at
first
I
believed
them
.
After
all
,
when
I
got
to
Duke
,
I
thought
to
myself
I’ve
made
it
;
courses
might
be
challenging
,
but
competing
against
other
Duke
students
,
average
will
be
a
decent
accomplishment
in
and
of
itself
.
This
isn’t
saying
I
didn’t
care
about
my
grades
I
had
an
underwhelming
first
semester
,
and
tried
a
little
bit
harder
each
following
semester
to
bring
my
grades
up
.
The
success
of
my
efforts
was
quite
limited
,
but
in
the
process
I
didn’t
let
myself
tent
because
I
wanted
to
have
better
grades
.
It
wasn’t
until
end
of
sophomore
year
when
I
realized
how
untrue
that
grades
don’t
matter
as
much
actually
was
.
After
fall
and
spring
recruiting
seasons
rolled
around
,
many
of
my
fellow
sophomore
friends
had
internships
.
Wanting
the
same
,
I
spent
countless
hours
applying
online
to
various
internship
postings
,
and
received
more
rejection
emails
than
Piazza
notifications
.
Wondering
how
my
other
friends
did
it
,
I
soon
realized
a
common
thread
among
them
they
all
had
GPAs
higher
than
3
.
9
.
Mine
wasn’t
even
close
.
I
realized
how
difficult
it
was
to
stand
out
amongst
the
hordes
of
qualified
individuals
juniors
seeking
internships
with
more
classes
and
experience
under
their
belt
,
with
the
added
bonus
of
able
to
receive
full
time
return
offers
,
as
well
as
the
sophomores
who
,
like
me
had
little
experience
,
had
higher
GPAs
and
demonstrated
that
they
were
hard
working
enough
through
their
grades
.
My
grades
were
mediocre
,
I
didn’t
have
any
desirable
skills
,
and
,
well
,
I
wasn’t
competitive
.
It
was
a
harsh
reality
.
Having
passed
on
tenting
twice
,
I
was
confused
I
didn’t
tent
,
but
my
grades
that
semester
looked
like
I
did
.
In
my
junior
year
,
I
finally
figured
out
how
to
study
,
and
wasn’t
going
to
let
tenting
get
in
the
way
of
my
new
upward
trend
,
and
again
,
passed
on
tenting
.
Senior
spring
rolled
around
,
now
only
one
class
from
graduating
,
and
at
the
point
where
grades
no
longer
matter
,
I
was
finally
ready
to
tent
.
Tenting
is
both
enjoyable
yet
miserable
,
and
I’m
glad
I
finally
decided
to
tent
.
I
realize
that
obviously
the
Duke
UNC
game
is
important
,
but
it’s
also
about
the
process
getting
there
the
mutual
endurance
of
black
tenting
,
where
we
can
barely
fit
ten
people
in
our
nine
person
tent
;
the
sawing
and
hammering
to
build
an
over
engineered
platform
for
our
tent
;
and
the
conversation
I’ve
made
with
the
people
in
my
tent
that
I’ve
seen
around
for
years
but
haven’t
talked
to
.
But
of
course
,
most
everyone
knows
this
already
;
it
isn’t
some
groundbreaking
revelation
.
I
do
wonder
what
other
experiences
and
friendships
I
might
have
developed
had
I
tented
in
my
other
years
.
Who
would
win
in
a
fight
between
Zion
Williamson
and
my
GPA
?
What
a
silly
question
,
and
there’s
no
real
answer
unless
I’m
able
to
peek
into
alternate
universes
where
numbers
can
also
play
basketball
.
But
as
an
intellectual
exercise
,
had
I
tented
the
first
three
years
of
my
college
career
,
my
GPA
might
have
taken
a
hit
like
Syracuse’s
Mark
Dolezaj
did
against
Zion
Williamson
.
Me
Let’s
get
dinner
this
week
.
Friend
Yeah
!
Let
me
check
my
schedule
.
I’m
free
on
Tuesdays
from
4
to
5
30
or
Thursdays
after
8
.
When
are
you
free
?
Me
Well
,
Tuesdays
are
tough
for
me
,
they’re
anything
but
so
let’s
do
Thursday
.
Halfway
through
sophomore
year
,
this
was
the
dialogue
I
ran
through
whenever
I
tried
to
schedule
something
with
friends
.
People
were
always
running
off
to
meetings
,
dance
practice
,
group
projects
or
study
sessions
at
all
times
of
the
day
and
night
.
I
decided
that
I
needed
to
do
the
same
.
Free
time
was
akin
to
laziness
,
and
Duke
was
no
place
for
the
lazy
.
While
this
pressure
to
appear
busy
was
partially
responsible
for
my
decision
to
impulsively
fill
up
my
calendar
,
a
larger
force
was
the
nagging
voice
in
the
back
of
my
head
.
Former
president
Richard
Brodhead’s
voice
,
to
be
exact
.
In
his
convocation
address
to
my
class
in
2016
,
Brodhead
said
something
that
has
been
etched
in
my
mind
ever
since
Passive
citizenship
has
no
place
at
Duke
.
For
this
place
to
work
,
you
have
a
responsibility
to
participate
.
Of
course
,
by
participation
,
he
meant
partaking
in
deep
discussions
,
asking
hard
questions
,
and
seeking
out
mentors
in
order
to
challenge
truths
and
obtain
a
deeper
understanding
of
the
world
.
But
as
a
stressed
out
underclassman
,
I
interpreted
it
as
.
That
led
me
to
join
countless
clubs
that
I
had
no
particular
interest
in
but
which
sounded
cool
and
intellectual
,
to
take
classes
only
because
I
thought
they’d
make
me
more
marketable
,
and
to
do
research
that
wasn’t
in
my
sphere
of
interest
because
,
well
,
everyone
does
research
.
I
quickly
realized
that
the
busier
my
schedule
,
the
more
unhappy
I
was
.
It
wasn’t
long
before
my
calendar
became
the
one
others
had
to
work
around
,
but
despite
my
efforts
to
avoid
passive
citizenship
,
I
had
never
felt
more
unfulfilled
.
My
classes
didn’t
excite
me
,
nor
did
my
extracurriculars
.
In
retrospect
,
sophomore
year
wasn’t
rough
because
of
the
notorious
sophomore
slump
,
but
because
I
wasn’t
doing
things
for
myself
.
It
wasn’t
until
last
semester
that
I
began
to
turn
things
around
.
I
started
working
a
job
that
I
looked
forward
to
everyday
,
and
I
narrowed
down
my
extracurricular
involvement
to
clubs
I
genuinely
enjoyed
.
In
2019
,
I
want
to
do
more
of
that
.
Of
course
,
I
don’t
advocate
that
you
stop
attending
the
classes
you
find
boring
or
that
you
drop
all
of
your
clubs
.
Fill
your
time
with
what
you
find
meaningful
and
important
.
As
I
start
my
second
semester
of
junior
year
,
I
have
come
to
realize
that
my
time
at
Duke
is
fleeting
.
My
four
years
here
will
be
over
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
no
matter
how
long
those
late
night
study
sessions
in
Perkins
may
seem
,
and
that
means
there
is
no
time
to
waste
on
things
that
do
not
bring
me
joy
.
I
know
I
like
to
find
creative
express
myself
,
so
I’ve
dedicated
more
time
to
writing
and
creating
artwork
.
And
I
know
I
don’t
like
working
in
labs
,
so
instead
of
doing
research
in
a
biology
Iab
,
I’ve
started
researching
important
problems
in
policy
.
It’s
a
balance
that
can
be
difficult
to
find
,
but
it’s
one
that
I’m
slowly
beginning
to
reach
.
So
,
yes
,
I
have
a
responsibility
to
participate
.
I
have
a
responsibility
to
be
engaged
on
campus
.
But
that
responsibility
manifests
in
so
many
different
ways
.
It’s
up
to
each
of
us
to
discover
what
that
looks
like
.
I
get
it
.
I
used
to
complain
that
everyone
at
Duke
had
more
money
than
me
,
too
.
But
I
still
have
tons
of
fun
every
weekend
,
even
on
a
budget
.
I
won’t
pretend
to
be
an
extrovert
or
partying
type
,
but
I've
found
that
free
to
spend
money
on
at
Duke
is
laundry
or
off
campus
events
.
I
agree
that
there
are
serious
differences
in
socioeconomic
status
at
Duke
,
and
the
tensions
caused
by
those
were
terrifying
at
first
.
But
just
as
the
more
privileged
students
should
try
to
learn
how
to
be
respectful
of
us
,
we
need
to
learn
how
to
navigate
a
social
life
with
them
without
breaking
our
budgets
.
I’ve
doubled
my
savings
and
paid
off
student
loans
in
my
first
year
and
a
half
at
Duke
,
through
internships
,
TAing
and
RAing
,
and
I
still
live
on
free
food
events
when
I
can
.
Maybe
other
students
don’t
have
to
worry
about
money
,
but
it’s
not
right
to
blame
them
for
your
lack
of
a
budget
.
Special
to
the
Chronicle
As
a
Fall
teaching
assistant
in
EGR101
the
new
required
engineering
class
for
all
first
years
,
the
biggest
question
students
asked
me
wasn’t
about
the
materials
,
it
was
about
what
to
take
next
semester
.
After
all
,
spring
of
first
year
is
the
first
chance
for
those
interested
in
engineering
to
take
a
specialized
course
,
like
molecular
biology
or
engineering
innovation
.
For
some
,
it’s
a
question
of
which
engineering
track
to
pursue
.
A
seemingly
endless
number
of
introductory
and
fundamental
classes
to
get
through
,
plus
a
constrained
schedule
always
leads
to
concerns
from
the
first
years
.
With
their
limited
knowledge
of
the
various
engineering
disciplines
,
it’s
always
I
don’t
know
much
about
electrical
and
computer
engineering
biomedical
engineering
mechanical
engineering
,
I
don’t
want
to
pick
the
wrong
one
,
or
,
Do
I
even
want
to
be
an
engineer
?
I
always
laugh
a
little
bit
,
try
to
sell
them
on
electrical
and
computer
engineering
,
and
recommend
they
try
out
ECE110
in
the
Spring
semester
.
Then
,
they
ask
about
my
engineering
experience
.
I
am
majoring
in
Biomedical
and
electrical
and
computer
engineering
BME
ECE
.
I’ll
admit
,
I
came
to
Duke
because
of
its
biomedical
engineering
major
,
and
when
I
started
three
and
a
half
years
ago
,
I
was
so
sure
that’s
what
I
wanted
to
do
.
I
had
high
hopes
coming
into
Duke
and
saw
a
few
ways
that
my
future
could
pan
out
1
help
cure
cancer
,
or
2
develop
a
bionic
eye
,
or
3
develop
some
revolutionary
technology
for
low
and
middle
income
countries
,
or
4
3D
print
human
tissues
.
Seven
semesters
later
,
I’m
almost
done
with
my
engineering
majors
,
no
longer
interested
in
doing
any
of
those
things
above
,
and
unsure
if
I
made
the
right
decision
.
This
Fall
,
when
recruiting
season
came
around
,
I
was
hesitant
about
being
an
engineer
altogether
.
Instead
of
talking
to
engineering
firms
at
TechConnect
and
the
career
fair
,
I
started
putting
together
law
school
applications
for
patent
law
,
until
I
changed
my
mind
and
signed
a
full
time
job
offer
that
was
not
engineering
related
at
all
.
Now
,
as
I
grind
through
the
rest
of
my
engineering
classes
,
slowly
inching
towards
the
completion
of
two
engineering
degrees
that
I
won’t
be
using
upon
graduation
,
I
wonder
did
I
make
the
right
decision
three
years
ago
?
Am
I
even
making
the
right
decision
now
?
Upon
looking
at
the
Duke
BME
website’s
official
statistics
for
where
students
go
after
graduation
for
2018
,
it
seems
that
I’m
not
alone
.
Of
the
areas
of
employment
,
healthcare
amp
;
medicine
occupy
the
largest
percentage
27
.
3
percent
followed
by
biotech
,
pharmaceuticals
,
medical
equipment
18
.
2
percent
and
engineering
,
architecture
,
design
with
15
.
9
percent
.
But
added
up
,
it
means
that
only
61
.
4
percent
of
the
BME
majors
stay
in
engineering
or
the
biomedical
field
.
What
happened
to
the
rest
of
them
,
the
38
.
6
percent
?
With
9
.
1
percent
going
into
consulting
,
and
6
.
8
percent
going
into
finance
,
and
13
.
8
percent
going
into
Other
.
Why
didn’t
these
students
stay
in
engineering
?
Engineering
Student
Government
President
and
senior
Tracy
Lu’s
comment
in
a
previous
Chronicle
article
may
help
explain
the
statistics
.
Historically
,
Pratt
has
had
a
heavy
focus
on
consulting
,
finance
,
and
software
in
post
graduation
career
paths
,
Lu
said
,
but
the
curriculum
is
slowly
shifting
towards
training
people
to
be
actual
engineers
.
I
am
glad
that
Duke
is
trying
to
make
engineering
classes
more
practical
.
I
wish
that
my
engineering
education
had
allowed
me
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
changes
being
implemented
,
and
maybe
if
I
had
,
I
would
be
an
actual
engineer
too
.
Had
I
enrolled
at
Duke
for
BME
in
2019
rather
than
2015
,
would
I
be
staying
in
engineering
?
How
would
my
college
experience
have
differed
if
I
had
just
decided
to
pursue
a
completely
different
major
?
Was
it
worth
doing
all
these
years
of
engineering
,
to
ultimately
go
into
something
non
engineering
related
?
I
remember
my
first
nbsp
;
year
,
Dean
Sue
gave
advice
to
students
on
what
to
major
on
.
It
was
something
along
the
lines
of
major
in
what
you’re
interested
in
,
it
doesn’t
really
matter
for
what
you
want
to
do
after
graduation
unless
it’s
in
engineering
.
Well
,
I
majored
in
engineering
,
but
somehow
that’s
not
what
I’m
planning
on
doing
after
graduation
,
and
I
think
I
finally
know
why
.
I
remember
after
taking
ECE110
for
my
BME
major
requirement
,
I
developed
an
interest
in
ECE
.
I
loved
working
with
my
hands
to
build
a
robot
that
could
follow
a
line
and
move
up
a
ramp
,
and
coding
the
logic
behind
it
.
I
picked
up
ECE
as
a
second
major
and
did
an
internship
in
the
ECE
field
.
I’ve
spent
these
years
accumulating
knowledge
about
biology
,
circuits
,
and
semiconductors
,
and
while
I
wouldn’t
say
I
wasted
my
time
,
it’s
pretty
much
all
that
I’ve
done
.
Somewhere
in
the
process
of
keeping
up
with
the
deluge
of
knowledge
that
Pratt
dumps
on
us
,
I
missed
out
on
learning
about
other
things
.
I’ve
come
to
realize
that
there
is
so
much
out
there
beyond
engineering
,
and
wish
I
had
gotten
to
explore
other
areas
.
Engineering
also
lost
its
luster
;
I
kept
taking
classes
that
were
interesting
but
was
frustrated
by
the
lack
of
any
practical
component
.
With
that
in
mind
,
I
decided
that
it
was
finally
time
to
depart
from
engineering
and
find
something
else
where
I
can
continue
to
learn
and
problem
solve
.
I’ve
finally
got
my
chance
to
do
so
,
and
I’m
taking
the
opportunity
to
do
something
else
that
interests
me
.
It
seems
that
Dean
Sue
was
right
in
the
end
,
it
didn’t
matter
what
my
major
was
.
My
name
is
Kim
Cates
and
I
own
Shooters
.
I
have
lived
in
Durham
all
my
life
.
I
am
a
female
entrepreneur
and
,
under
my
ownership
,
Shooters
has
been
a
part
of
the
Durham
community
for
over
20
years
.
As
a
Durham
business
,
Shooters
employs
30
local
individuals
.
Three
of
them
have
been
employed
by
me
since
1996
,
longer
than
some
of
the
students
who
slandered
me
and
my
staff
and
my
club
have
been
alive
.
By
publishing
an
article
with
a
headline
calling
Shooters
Rotten
to
its
core
the
Chronicle
hurt
,
personally
and
professionally
,
each
of
the
local
residents
who
works
at
Shooters
.
Shooters
is
our
second
home
and
we
care
about
every
guest
who
crosses
our
threshold
.
We
know
so
many
of
our
patrons
by
name
,
and
we
know
their
families
,
and
I
want
to
state
publicly
that
I
sincerely
appreciate
all
of
the
current
students
and
alumni
,
and
their
family
members
,
who
have
reached
out
to
support
me
in
this
difficult
time
.
I
care
deeply
about
Durham
,
college
students
,
and
every
patron
of
my
club
.
Students
come
to
my
club
and
tell
me
they
have
a
great
time
.
I
sit
and
talk
with
many
of
them
and
get
to
know
as
many
as
I
can
.
I
applaud
the
Duke
Men’s
Project
for
addressing
the
student
safety
on
and
off
campus
.
The
safety
of
my
patrons
,
especially
the
students
,
is
the
part
of
my
business
I
care
most
about
.
This
is
why
I
employ
four
uniformed
Durham
police
officers
every
single
night
Shooters
is
open
.
These
officers
are
stationed
inside
and
outside
the
club
and
they
monitor
behavior
and
watch
for
conduct
that
may
be
aggressive
or
unwelcome
.
They
are
easy
to
spot
and
ever
present
if
anyone
needs
assistance
.
In
addition
to
a
consistent
police
presence
,
I
have
3
or
4
bouncers
moving
throughout
the
club
at
all
times
.
I
,
personally
,
walk
through
the
club
all
the
time
,
including
monitoring
the
ladies’
restrooms
,
and
our
dance
manager
and
DJ
have
elevated
views
of
the
dance
floor
.
That’s
10
11
adults
responsible
for
watching
the
club
at
all
times
,
in
addition
to
the
adult
bartenders
and
our
adult
van
and
bus
drivers
.
We
can
,
and
do
,
assist
with
problems
or
concerns
of
our
patrons
.
Often
,
we
spot
problems
and
head
them
off
before
anything
bad
develops
.
In
the
event
someone
underage
is
intoxicated
and
our
experience
is
that
underage
patrons
arrive
at
the
club
already
intoxicated
or
semi
intoxicated
,
there
are
many
adults
other
than
the
police
officers
that
they
can
ask
for
help
.
More
about
safety
I
have
38
security
cameras
in
Shooters
and
a
security
room
with
a
staff
member
monitoring
all
camera
feeds
.
Long
ago
I
purchased
4
buses
and
2
vans
to
provide
safe
,
free
transportation
to
and
from
Shooters
so
my
patrons
have
no
reason
to
drink
and
drive
.
I’ve
lowered
barriers
in
the
club
to
increase
visibility
.
If
I
see
someone
who
appears
to
be
intoxicated
,
and
they’re
not
using
our
transportation
,
I
get
them
into
a
cab
or
an
Uber
and
I
try
to
make
sure
someone
goes
home
with
them
for
their
own
safety
.
We
stop
serving
patrons
when
it
is
clear
they
are
intoxicated
.
There
are
times
,
every
week
,
when
we
have
to
escort
patrons
out
of
the
club
for
over
intoxication
.
We
confiscate
fake
IDs
from
kids
all
the
time
.
I
have
been
accused
of
being
mean
and
too
strict
with
my
rules
.
How
is
Shooters
targeted
as
rotten
to
its
core
yet
the
Duke
Men’s
Project
,
the
Duke
activists
,
and
the
Chronicle
have
not
addressed
the
farm
parties
where
students
purchase
alcohol
then
drive
to
a
farm
in
rural
North
Carolina
to
party
which
have
none
of
the
safeguards
I
provide
for
students
when
they
come
to
Shooters
?
What
is
the
Duke
Men’s
Project
doing
to
address
the
safety
of
Duke
students
and
engage
in
drug
facilitated
sexual
assault
DFSA
prevention
at
these
parties
which
are
at
a
private
,
unmonitored
,
off
campus
location
?
Honestly
,
I
was
hurt
and
dismayed
by
the
Chronicle
article
on
November
28
,
2018
,
describing
Shooters
as
complicit
in
rape
culture
.
We
are
not
that
.
We
are
nothing
like
that
.
Shooters
has
been
in
business
for
over
20
years
,
and
no
one
has
ever
been
raped
at
Shooters
nor
has
there
ever
been
a
sexual
assault
prosecution
that
arose
from
Shooters
.
I
respond
immediately
to
any
complaints
I
receive
and
I
review
the
security
tapes
to
provide
evidence
for
any
complaints
I
receive
.
For
the
concerned
students
at
the
town
hall
to
characterize
Shooters
as
founded
on
normalizing
rape
culture
is
just
wrong
.
This
is
like
saying
because
40
.
7
of
the
reports
to
RTI
of
on
campus
sexual
assaults
on
Duke
undergraduate
females
for
the
2015
16
schoolyear
were
alleged
to
have
occurred
in
the
dorms
at
Duke
as
documented
on
page
46
of
the
RTI
study
then
Duke
is
founded
on
normalizing
rape
culture
just
because
it
is
a
co
ed
institution
providing
dorm
rooms
for
male
and
female
students
.
Also
,
Shooters
is
not
the
only
off
campus
establishment
or
party
venue
in
Durham
.
For
the
activists
to
say
they
are
not
optimistic
that
I
will
engage
in
the
training
and
for
Kelsey
Shelofsky
to
state
that
she
is
not
thrilled
about
having
ongoing
dialogue
with
me
is
slanderous
and
insulting
she
has
never
once
reached
out
to
me
to
talk
about
her
concerns
.
In
fact
,
no
one
from
Duke
contacted
me
about
off
campus
sexual
assault
concerns
,
including
the
Chronicle
before
publishing
the
article
,
except
for
the
brief
exchange
with
Larry
Moneta
about
training
,
which
has
been
previously
described
in
the
press
and
is
addressed
below
.
Duke
never
shared
with
me
the
results
of
the
RTI
study
that
examined
on
and
off
campus
sexual
assault
at
Duke
.
I
read
the
information
on
my
own
.
This
is
deeply
disappointing
given
my
annual
conversations
over
18
years
with
Larry
Moneta
and
Sue
Wasiolek
,
my
great
relationships
with
scores
of
Duke
students
,
alumni
,
and
families
,
my
years
long
financial
support
of
the
Chronicle
,
and
my
love
of
Duke
itself
.
I
would
have
responded
to
concerns
that
were
brought
to
me
.
As
a
Durham
native
and
local
business
owner
,
I
really
wish
the
Duke
community
had
given
me
the
chance
to
respond
to
the
horrible
comments
that
defamed
my
professional
reputation
and
hurt
a
Durham
business
,
its
owner
and
its
employees
,
before
holding
a
one
sided
town
hall
and
then
publishing
a
one
sided
article
.
Instead
,
the
town
hall
happened
and
the
article
was
published
without
my
perspective
,
and
now
the
damage
is
done
.
I
am
all
for
bar
staff
drug
facilitated
sexual
assault
training
.
Anything
that
educates
my
staff
and
protects
my
patrons
is
great
and
welcome
.
I
was
contacted
by
Larry
Moneta
regarding
the
training
over
the
summer
.
I
could
have
agreed
to
do
it
in
the
summer
with
my
skeleton
staff
and
then
this
accusation
could
not
have
been
leveled
against
me
.
Yet
I
believed
every
member
of
my
staff
should
participate
in
the
training
,
and
so
I
put
it
off
until
my
full
staff
returned
to
work
.
As
it
turns
out
,
a
simple
review
of
the
Duke
Women’s
Center
website
indicates
the
Center
doesn’t
even
offer
Raise
the
Bar
training
.
As
of
the
date
of
this
letter
and
for
months
prior
,
their
Education
and
Outreach
page
does
not
list
a
bar
training
component
or
offering
.
The

Despite
the
fact
that
Duke
does
not
appear
to
offer
Raise
the
Bar
training
,
my
representative
tried
for
weeks
to
connect
with
Duke
to
arrange
the
training
through
Duke
because
I
had
been
accused
of
refusing
to
work
with
Duke
on
it
.
I
finally
gave
up
and
hired
a
private
consultant
with
expertise
in
rape
crisis
community
education
and
Raise
the
Bar
training
.
My
full
staff
received
focused
and
targeted
DFSA
training
on
Saturday
,
January
5
,
2019
.
I
was
unfairly
criticized
and
targeted
by
Chris
Camp
,
Trey
Walk
,
Kelsey
Shelofsky
,
Alec
Wall
,
and
others
,
in
the
Duke
Men’s
Project
Town
Hall
meeting
as
reported
in
the
Chronicle
.
As
people
who
claim
to
care
about
building
community
,
I
would
have
expected
these
individuals
,
especially
those
concerned
with
respecting
and
empowering
women
,
and
the
Duke
Men’s
Project
,
to
have
reached
out
to
me
a
female
,
native
Durham
entrepreneur
and
initiated
a
positive
and
constructive
dialogue
for
the
benefit
of
Duke
students
and
the
Durham
community
.
Especially
Mr
.
Walk
,
who
knows
that
you
cannot
always
rely
on
traditional
methods
of
town
gown
communications
to
achieve
community
dialogue
and
community
solutions
,
and
Ms
.
Shelofsky
who
appears
to
be
dedicated
to
women’s
empowerment
.
I
would
like
to
think
they
,
like
all
Duke
students
I
know
,
want
to
engage
with
local
institutions
in
constructive
,
not
destructive
,
ways
to
make
a
positive
difference
in
the
community
.
I
would
like
to
know
what
other
Durham
institutions
and
establishments
have
done
,
or
agreed
to
do
,
on
bystander
intervention
,
DFSA
,
or
sexual
harassment
training
.
What
other
Durham
businesses
frequented
by
Duke
students
have
been
contacted
about
such
training
?
I
love
the
students
who
come
to
Shooters
.
I
keep
in
touch
with
them
when
they
on
leaves
,
breaks
and
graduate
.
I
know
and
keep
in
touch
with
their
parents
.
Among
many
charitable
contributions
I’ve
made
,
I
have
supported
Duke
students
with
medical
issues
,
including
going
to
New
York
for
the
funeral
of
one
lovely
young
man
who
died
from
cancer
.
I
am
deeply
disturbed
that
I
a
native
North
Carolinian
,
my
employees
local
residents
,
and
my
business
a
staple
in
the
Durham
and
Duke
communities
for
over
20
years
have
been
unfairly
maligned
and
defamed
,
particularly
when
off
campus
parties
at
remote
farms
,
with
no
security
or
sober
adult
presence
,
go
unchallenged
.
A
few
days
ago
,
a
well
intentioned
university
administrator
sent
an
email
to
students
advising
them
to
self
censor
their
choice
of
language
in
public
in
order
to
maintain
future
opportunities
.
Many
authors
in
this
publication
and
elsewhere
have
pointed
out
the
racially
and
nationally
discriminatory
overtones
this
email
espoused
.
To
my
knowledge
,
none
so
far
have
pointed
out
the
grave
implications
this
incident
has
for
Duke
at
large
.
Over
the
past
several
years
,
the
Foundation
for
Individual
Rights
in
Education
,
the
Heterodox
Academy
,
the
National
Coalition
Against
Censorship
and
others
have
rung
the
alarm
about
what
is
becoming
the
greatest
threat
to
free
speech
on
american
campuses
.
While
dramatic
deplatformings
and
shouting
matches
by
student
protestors
do
happen
and
can
result
in
great
TV
for
Fox
News
,
the
far
more
common
and
concerning
phenomenon
is
students
and
faculty
keeping
their
minority
opinions
to
themselves
due
to
the
hostility
of
their
peers
to
heterodox
views
.
FIRE’s
most
recent
data
indicate
that
over
half
of
college
students
have
self
censored
in
class
at
some
point
since
starting
college
even
among
self
identified
liberals
and
Democrats
.
Claims
that
our
generation
is
being
brainwashed
by
far
left
ideologue
professors
are
mostly
overblown
.
Instead
,
we
are
gradually
training
each
other
to
become
so
socially
risk
averse
that
we
fear
expressing
our
true
thoughts
.
The
fact
that
a
Duke
administrator
saw
nothing
unusual
about
telling
an
entire
national
group
of
students
to
regulate
their
speech
in
a
systematic
way
for
the
sake
of
making
the
English
speaking
majority
more
comfortable
with
their
presence
,
no
less
is
a
damning
sign
that
our
campus
hasn’t
escaped
this
national
trend
.
The
prospect
of
modifying
one’s
speech
for
the
comfort
of
the
faceless
majority
should
be
viewed
as
dystopian
,
not
mundane
.
Moving
forward
,
I
hope
that
this
campus
will
think
about
how
we
so
readily
and
powerfully
judge
one
another
based
on
just
a
few
words
whether
it’s
by
the
language
they
are
spoken
in
or
the
ideas
they
represent
.
Institutional
racism
at
Duke
has
once
again
made
national
headlines
this
weekend
,
courtesy
of
a
strongly
worded
email
sent
by
an
administrator
to
her
graduate
students
.
In
a
mass
email
sent
to
all
first
year
and
second
year
students
enrolled
in
the
Master
of
Biostatistics
program
,
the
director
of
graduate
studies
,
Megan
Neely
,
warned
her
students
against
conversing
in
Mandarin
while
on
campus
.
In
an
earlier
email
from
Neely
,
she
expressed
similar
sentiments
,
castigating
Chinese
international
students
for
speaking
in
Mandarin
while
carrying
on
private
conversations
.
It
seems
that
for
Neely
and
certain
members
of
the
biostatistics
department
,
the
sound
of
Mandarin
being
spoken
at
an
international
research
university
was
too
much
for
their
monolingual
white
ears
to
handle
.
The
consequences
they
laid
out
for
students
who
dared
to
violate
their
linguistic
mandate
were
,
unsurprisingly
,
draconian
refrain
from
speaking
Mandarin
in
front
of
professors
,
or
risk
losing
work
and
research
opportunities
.
The
backlash
was
almost
immediate
.
Within
minutes
,
screenshots
of
the
most
recent
email
appeared
on
the
popular
Facebook
page
,
Duke
Memes
for
Gothicc
Teens
,
and
went
up
on
the
more
general
All
Duke
page
as
well
.
As
this
story
has
developed
over
the
weekend
,
its
audience
has
grown
to
be
an
international
topic
of
discussion
.
On
Subtle
Asian
Traits
the
Facebook
group
dedicated
to
the
various
aspects
of
the
Asian
Asian
American
experience
the
post
detailing
the
incident
garnered
over
9
,
000
likes
and
2
,
000
comments
.
Neely
has
since
stepped
down
from
her
role
as
the
Director
of
Graduate
Studies
,
but
as
of
the
time
of
publication
,
remains
an
assistant
professor
at
the
university
.
The
two
faculty
members
who
,
according
to
her
email
,
sought
her
out
to
single
out
specific
students
remain
unnamed
.
The
Office
of
Institutional
Equity
has
been
asked
to
investigate
the
issue
,
but
the
implications
of
the
incident
merit
further
discussion
.
Not
only
were
the
two
emails
blatantly
xenophobic
,
but
the
fact
that
the
chair
of
the
department
,
the
director
of
graduate
studies
and
at
least
two
faculty
members
actively
agreed
on
such
sentiments
indicates
that
this
is
a
deeply
systemic
issue
one
that
leads
to
concrete
racial
discrimination
in
the
form
of
denied
jobs
,
research
positions
and
internships
.
The
question
arises
why
the
Chinese
students
,
specifically
?
If
they
were
French
or
German
and
speaking
in
their
native
languages
,
would
the
two
faculty
members
have
approached
Neely
and
requested
their
names
and
faces
?
We
see
this
contradiction
play
out
all
around
us
.
Certain
languages
deemed
too
far
outside
the
white
mainstream
like
Spanish
,
Chinese
,
and
Arabic
incur
more
scrutiny
and
suspicion
than
others
,
and
their
speakers
face
more
persecution
.
This
form
of
racism
affects
more
than
just
international
Chinese
students
multiple
ethnic
groups
share
solidarity
in
the
fight
for
linguistic
and
,
by
extension
,
cultural
autonomy
.
Of
course
,
Duke
outwardly
values
diversity
in
language
,
culture
,
and
experiences
.
We
brand
ourselves
as
an
international
research
university
,
and
with
our
new
campus
at
Kunshan
,
this
marketing
has
only
gotten
stronger
.
When
the
new
class
of
Kunshan
students
arrives
in
Durham
to
study
at
Duke's
U
.
S
.
campus
,
they
will
quickly
realize
that
all
the
talk
of
inclusivity
hides
the
true
mission
of
both
campuses
cultural
imperialism
.
Duke
has
a
long
history
with
this
;
in
the
mid
1880s
,
Duke
accepted
20
Cherokee
boys
all
below
college
age
into
the
university
with
the
express
mission
of
're
education'
and
assimilation
into
American
culture
.
To
be
an
international
student
at
Duke
,
assimilation
continues
to
be
a
prerequisite
for
success
learn
English
,
learn
to
drive
,
accustom
oneself
to
fatty
Western
foods
,
learn
Western
social
norms
and
etiquette
.
Ultimately
,
assimilation
results
in
the
absorption
and
performance
of
whiteness
,
a
combination
of
which
is
required
in
most
professional
and
academic
circles
worldwide
.
Neely
claims
that
speaking
Mandarin
within
earshot
of
potential
employers
will
hurt
students'
professional
chances
,
and
she's
right
,
she
is
speaking
to
this
nationwide
process
of
quashing
languages
and
other
aspects
of
culture
outside
of
the
white
norm
.
For
students
of
color

I
miss
the
days
before
Monday
nights
were
reserved
for
wine
and
virgin
shaming
.
Colton
Underwood
,
the
new
Bachelor
,
is
a
26
year
old
virgin
and
it’s
all
anyone
is
talking
about
.
In
fact
,
this
entire
season
of
the
Bachelor
revolves
around
Colton’s
virginity
.
And
it’s
really
screwed
up
.
I’m
not
the
only
one
disturbed
by
this
.
Thousands
of
viewers
have
raged
on
Twitter
about
the
show’s
focus
on
Colton’s
lack
of
sexual
experience
.
There
are
two
main
complaints
that
virgin
shaming
is
trite
,
and
that
Colton’s
virginity
is
irrelevant
.
Though
pathetic
,
the
well
of
virgin
shaming
jokes
seems
to
be
bottomless
.
Why
,
though
,
do
we
find
these
comments
funny
in
the
first
place
?
To
answer
that
question
,
we
must
turn
to
the
root
of
the
other
complaint
why
are
we
so
interested
in
virginity
?
The
argument
for
the
irrelevance
of
virginity
is
a
tricky
one
.
Of
course
,
definitional
virgins
people
who
have
not
had
sex
must
exist
.
I’ll
address
how
the
ambiguous
definitions
of
sex
and
virginity
exclude
the
queer
and
trans
communities
another
time
,
because
that’s
another
issue
entirely
.
But
as
a
social
concept
,
virginity
had
to
be
created
.
The
concept
of
virginity
was
constructed
to
serve
the
institution
of
marriage
.
According
to
the
rules
of
this
institution
,
the
only
women
fit
to
be
married
were
virgins
.
Pure
.
Untouched
.
Any
unmarried
woman
who
was
not
a
virgin
was
tainted
,
making
her
a
worthless
possession
.
Thousands
and
even
hundreds
of
years
ago
,
the
purpose
of
marriage
was
primarily
social
,
another
way
for
men
to
raise
their
status
by
acquiring
a
new
asset
a
virginal
wife
.
Because
a
man’s
virginity
was
socially
meaningless
,
he
was
free
to
engage
in
whatever
sexual
pursuits
he
might
desire
,
regardless
of
his
marital
status
.
This
solidified
a
crucial
distinction
sex
as
masculine
,
virginity
as
feminine
.
Fast
forward
to
today
.
Virginity
is
no
longer
a
necessity
.
There
are
,
for
most
people
,
no
institutional
consequences
to
having
sex
or
to
not
having
it
.
It
shouldn’t
matter
.
But
it
does
,
for
two
main
reasons
.
The
first
is
more
obvious
we’re
obsessed
with
sex
.
Of
course
,
not
all
of
us
actually
experience
sexual
desire
.
But
because
most
do
,
it’s
hard
to
evade
its
consideration
.
To
some
degree
,
this
is
in
our
nature
.
Whether
or
not
we
consciously
want
to
have
kids
,
now
or
ever
,
our
bodies
and
our
minds
are
evolutionarily
primed
to
desire
sex
.
As
college
kids
,
we
know
this
all
too
well
.
Our
hormones
are
running
on
high
,
and
we’re
finally
allowed
to
act
on
them
.
The
fact
that
sex
is
a
taboo
topic
makes
its
discussion
even
more
enticing
.
Regardless
of
whether
you’re
doing
it
,
you
want
to
know
who
is
,
and
with
whom
,
and
all
the
juicy
details
in
between
.
You
want
those
details
both
because
their
private
nature
makes
them
even
more
compelling
,
and
because
your
neurons
start
firing
at
any
mention
of
the
one
action
completely
integral
to
humanity’s
survival
.
But
there’s
another
reason
we
still
exploit
the
concept
of
virginity
.
It
no
longer
serves
the
institution
of
marriage
,
but
it
does
serve
another
social
system
sexism
.
Even
though
it’s
often
impractical
,
virginity
remains
the
ideal
for
women
because
it
is
deeply
ingrained
as
a
feminine
trait
.
Of
course
,
this
makes
no
sense
how
do
men
expect
to
have
heterosexual
sex
the
only
manly
form
of
sex
if
women
are
expected
not
to
have
it
?

Luckily
for
men
,
women
are
finally
beginning
to
fulfill
their
desires
,
but
at
a
cost
the
creation
of
a
double
standard
.
Women
are
both
expected
to
have
sex
and
not
to
have
it
.
Female
virgins
are
simultaneously
pure
and
prudish
,
while
female
non
virgins
are
both
sexy
and
slutty
.
There
is
no
winning
,
and
that’s
the
point
.
At
every
turn
,
the
social
ideals
of
sex
and
virginity
are
designed
to
degrade
women
while
supporting
men
.
That
dynamic
is
intentional
.
But
men
aren’t
immune
entirely
from
the
consequences
of
this
sexism
.
Because
virgins
are
presumed
female
,
male
virgins
are
shamed
.
Not
merely
because
having
sex
would
make
them
explicitly
more
masculine
.
But
because
their
lack
of
sexual
experience
makes
them
explicitly
more
feminine
.
And
to
be
feminine
rather
,
to
be
a
woman
is
shameful
.
The
core
of
virgin
shaming
jokes
isn’t
sex
at
all
it’s
sexism
.
nbsp
;
We
justify
these
quips
by
assuming
that
sex
jokes
,
in
general
,
are
funny
.
But
in
reality
,
we’re
ridiculing
what
we
see
as
an
inferior
trait
femininity
.
Virgin
shaming
irrelevant
.
But
to
address
these
problems
,
we
can’t
merely
say
that
being
a
virgin
doesn’t
make
you
any
less
of
a
man
.
We
must
seek
to
remove
the
concept
of
virginity
from
gender
entirely
.
Otherwise
,
it
is
only
when
women
are
not
seen
as
weak
that
virginity
will
not
be
seen
as
weakness
.
About
75
students
organized
by
the
Afro
American
Society
were
met
with
tear
gas
after
occupying
the
Allen
Building
for
10
hours
on
Feb
.
13
,
1969
.
On
February
13th
,
1969
,
tear
gas
hung
thick
in
the
air
outside
of
the
Allen
Building
.
More
than
one
hundred
local
police
officers
and
National
Guard
troops
had
been
called
in
to
bring
order
to
the
protest
;
dozens
of
white
students
stood
nearby
to
support
their
classmates
.
Approximately
75
of
Duke’s
first
Black
students
were
inside
the
building
in
a
struggle
they
hoped
would
change
the
University
forever
.
As
early
as
Spring
1968
,
in
the
wake
of
Dr
.
Martin
Luther
King
Jr
.
’s
assassination
,
these
students
had
attempted
to
work
with
Duke’s
administration
to
address
conditions
for
Black
students
on
campus
,
issuing
13
demands
.
These
demands
included
increased
Black
enrollment
,
the
funding
of
the
Black
Student
Union
,
and
better
conditions
for
workers
on
campus
.
Key
among
these
demands
was
the
creation
of
an
Afro
American
Studies
Department
a
recognition
that
lives
and
histories
of
African
Americans
mattered
,
and
were
worthy
of
attention
and
scholarship
.
During
the
standoff
many
of
the
students
threatened
to
leave
Duke
to
attend
the
local
Malcolm
X
Liberation
University
,
a
Durham
based
program
run
by
activist
Howard
Fuller
that
would
center
the
curriculum
on
the
African
diaspora
.
Ultimately
,
to
demonstrate
their
resolve
and
catalyze
such
desperately
needed
change
,
the
students
held
the
first
major
takeover
of
a
Southern
university
.
Though
the
protest
would
end
in
arrests
,
disciplinary
action
,
and
police
turning
chemical
weapons
on
peaceful
students
,
it
would
later
be
hailed
by
former
Duke
President
Nannerl
Keohane
as
seminal
to
the
University’s
moral
development
.
In
a
letter
commemorating
30
years
of
African
American
students
at
Duke
she
wrote
,
These
events
were
a
stimulus
for
many
of
the
university’s
most
difficult
,
yet
necessary
,
changes
.
Dr
.
Brenda
Armstrong
,
a
physician
who
committed
her
life
to
improving
the
University
,
was
one
of
the
students
involved
in
the
Takeover
.
She
recalled
the
Takeover
as
a
stand
that
would
change
the
course
of
Duke’s
destiny
and
indelibly
mark
our
place
for
all
time
in
this
institution’s
history
.
The
impact
of
these
students’
actions
was
rapid
the
Takeover
spurred
the
creation
of
a
Black
Studies
department
later
that
year
.
Their
legacy
,
however
,
would
endure
as
part
of
the
growing
national
student
movement
demanding
ethnic
studies
departments
that
provided
a
critical
and
interdisciplinary
study
of
race
,
ethnicity
,
and
indigeneity
from
the
perspectives
of
communities
of
color
in
the
United
States
and
abroad
.
These
activists
confronted
higher
education
with
key
questions
whose
knowledge
is
valuable
?
What
questions
are
worth
studying
?
Whose
communities
should
we
learn
about
in
the
classroom
?
And
who
controls
the
education
students
receive
?
In
the
1960s
,
as
college
students
engaged
in
both
the
Civil
Rights
Movement
and
an
emergent
Black
Power
movement
that
sought
to
expand
and
challenge
American
democracy
through
desegregation
,
voting
rights
and
economic
opportunity
they
attempted
to
rewrite
the
answers
to
these
fundamental
assumptions
of
the
academy
.
From
May
1967
to
March
1969
,
Black
students
at
San
Francisco
State
University
and
the
University
of
California
,
Berkeley
engaged
in
repeated
protests
and
strikes
for
a
Black
Studies
department
often
in
the
face
of
violent
resistance
,
not
only
from
University
administration
but
from
the
state’s
deployment
of
local
law
enforcement
and
the
National
Guard
.
At
SFSU
,
a
coalition
of
Latinx
,
Filipino
,
and
Black
students
formed
the
Third
World
Liberation
Front
to
act
in
concert
on
their
demands
for
ethnics
studies
programs
,
and
a
similar
group
formed
at
UC
Berkeley
soon
after
.
They
understood
that
solidarity
across
race
was
essential
to
their
political
project
.
Demanding
universities
take
seriously
the
experiences
of
communities
of
color
was
an
unprecedented
shift
one
that
required
tremendous
energy
from
student
activists
and
generated
intense
backlash
from
those
in
power
.
Students
at
Duke
,
SFSU
,
and
Berkeley
advocated
for
these
departments
both
to
make
universities
more
representative
and
as
an
ideological
challenge
to
white
supremacy
.
Their
efforts
were
also
based
on
the
belief
that
these
disciplines
are
not
niche
courses
for
leisure
or
personal
indulgence
of
racial
and
ethnic
minorities
;
these
fields
,
decidedly
non
Eurocentric
,
widen
our
collective
knowledge
.
They
offer
universal
insights
and
truths
.
Mirroring
the
ideological
challenge
presented
by
the
push
for
ethnic
studies
,
women
and
LGBTQIA
activists
simultaneously
advocated
for
the
study
of
feminism
,
gender
,
and
sexuality
.
From
the
creation
of
Black
Studies
at
Duke
in
1969
,
to
the
establishment
of
Latino
a
Studies
in
the
Global
South
in
the
1990s
,
to
the
announcement
of
an
Asian
American
Studies
Program
just
last
year
and
many
more
,
these
struggles
were
clearly
linked
and
,
as
alluded
to
by
President
Keohane
,
they
transformed
Duke
.
Moreover
,
the
students
of
the
60s
saw
their
experiences
as
linked
to
the
social
and
political
upheaval
happening
in
the
world
outside
the
ivory
towers
.
People
of
color
,
environmentalists
,
young
people
,
anti
war
protesters
,
and
others
marched
in
the
street
and
organized
in
their
local
communities
,
envisioning
an
America
absent
imperialism
,
white
supremacy
,
and
environmental
degradation
that
disproportionately
affected
people
of
color
.
If
their
moment
demanded
the
creation
of
ethnic
studies
,
our
moment
demands
a
defense
of
them
.
We
live
on
a
campus
where
on
a
normal
walk
to
dinner
one
might
stumble
upon
white
supremacist
propaganda
stickers
;
we
live
in
a
country
where
places
of
worship
become
sites
of
racist
and
anti
Semitic
violence
.
Less
palpable
but
equally
pernicious
is
the
reality
that
the
very
civil
rights
these
students
fought
for
are
under
threat
today
.
We
should
not
take
these
rights
nor
these
classes
for
granted
.
It
is
still
Add
Drop
period
,
and
a
brief
scroll
through
DukeHub
shows
that
there
are
still
course
openings
in
African
and
African
American
Studies
,
Asian
and
Middle
Eastern
Studies
,
Jewish
Studies
,
Latin
American
Studies
,
Latino
Studies
and
the
Global
South
,
Slavic
and
Eurasian
Studies
,
and
International
Comparative
Studies
.
Among
the
course
offerings
,
perhaps
consider
AAAS
102
Intro
to
African
American
Studies
,
AMES
225
Islam
in
the
Age
of
Trump
,
or
ICS
106
Intro
to
Latino
a
Studies
.
I
Trey
waited
too
long
to
take
courses
exploring
my
identity
as
an
African
American
and
those
of
other
communities
.
As
for
me
Gino
,
my
passion
for
American
history
and
social
movements
is
incomplete
without
deepened
study
of
marginalized
communities
.
Moreover
,
these
courses
are
our
inheritance
from
the
brave
students
who
pushed
Duke
and
other
universities
to
create
these
departments
.
This
column
is
the
first
in
a
public
conversation
between
two
friends
trying
to
make
sense
of
Duke
and
beyond
.
Throughout
the
semester
,
we
will
attempt
to
give
historical
context
to
our
contemporary
moment
in
hopes
that
this
will
help
us
think
about
things
more
clearly
.
Believing
,
as
we
do
,
that
the
world
we
have
today
is
the
product
of
history
and
people
who
came
before
,
gives
urgency
to
our
task
of
deciding
what
kind
of
world
we
will
make
.
To
that
end
,
start
with
us
today
take
an
ethnic
studies
course
at
Duke
.
When
I
first
read
my
fellow
columnist
and
co
worker
,
Lizzie
Bond’s
,
latest
column
,
my
gut
reaction
was
to
issue
a
quick
fortification
of
my
previous
case
for
Selective
Living
Groups
A
greater
defense
for
SLGs
if
you
will
.
After
reading
her
column
,
and
trying
to
see
Duke
social
life
through
her
lens
,
however
,
I
can
truly
only
say
two
words
thank
you
.
While
we
may
disagree
on
a
few
key
issues
,
Lizzie’s
response
to
the
article
I
wrote
was
simply
brilliant
if
for
no
other
reason
than
that
it
publically
propelled
an
important
campus
conversation
.
Since
coming
to
Duke
,
I
have
seen
few
instances
where
the
content
in
the
Chronicle
result
in
a
public
discussion
on
what
is
best
for
Duke
students
as
members
of
this
community
.
But
,
since
the
day
my
previous
column
was
published
,
I
have
seen
story
after
story
about
the
ways
people
interact
with
and
experience
selective
living
on
campus
.
From
one
columnist’s
rush
FAQ
,
to
another’s
hindsight
on
not
receiving
a
bid
his
freshman
year
,
even
to
the
more
public
display
of
anti
rush
banners
in
West
Union
,
the
fact
that
Duke’s
campus
is
engaging
in
a
lively
conversation
about
what
this
time
of
year
means
for
students
and
their
place
on
their
campus
encourages
me
to
no
end
.
What
I
have
seen
since
rush
season
began
is
an
undying
conversation
about
the
best
way
for
students
to
integrate
into
a
larger
campus
community
while
finding
places
where
they
can
feel
more
at
home
.
It
is
precisely
this
undying
conversation
that
excites
me
most
about
the
work
my
fellow
columnists
are
producing
and
encourages
me
to
seek
out
the
tough
campus
conversations
that
I
came
to
Duke
to
have
.
Whether
that
is
in
the
pages
of
the
Duke
Chronicle
or
on
the
couches
in
Au
Bon
Pain
,
these
past
two
weeks
have
been
some
of
the
most
intellectually
engaging
I
have
had
at
Duke
.
This
is
all
thanks
to
different
viewpoints
and
perspectives
about
rush
being
continuously
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
greater
Duke
community
.

like
these
are
why
student
publications
,
public
discourse
,
and
the
freedom
of
speech
are
so
important
.
Exposing
ourselves
to
opposing
viewpoints
allows
for
the
greater
engagement
in
a
never
ending
public
forum
aimed
at
making
Duke
better
for
us
all
.
Granted
,
that
doesn’t
mean
every
word
printed
in
the
Chronicle
or
spewed
from
a
public
platform
is
impervious
to
criticism
.
The
second
I
wrote
The
case
for
SLGs
,
I
prepared
myself
for
any
critique
that
could
and
would
ultimately
come
my
way
.
Moreover
,
as
Nathan
Heffernan
pointed
out
in
his
recent
column
,
the
freedom
of
expression
that
comes
with
writing
your
own
column
does
not
mean
that
writers
and
readers
should
stop
listening
to
,
learning
about
,
,
and
considering
experiences
different
from
our
own
especially
those
coming
from
marginalized
communities
.
I
have
been
glued
to
the
words
in
the
Chronicle
since
I
have
come
to
Duke
.
For
better
,
what’s
printed
and
published
in
this
student
newspaper
forces
the
campus
community
to
reconcile
with
its
deepest
sources
of
division
.
Appealing
to
students
to
send
their
money
just
about
anywhere
other
than
Duke
put
pressure
on
upper
administration
to
spend
their
money
more
intentionally
.
A
former
line
monitors
plea
to
kill
the
walk
up
line
after
a
mob
like
scene
led
to
its
ultimate
demise
.
The
discourse
over
one
student’s
defense
of
recently
appointed
Supreme
Court
Justice
Brett
Kavanaugh
led
to
a
public
debate
about
the
confirmation
hearing
,
masculinity
,
and
the
future
of
politics
.
These
and
countless
other
examples
showcase
the
power
of
the
publication
of
different
viewpoints
.
With
all
that
being
said
,
if
I
am
able
to
write
something
that
leads
to
or
contributes
to
the
campus
conversations
that
we
need
to
be
having
,
I
am
more
than
willing
to
stick
my
neck
out
for
the
sake
of
public
debate
.
The
jest
Lizzie
and
I
engaged
in
over
the
course
of
two
articles
shows
me
that
students
on
this
campus
have
the
backbone
to
stand
up
for
what
they
think
is
right
.
It
shows
me
that
I
am
surrounded
by
students
who
are
willing
to
publicly
proclaim
their
trust
and
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
.
That’s
why
journalism
and
public
discourse
is
so
important
.
So
,
Lizzie
Bond
,
thank
you
for
showing
me
the
importance
of
speaking
your
truth
even
if
it
means
speaking
out
against
what’s
normative
.
In
November
,
Honor
Council
wrote
about
how
to
behave
honorably
in
a
global
world
.
When
I
read
it
,
I
reflected
on
my
own
moral
code
and
recognized
the
ways
in
which
it
was
similar
to
that
of
others
.
Yet
I
also
realized
that
my
unique
background
and
personal
experiences
have
shaped
my
perspectives
on
life
.
I
come
from
Accra
,
Ghana
.
Growing
up
,
I
yearned
for
a
life
depicted
in
movies
from
the
West
,
stories
from
my
town’s
intellectuals
,
and
glossy
magazines
featuring
beautiful
mansions
and
modern
cars
.
I
pictured
myself
visiting
foreign
countries
,
making
new
friends
,
and
experiencing
foreign
cultures
.
This
,
however
,
was
a
pleasant
dream
like
fantasy
that
my
family’s
financial
status
wouldn’t
allow
.
At
an
early
age
,
nbsp
;
hard
work
and
personal
values
mattered
the
most
.
I
cherished
resilience
,
honor
,
focus
,
respect
and
excellence
.
I
worked
hard
and
graduated
high
school
at
the
top
of
my
class
.
However
,
I
hadn’t
figured
out
what
I
wanted
out
of
life
beyond
academics
.
I
searched
for
suitable
career
options
on
the
internet
and
phoned
a
few
friends
in
the
neighborhood
to
ask
about
college
majors
.
Through
conversing
with
family
members
and
friends
,
I
realized
that
I
had
missed
out
on
too
many
opportunities
and
left
out
some
of
the
most
important
people
from
my
life
.
In
prioritizing
grades
,
I
pushed
my
passions
aside
and
neglected
personal
relationships
with
my
teachers
and
peers
.
nbsp
;
Upon
realizing
this
shortcoming
and
with
a
desire
to
improve
my
interpersonal
skills
,
I
decided
to
take
a
gap
year
.
The
gap
year
afforded
me
the
opportunity
to
reflect
on
what
was
most
important
to
me
personal
growth
,
success
,
education
.
I
chronicled
all
the
struggles
I
had
faced
from
stressing
over
school
performance
to
dealing
with
family
pressure
and
depression
.
nbsp
;
Moreover
,
I
took
the
time
to
prepare
and
apply
to
college
.
During
these
challenging
and
stressful
times
,
I
stuck
to
my
personal
value
of
acting
honorably
in
all
my
endeavors
and
instead
focused
on
pinning
down
the
triumphs
and
successes
.
On
December
15th
,
I
trembled
,
glued
to
my
computer
to
check
my
fate
.
Dear
Franklin
,
Congratulations
,
you
have
been
admitted
to
Duke
University
.
.
Though
I
was
excited
my
actions
paid
off
with
an
acceptance
to
Duke
,
my
dad
passed
away
two
months
later
.
Weeks
of
weeping
.
nbsp
;
Days
of
loneliness
.
Moments
of
sadness
.
Grief
.
My
dad
was
everything
to
me
.
His
priceless
advice
and
mentorship
.
His
love
,
care
and
concern
.
His
teachings
and
constant
encouragement
took
me
through
all
the
tough
times
at
school
.
I
think
of
him
every
single
day
.
May
his
soul
rest
in
peace
.
Coming
to
Duke
helped
ease
the
pain
.
I
found
a
whole
new
family
.
Everyone
was
welcoming
and
readily
available
to
help
.
It
was
a
new
beginning
,
a
time
to
soldier
on
from
the
loss
and
struggle
.
I
took
up
leadership
roles
and
actively
got
involved
in
clubs
and
activities
.
Owing
to
the
lessons
I
learned
during
the
gap
year
,
I
tried
out
new
classes
,
passions
and
activities
.
I
joined
the
Duke
Honor
Council
,
whose
embodiment
of
honor
and
integrity
resonated
with
me
.
Honor
Council
challenged
my
thinking
and
shaped
my
views
on
sensitive
topics
such
as
race
relations
,
gender
,
and
religion
.
Several
discussions
centered
on
the
Duke
Community
Standard
taught
me
how
to
better
cope
with
different
perspectives
;
these
lessons
enhanced
my
understanding
of
my
values
,
abilities
,
and
interests
.
I
found
a
community
in
Honor
Council
.
Despite
the
welcoming
environment
,
the
authentic
relationships
,
adventure
,
and
support
,
I
nbsp
;
still
struggled
.
Everything
was
familiar
,
yet
so
strange
and
sophisticated
language
,
diversity
,
curriculum
.
My
accent
impeded
communication
.
Students
struggled
to
decipher
my
messages
.
I
struggled
to
encode
meaning
in
speeches
.
I
smiled
through
others’
jokes
without
really
understanding
a
thing
,
careful
not
to
offer
disjointed
reactions
.
I
had
wowed
folks
back
home
through
my
perceived
prowess
in
the
Queen’s
language
;
yet
I
now
questioned
my
speaking
abilities
.
Fellow
international
students
weaved
through
conversations
spanning
controversial
and
sensitive
topics
.
Along
with
accent
and
communication
issues
,
I
encountered
a
cultural
shock
through
classroom
structure
and
curriculum
.
While
my
previous
educational
models
considered
teachers
as
the
sole
holders
of
knowledge
,
Duke’s
model
views
teachers
and
students
as
co
investigators
of
materials
covered
in
the
classrooms
.
I
struggled
to
adjust
to
this
mindset
.
Many
times
,
I
walked
into
the
restrooms
,
looked
in
the
mirror
and
blamed
myself
for
not
being
a
good
student
.
’
Everyone
else
seemed
to
exhibit
excellence
and
perfection
with
little
effort
nbsp
;
a
persona
template
most
Duke
students
try
to
align
and
fit
into
.
Personally
,
I
was
forced
to
take
up
a
fake
identity
to
fit
the
template
.
Yet
,
somehow
,
it
didn’t
feel
right
nbsp
;
I
felt
I
was
insincere
,
nbsp
;
acting
dishonorably
in
my
endeavors
.
It
took
a
while
before
I
mustered
enough
courage
to
confide
in
my
lecturers
and
classmates
.
Great
pieces
of
advice
came
my
way
.
Engineering
101
professor
Dr
.
Ann
Saterbak
offered
the
advice
with
most
impact
try
out
new
learning
techniques
,
immerse
yourself
in
new
experiences
.
You
will
be
fine
,
you’re
smart
.
These
words
helped
me
navigate
my
first
semester
and
life
in
a
foreign
land
.
The
advice
taught
me
that
part
of
living
honorably
is
giving
myself
grace
for
inevitable
failures
and
bumps
along
the
way
.
Inspired
by
conversations
with
friends
who
opened
up
about
their
academic
struggles
,
I
started
embracing
my
own
deficiencies
.
nbsp
;
I’ve
learned
that
it’s
okay
to
be
vulnerable
,
to
struggle
and
even
to
fail
.
By
engaging
in
open
dialogue
and
sharing
our
experiences
in
their
rawest
,
truest
form
,
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
honest
,
open
and
complete
.
As
we
all
begin
this
spring
semester
,
three
valuable
pieces
of
advice
I
would
like
to
share
on
behalf
of
Honor
Council
nbsp
;
first
,
be
as
open
minded
as
possible
to
every
opportunity
;
try
out
new
stuff
.
nbsp
;
Second
,
embrace
new
challenges
,
and
don’t
let
obstacles
hinder
your
path
towards
success
.
Third
,
be
honest
with
who
you
are
and
be
proud
of
your
strengths
but
also
your
weaknesses
.
Finals
week
for
most
Duke
students
is
a
time
defined
by
long
nights
of
studying
,
stress
and
tests
.
Or
so
I
hear
.
Somehow
,
I
ended
up
with
no
finals
last
semester
and
instead
used
that
time
to
travel
to
New
York
with
my
boyfriend
.
The
concrete
jungle
where
dreams
are
made
of
,
New
York
was
our
idyllic
paradise
;
an
Eden
of
sorts
400
miles
away
from
Edens
Quad
for
a
figurative
Adam
and
Steve
who
can’t
populate
the
world
on
account
of
being
gay
men
.
But
like
the
biblical
garden
of
Abrahamic
lore
,
my
Eden
too
was
liminal
,
accessible
now
only
in
memories
of
my
once
innocent
state
of
mind
.
And
like
the
outcome
for
the
inhabitants
of
that
allegorious
space
,
my
bliss
was
ended
by
a
snake
.
On
December
17
,
2018
,
my
roommate
Gabriel
Goldhagen
texted
me
Jordan
!
There
was
a
teeny
tiny
dead
snake
in
the
room
.
I’m
not
even
kidding
.
There
has
been
a
snake
in
our
room
all
semester
.
Lol
.
My
brave
roommate
who
picked
it
up
and
disposed
of
it
described
the
reptile
as
curled
up
in
a
ball
,
decaying
.
He
said
it
wasn’t
too
big
,
and
then
we
made
penis
jokes
about
that
comment
How
big
is
your
snake
?
.
Within
my
head
,
however
,
this
development
was
no
laughing
matter
.
Over
winter
break
,
I
had
nightmares
of
a
giant
basilisk
emerging
from
under
my
twin
bed
at
school
and
killing
me
with
a
single
stare
.
On
other
nights
it
was
a
boa
constrictor
slithering
across
my
body
and
slowly
squeezing
the
life
out
of
me
,
hissing
with
cruel
pleasure
.
Any
time
I
remembered
my
dorm
,
I
felt
an
imagined
snake
gliding
over
my
legs
until
I
reminded
myself
that
it
wasn’t
real
.
As
someone
whose
primary
exposure
to
snakes
growing
up
was
from
Harry
Potter
and
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
,
I
learned
early
on
that
snakes
were
horrifying
monsters
and
spoiler
alert
also
the
last
horcrux
that
Harry
and
his
crew
have
to
destroy
.
Harrison
Ford
,
screaming
in
panic
about
a
snake
in
his
plane
in
Indiana
Jones
,
socialized
me
to
fear
reptiles
early
on
.
Come
to
think
about
it
,
Nicki
Minaj’s
Anaconda
may
be
the
only
positive
media
portrayal
of
snakes
I
was
ever
exposed
to
,
and
even
then
,
the
song
is
spoiler
alert
mostly
about
butts
.
Needless
to
say
,
then
,
my
immediate
reaction
was
terror
,
and
an
entirely
rational
refusal
to
return
to
Duke
or
the
state
of
North
Carolina
at
all
.
Given
my
lack
of
familiarity
on
the
subject
,
I
decided
to
research
snakes
.
Did
you
know
that
snakes
can
swallow
large
prey
through
their
mobile
jaws
?
I
didn’t
,
and
reading
that
fact
only
made
me
more
convinced
that
this
snake
entered
my
room
to
eat
me
in
my
sleep
.
But
my
Eve
like
curiosity
prevailed
,
and
I
couldn’t
stop
myself
from
biting
the
metaphorical
apple
that
the
internet’s
snake
facts
presented
me
.
I
continued
reading
.
Soon
,
I
learned
that
there
are
five
types
of
venomous
snakes
common
in
North
Carolina
,
including
the
Copperhead
,
Cottonmouth
Water
Moccasin
,
Eastern
Diamondback
Rattlesnake
,
Pigmy
Rattlesnake
,
and
Timber
Rattlesnake
,
any
of
which
could
have
been
the
poisonous
monster
that
found
shelter
in
my
dorm
room
rent
free
.
In
studying
the
biblical
history
of
serpents
,
I
found
out
the
hard
way
that
the
first
search
result
for
Adam
and
Eve
is
not
a
Wikipedia
page
but
a
link
to
a
sex
toy
shop
.
Go
figure
!
After
some
light
perusing
,
I
delved
back
into
my
research
and
soon
picked
up
enough
proficiency
in
Genesis
vocabulary
to
write
the
intro
to
this
piece
.
They
say
that
ignorance
is
bliss
.
Part
of
me
wishes
I
had
never
been
told
about
my
third
,
reptilian
roommate
from
last
semester
and
I
could
comfortably
walk
to
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
snake
was
found
.
But
what
I’ve
realized
is
that
life
outside
Eden
isn’t
so
bad
after
all
.
In
the
choice
between
ignorance
and
knowledge
,
I’m
glad
to
be
aware
of
the
truth
.
Like
Eve
,
aware
of
her
nudity
,
I
clothe
myself
in
consciousness
and
not
just
because
it's
freezing
outside
and
I
have
great
taste
in
Winter
wardrobe
.
I’ve
found
a
new
paradise
,
basking
in
the
divinity
of
my
own
curiosity
.
Am
I
any
less
scared
of
snakes
now
?
No
,
but
have
I
read
the
Wikipedia
page
for
snakes
?
Yes
.
And
I’m
going
to
celebrate
that
personal
growth
,
just
like
we
should
all
celebrate
the
remarkable
growth
rate
of
juvenile
green
anacondas
.
This
is
Jordan
Diamond
,
signing
off
.
During
my
first
week
of
college
one
student
asked
me
,
you’re
Native
?
I
thought
we
killed
all
the
Natives
.
I
took
a
deep
breath
,
kindly
told
him
he
was
wrong
,
and
walked
away
.
I
wanted
nothing
more
in
that
moment
than
to
be
around
Native
people
,
to
talk
about
the
many
awkward
situations
I
faced
with
someone
who
understood
me
.
I
was
alone
,
and
for
four
years
this
has
been
my
reality
.
I
have
always
loved
Duke
.
I
grew
up
two
thousand
miles
away
from
campus
in
a
rural
community
called
Monument
Valley
,
located
on
the
Navajo
Nation
.
When
I
left
the
reservation
,
I
made
myself
one
promise
I
would
return
with
a
Duke
degree
.
My
dream
slowly
turned
into
a
nightmare
.
I
quickly
learned
that
there
were
no
classes
on
Native
American
studies
,
no
designated
space
for
Native
students
on
campus
,
no
Native
professors
,
and
no
Native
advisors
.
Most
of
my
professors
admitted
that
I
was
the
first
Native
student
they
had
ever
knowingly
taught
.
I
struggled
to
fit
in
at
a
school
that
prides
itself
on
diversity
,
yet
had
no
support
for
me
.
I
did
not
feel
comfortable
sharing
my
financial
,
academic
and
overall
Native
struggles
with
a
white
counselor
sitting
across
a
desk
trying
to
understand
me
.
How
could
I
expect
someone
who
has
never
set
foot
on
a
reservation
to
understand
my
descriptions
of
it
?
Someone
who
could
not
possibly
understand
the
intergenerational
trauma
I
learn
to
suppress
every
day
sat
across
me
advising
me
to
just
work
a
little
harder
,
or
worse
,
take
some
time
off
.
All
I
wanted
was
someone
who
understood
the
obstacles
I
was
facing
,
without
questioning
me
.
I
wanted
to
not
have
to
defend
myself
every
day
.
I
felt
like
a
ghost
.
I
walked
across
campus
dreading
every
step
to
class
because
I
couldn’t
focus
on
studying
when
I
saw
videos
of
men
and
women
sprayed
with
mace
at
Standing
Rock
and
images
of
dogs
attacking
women
and
children
.
I
feared
witnessing
history
repeat
itself
.
I
began
to
care
less
about
school
when
I
saw
yet
another
post
on
Facebook
about
an
Indigenous
women
missing
.
So
,
to
my
professors
,
I
am
sorry
if
I
am
a
little
too
distracted
to
raise
my
hand
in
class
today
.
As
the
only
Native
person
in
my
classes
,
I
am
always
held
to
an
unfair
standard
.
Numerous
times
I
was
asked
by
my
professor
to
teach
,
to
do
their
job
,
because
they
did
not
want
to
do
the
work
to
implement
Native
history
in
their
courses
.
I
have
seen
my
Native
friends
drop
out
of
Duke
because
they
did
not
have
the
support
they
needed
.
I
tried
to
fill
the
void
of
teacher
,
advisor
and
mentor
for
others
,
all
the
while
barely
staying
afloat
myself
.
I
always
contemplated
my
three
options
transfer
,
quit
,
or
persevere
.
Every
day
I
chose
the
last
,
but
it
became
harder
to
love
a
school
that
did
not
love
me
back
.
It
wasn’t
until
I
joined
the
Sanford
School
of
Public
Policy
that
I
truly
felt
seen
.
They
welcomed
me
,
never
othered
me
,
and
when
they
didn’t
have
the
resources
I
needed
as
a
Native
student
,
they
connected
me
with
organizations
that
did
and
Native
alumni
who
could
offer
me
further
guidance
.
They
never
made
me
explain
myself
or
made
me
feel
like
I
had
to
convince
them
I
belonged
there
,
because
they
were
proud
to
have
me
.
It
is
because
of
the
faculty
at
Sanford
that
I
am
here
today
,
a
senior
at
my
dream
school
.
Duke
needs
to
realize
that
there
are
Native
students
who
continue
to
struggle
because
of
the
lack
of
support
.
Duke
prides
itself
on
diversity
and
inclusion
,
yet
Native
students
are
left
out
of
this
conversation
.
There
needs
to
be
a
Native
faculty
member
,
advisor
,
counselor
and
designated
space
for
Native
students
,
because
we
cannot
continue
to
do
this
alone
.
It
has
been
disheartening
to
see
my
friends
drop
out
of
college
or
transfer
to
a
different
school
knowing
how
much
they
loved
Duke
too
.
I
have
tirelessly
worked
to
create
space
and
support
for
Native
students
through
my
role
as
an
executive
member
of
the
Native
American
Student
Alliance
and
as
the
Vice
President
of
Alpha
Pi
Omega
,
the
only
two
organizations
dedicated
to
fostering
the
growth
of
Native
students
at
Duke
.
I
tell
myself
that
perhaps
one
day
another
Navajo
student
will
step
onto
campus
,
be
welcomed
by
a
Native
community
,
and
walk
into
a
Native
student
center
where
she
has
resources
available
for
her
to
succeed
.
I
pray
one
day
she
will
not
wake
up
every
morning
convincing
herself
that
she
belongs
here
,
because
she
knows
she
does
.
I
can
think
of
more
than
one
occasion
where
I
half
jokingly
played
around
with
the
idea
of
dropping
out
of
college
during
first
semester
.
Who
doesn’t
?
When
an
endless
cycle
of
midterms
sends
your
brain
spinning
,
even
the
seemingly
sweet
embrace
of
sleep
manages
to
haunt
your
unconscious
mind
with
whispers
of
fatal
premonitions
and
red
,
bold
faced
X
s
scattered
across
your
exams
and
papers
.
Waking
in
a
cold
sweat
,
you
wonder
if
college
is
worth
the
trouble
at
all
.
Why
subject
yourself
to
the
same
duress
as
high
school
?
I
pondered
while
sitting
in
Trinity
Cafe
.
Wasn’t
college
supposed
to
be
this
never
ending
hiatus
of
fun
,
leisure
,
and
tantalizing
new
information
brimming
at
ever
corner
?
Drumming
my
fingers
on
the
table
,
I
wondered
if
university
.
I
turned
this
idea
in
my
head
for
awhile
,
blatantly
disregarding
the
fact
that
I
had
an
essay
to
write
.
And
I
don’t
know
if
it
was
the
lack
of
sleep
causing
such
unfounded
delusions
,
but
had
my
parents
not
already
paid
spring
semester
tuition
,
I
considered
pursuing
an
education
all
by
my
lonesome
.
Honestly
,
how
hard
could
it
be
?
I
reasoned
.
Setting
aside
the
value
society
places
upon
a
degree
embossed
with
Duke’s
stamp
of
approval
that
you
put
in
a
glass
frame
on
your
desk
or
hang
regally
on
the
wall
for
all
to
see
anticipating
and
secretly
gratifying
in
the
instant
praise
the
mere
mention
of
your
Alma
Mater
elicits
what
really
does
a
piece
of
paper
signify
?
Does
it
signify
a
satisfactory
completion
of
a
series
of
classes
,
assignments
,
essays
,
midterms
,
finals
?
Okay
,
even
amid
my
state
of
inertia
,
I
could
still
scrounge
up
some
common
sense
.
A
degree
opens
doors
.
Often
times
,
it’s
a
benchmark
,
a
bare
minimum
requirement
,
an
unquestioned
piece
of
information
that
you
place
at
the
tippity
top
of
your
resume
.
A
college
education
signifies
privilege
and
promise
to
employers
.
So
,
yes
,
a
degree
is
worth
something
.
But
my
sluggish
self
,
struggling
to
have
a
coherent
thought
during
those
ungodly
hours
,
wasn’t
necessarily
concerned
with
comfort
and
financial
security
.
In
fact
,
I’ve
always
secretly
wondered
if
I
was
fated
to
live
that
proverbial
starving
artist
lifestyle
.
No
,
wait
!
I
stop
mid
thought
.
I
could
do
better
.
Suddenly
recalling
the
idea
that
brought
me
down
the
rabbit
hole
of
alternative
realities
rather
than
focusing
the
one
that
I’m
actually
in
,
I
settled
on
my
destiny
nbsp
;
The
Starving
Academic
.
Ah
,
yes
.
That
suited
me
better
.
Now
,
I
have
tact
,
so
like
all
of
my
wild
fantasies
,
I
sleep
them
off
and
forget
about
it
.
I
don’t
ever
plan
on
dropping
out
,
in
fact
,
I’m
bent
on
pursuing
graduate
school
and
possibly
a
Ph
.
D
.
program
.
I
enjoy
college
,
from
the
lecture
halls
to
the
small
seminars
,
and
from
office
hours
to
conversations
with
friends
.
But
there
is
something
to
be
said
about
knowledge
acquisition
and
how
it
is
perceived
today
.
I
think
I
was
on
to
something
.
College
sometimes
gives
me
the
false
conception
that
there
is
only
one
right
way
to
acquire
information
and
in
the
pursuit
of
that
singular
form
of
knowledge
,
I’m
holding
myself
back
from
limitless
possibilities
.
And
there
are
always
caveats
at
the
expense
of
exploration
,
of
taking
classes
that
you
never
thought
you
would
have
ever
taken
,
such
as
the
integrity
of
your
GPA
,
self
esteem
relative
to
peers
who
the
information
comes
easily
to
,
and
opportunities
to
do
something
you
actually
enjoy
in
lieu
of
something
you
thought
you
might
try
out
just
because
.
However
,
there
is
no
right
way
to
learn
and
there
is
no
single
way
to
express
or
obtain
information
.
Whether
it’s
in
a
stuffy
lecture
hall
or
in
a
conversation
,
whether
it’s
in
a
library
or
in
an
online
video
,
there's
knowledge
to
be
found
everywhere
.
Being
your
own
university
doesn’t
mean
you
don’t
go
to
Duke
,
it
means
that
you
devote
yourself
to
learning
and
experiencing
life
in
its
rich
pluripotency
.
So
I
encourage
you
to
get
educated
,
not
just
at
Duke
,
but
through
whatever
life
throws
at
you
.
Avid
Chronicle
readers
are
familiar
with
the
paper’s
classic
vignette
articles
.
A
brave
author
stakes
out
at
some
corner
of
the
Duke
world
,
carefully
observing
how
Duke
students
live
.
Inspired
by
Rose
Wong’s
recent
piece
set
in
Pitchforks
,
and
devoid
of
any
other
idea
of
what
to
write
a
column
about
,
I
set
out
for
the
C1
bus
in
hopes
of
chronicling
the
rich
nighttime
conversations
I
overheard
.
What
better
location
than
this
all
important
intercampus
connection
to
see
Duke
students
in
action
?
I
went
in
with
a
vision
I
would
paint
a
literary
Van
Gogh
for
my
audience
with
rich
blue
strokes
of
descriptive
language
,
recalling
the
dialogue
taking
place
under
the
starry
night
sky
.
Over
the
course
of
a
three
hour
back
and
forth
bus
ride
through
the
night
,
I
was
sure
to
witness
firsthand
the
camaraderie
,
heartache
,
and
spirit
of
a
Thursday
night
at
Duke
from
the
limited
perspective
of
the
back
of
the
bus
and
then
artfully
retell
it
for
the
opinion
section’s
vast
readership
.
This
article
was
supposed
to
be
a
Pulitzer
contender
,
or
whatever
the
equivalent
is
for
Chronicle
opinion
columns
.
It
would
go
viral
,
getting
at
least
100
likes
on
the
Chronicle
Facebook
page
.
So
I
spent
my
Thursday
night
with
the
Notes
app
on
my
iPhone
ready
to
go
from
the
back
of
a
bus
,
ready
to
record
the
juicy
details
that
the
passengers
would
bring
me
.
I
wanted
to
capture
a
slice
of
life
,
but
I
didn’t
even
get
crumbs
everyone
that
boarded
the
bus
sat
in
silence
,
earbuds
in
,
looking
out
of
the
windows
,
presumably
in
anticipation
of
their
stops
.
I
can’t
be
sure
what
they
were
thinking
,
because
no
one
said
a
damn
word
to
each
other
.
I
thought
I
could
be
an
ethnographer
,
conducting
my
own
study
of
human
nature
on
the
bus
as
it
diffused
through
the
membranes
of
Duke’s
campuses
.
Instead
,
I
was
a
bored
college
sophomore
playing
Doodle
Jump
on
my
iPhone
.
I
wished
that
I
was
drunk
at
the
party
I
had
skipped
to
sit
on
a
bus
instead
of
sitting
on
said
bus
.
Whereas
students
should
have
been
stumbling
onto
the
vehicle
from
a
pregame
headed
to
another
party
,
loudly
talking
about
their
plans
for
the
night
in
ridiculous
costumes
,
everyone
instead
sat
in
unison
silence
.
The
partygoers
must
have
Ubered
that
night
.
On
my
long
ride
,
I
noted
the
pastel
pink
sweater
of
a
girl
headed
from
West
to
East
,
or
maybe
it
was
East
to
West
.
At
some
point
I
lost
track
of
the
bus’
orientation
.
Somehow
,
this
was
the
most
interesting
observation
I
could
make
,
because
no
one
had
anything
to
say
.
Later
I
overheard
one
guy
ask
a
girl
how
sorority
stuff
was
going
,
and
I
figured
I’d
finally
hit
the
gossip
jackpot
.
Her
response
?
Oh
,
good
.
Conversation
over
.
At
another
point
,
a
friend
sat
down
next
to
me
for
half
of
a
ride
,
and
we
made
some
light
small
talk
.
Certainly
,
this
chat
would
be
at
least
something
I
could
write
about
.
How
are
classes
going
?
Good
,
a
little
tough
,
but
,
ya
know
.
Is
the
best
we
can
do
,
people
?
Though
I
didn’t
get
the
glimpse
of
universal
truth
I
was
initially
hoping
to
see
from
my
ride
,
the
lack
of
conversation
I
witnessed
is
,
in
its
own
way
,
a
microcosm
of
the
Duke
experience
and
the
hushed
lives
that
we
live
aboard
the
Duke
transit
system
.
How
many
9
50
a
.
m
.
buses
have
we
ridden
,
headed
to
a
10
05
,
in
complete
silence
?
How
many
times
have
you
whispered
a
story
to
your
friend
next
to
you
as
you
hold
on
to
those
rubber
hand
grips
that
slide
as
the
bus
skirts
,
worried
that
everyone
else
may
hear
your
tale
?
Can
you
imagine
a
Duke
where
everyone
proudly
shouts
out
their
shame
,
the
C1
a
social
centerpiece
of
our
University
?
So
I
conclude
this
barren
reflection
with
a
request
for
the
Duke
community
let's
start
talking
on
buses
again
,
preferably
about
dramatic
gossip
and
within
hearing
range
from
me
.
I’ll
make
a
deal
I’ll
leave
the
observational
pieces
to
the
rest
of
the
Chronicle
staff
if
you
leave
me
with
just
a
of
your
relationship
drama
,
Shooters
hookup
or
classwork
struggles
.
As
we
ride
the
C1
of
life
,
let’s
remember
that
we
don’t
have
to
do
it
alone
there
are
curious
ears
all
around
,
worthy
of
a
glimpse
at
your
night
.
I’m
what
they
call
a
legacy
,
but
not
the
kind
that
gives
me
a
leg
up
in
university
admissions
.
Instead
,
it’s
one
that
means
I
would
be
judged
a
bit
less
critically
were
I
to
rush
Duke’s
chapter
of
Zeta
Tau
Alpha
,
the
sorority
my
mother
joined
in
college
.
While
I
would
have
gladly
accepted
a
boost
in
my
chances
of
admission
to
Duke
,
I
chose
not
to
cash
in
on
my
birthright
advantage
to
join
the
ZTA
sisterhood
,
nor
did
I
desire
to
rush
any
other
selective
living
group
.
Why
?
you
might
ask
,
especially
when
the
more
selective
your
social
affiliation
,
the
more
well
known
,
well
connected
,
and
socially
desirable
you
are
or
at
least
that’s
how
it
goes
at
Duke
.
Maybe
if
I
weren’t
at
Duke
,
I
would
have
decided
to
adopt
the
same
three
Greek
letters
my
mom
did
.
But
here
,
pledging
a
sorority
means
not
only
upholding
the
means
of
harsh
social
stratification
reminiscent
of
my
high
school
years
,
but
also
living
with
my
sisters
and
thereby
having
my
social
life
almost
exclusively
revolve
around
my
sorority
and
its
social
engagements
.
In
my
eyes
,
that
would
put
me
at
a
great
loss
in
embracing
the
entirety
of
what
my
college
experience
should
offer
me
exposure
to
diversity
in
all
of
its
forms
and
thus
a
bit
of
healthy
,
collegiate
discomfort
,
intellectual
stimulation
inside
outside
of
the
classroom
,
and
an
enlightened
worldview
in
which
I
could
be
humbled
by
looking
past
the
trivialities
of
title
and
appearance
and
first
impressions
that
,
as
I
have
come
to
realize
,
dominate
Duke’s
social
culture
.
If
I
were
to
live
with
a
sorority
,
or
another
selective
living
group
for
that
matter
,
my
first
year
self
worried
that
I
would
have
missed
out
on
all
of
this
.
The
truth
is
,
however
,
that
while
I
might
be
exposed
to
a
different
population
of
Duke
students
than
I
might
otherwise
have
been
were
I
to
live
in
an
SLG
,
I’m
certainly
not
benefiting
from
a
feeling
of
community
in
independent
housing
that
I
hoped
would
help
define
my
Duke
career
,
or
even
that
I
felt
during
my
first
year
in
Giles
on
East
Campus
.
A
fellow
Chronicle
columnist
who
,
it
might
be
added
,
currently
serves
as
rush
chair
of
Cooper
,
Duke’s
most
exclusive
SLG
recently
wrote
that
selective
living
groups
are
the
best
combination
of
an
inclusive
environment
and
a
strong
social
group
and
that
they
are
moving
toward
a
more
equitable
,
inclusive
version
of
social
life
at
Duke
.
While
I
appreciate
his
willingness
to
share
his
experience
with
and
take
on
SLGs
,
I
can’t
help
but
be
struck
by
his
argument
that
selectivity
.
This
kind
of
thinking
reveals
an
underlying
problem
about
the
way
we
look
at
housing
reform
at
Duke
.
nbsp
;
Is
it
that
we
are
so
used
to
social
stratification
on
campus
induced
by
numerous
factors
,
like
the
hype
around
athletics
and
the
stark

More
discontent
among
those
students
who
manage
to
acquire
a
spot
in
these
hierarchical
selective
groups
solely
for
the
sake
of
housing
,
yet
who
do
not
actually
feel
a
sense
of
belonging
in
the
group
,
are
dishing
out
hundreds
of
dollars
a
year
for
membership
,
and
are
pressured
into
supporting
but
silently
resent
the
toxic
elements
of
the
culture
such
groups
perpetuate
.
More
insecurity
and
more
feelings
of
exclusion
and
ostracism
for
friends
of
house
who
live
with
an
SLG
section
to
fill
the
University’s
dictates
regarding
bed
space
,
but
who
are
omitted
from
actual
membership
in
the
group
,
along
with
everything
from
its
social
activities
to
its
inside
jokes
.
And
finally
,
for
those
independent
students
who
are
made
to
feel
relegated
to
a
housing
situation
at
the
bottom
of
the
social
ladder
because
of
their
exclusion
from
Duke’s
premier
SLGs
and
Greek
organizations
,
a
sense
of
shame
about
where
on
campus
they
live
;
alienation
from
much
of
social
life
at
Duke
;
and
,
to
top
it
all
off
,
a
residential
community
where
RAs
desperately
try
to
organize
programming
among
a
student
population
whose
feelings
of
shame
and
alienation
prevent
them
from
engaging
with
their
dorm’s
social
life
,
which
consists
of
a
handful
of
seldom
attended
and
often
awkward
holiday
parties
and
reading
period
study
breaks
.
While
this
dismal
residential
situation
isn’t
the
case
for
independent
students
,
it
is
for
myself
and
for
almost
all
of
the
dozens
of
independent
students
to
whom
I’ve
talked
about
housing
through
my
work
on
the
executive
board
of
Duke
Students
for
Housing
Reform
DS4HR
.
It’s
naive
to
argue
that
DS4HR’s
mission
of
decoupling
selectivity
from
housing
would
necessarily
result
in
the
end
of
social
selectivity
itself
on
campus
,
a
concern
that
many
unfamiliar
with
or
averse
to
the
efforts
of
DS4HR
express
.
Greek
organizations
,
I’m
sure
,
would
still
continue
to
maintain
their
brotherhoods
and
sisterhoods
with
the
various
programming
in
which
they
engage
fraternities
would
still
have
the
multiple
off
campus
houses
they
rent
from
year
to
year
,
while
Duke’s
sororities
survived
up
until
2014
without
on
campus
housing
.
Meanwhile
,
SLGs
like
Cooper
,
Brownstone
,
Mirecourt
,
Wayne
,
and
Maxwell
would
become
,
well
,
selective
living
groups
without
the
living
part
socially
selective
groups
,
of
which
we
already
have
on
campus
that
thrive
without
university
housing
.
I
understand
and
am
sympathetic
to
the
concerns
expressed
by
Greek
organizations
and
non
Greek
SLGs
that
a
shared
housing
community
serves
as
an
integral
component
and
facilitator
of
their
group
bonding
experiences
.
However
,
both
the
countless
poignant
anecdotes
I’ve
heard
from
deeply
discontented
students
and
the
raw
numbers
themselves
make
the
harm
of
Duke’s
current
selective
housing
model
painfully
clear
.
Duke
has
a
total
undergraduate
enrollment
of
6
,
694
students
.
The
first
year
class
,
the
class
of
2022
,
has
1
,
740
students
who
all
currently
live
on
East
Campus
under
its
randomized
housing
model
.
That
leaves
5
,
254
upperclassmen
to
find
housing
between
those
who
live
with
selective
living
groups
,
who
live
off
campus
,
and
who
live
in
independent
,
non
affiliated
housing
.
According
to
Duke
Housing
and
Residential
Life
,
on
campus
housing
holds
approximately
2
,
500
beds
for
independent
students
,
which
means
that
roughly
half
of
the
upperclass
population
is
unaffiliated
when
friends
of
house
are
taken
into
consideration
.
What
exactly
do
these
numbers
imply
?
Well
,
they
reveal
that
about
half
of
the
students
thrown
into
the
chaos
inducing
,
soul
crushing
,
socially
stratifying
process
of
upperclassman
housing
selection
end
up
relegated
to
residential
spaces
where
they
aren’t
likely
to
know
the
names
of
their
dorm
mates
,
much
less
discover
a
warm
sense
of
community
.
Duke
may
try
to
have
you
think
differently
in
this
propagandized
video
produced
by
the
University
and
marketed
towards
prospective
and
first
year
Blue
Devils
that
paints
a
utopian
image
of
independent
housing
,
but
don’t
be
fooled
.
Contrary
to
Housing
and
Residential
Life’s
attempts
to
convince
the
student
body
that
independent
house
members
initiate
and
build
house
personality
and
traditions
and
focus
on
general
connection
and
community
to
create
a
place
students
can
call
home
,
I
would
venture
to
maintain
that
most
,
if
not
all
,
independent
students
would
struggle
to
identify
the
personality
of
their
house
,
to
name
even
one
of
their
house’s
traditions
,
and
to
honestly
assert
that
their
house
is
a
home
.
Admission
to
the
university
itself
is
selective
,
not
to
mention
that
nearly
every
study
abroad
program
,
research
opportunity
,
performance
group
and
student
club
or
team
engages
in
selectivity
via
applications
or
other
tests
of
one’s
qualification
for
admittance
.
If
the
overwhelming
majority
if
not
all
Duke
students
,
after
passing
the
8
.
3
percent
threshold
of
university
admissions
,
are
confronted
with
the
stinging
selectivity
of
barriers
at
every
turn
when
they
to
it
?
And
to
make
even
more
dismal
the
sad
reality
that
virtually
no
involvement
or
affiliation
on
campus
is
non
selective
,
another
columnist
who
bravely
shared
his
own
grim
rush
story
wrote
,
there
are
no
clear
qualifications
for
getting
into
a
social
SLG
or
a
Greek
organization
other
than
how
much
the
people
in
the
group
like
you
.
At
Duke
,
not
only
are
students
continuously
rejected
on
the
basis
of
their
dance
ability
or
debating
skills
,
but
they
,
too
,
face
rejection
on
the
basis
of
their
,
a
fact
they
are
made
to
face
each
time
they
venture
back
to
their
independent
house
adorned
with
a
name
like
Khaya
or
Hun
House
,
which
supposedly
hold
no
social
weight
compared
to
those
sections
donning
Maxwell
or
ΣN
.
Because
I
chose
not
to
rush
Greek
or
non
Greek
SLGs
in
the
first
place
,
I
am
consoled
knowing
that
I
was
not
rebuffed
in
the
same
way
as
many
of
my
peers
who
internalized
their
rejection
from
an
SLG
as
a
stain
on
their
character
and
a
source
of
repeatedly
reinforced
shame
.
But
I
am
deeply
troubled
by
the
trauma
that
the
brutal
rush
process
and
the
selective
housing
that
results
continue
to
inflict
on
my
peers
Duke
students
who
arrived
at
Durham’s
gothic
wonderland
,
fresh
faced
and
optimistic
about
what
their
college
years
would
offer
,
only
to
discover
that
an
on
campus
residential
community
is
a
luxury
,
not
a
right
.
For
the
few
first
years
reading
this
year’s
housing
and
rush
columns
in
The
Chronicle
,
consider
the
exorbitant
power
that
you
are
yielding
to
the
upperclass
members
of
the
SLGs
you
are
rushing
.
In
the
current
selective
housing
model
,
you
are
putting
in
their
hands
the
capacity
to
determine
your
fate
at
Duke
because
,
as
my
peer
resignedly
put
it
,
your
social
life
and
your
living
situation
are
for
better
or
for
worse
bound
together
inextricably
.
Instead
of
being
the
product
of
both
Duke’s
commitment
and
a
personal
commitment
to
inclusion
,
diversity
and
equity
,
SLGs
only
exacerbate
the
university’s
shortcomings
compared
to
peer
institutions
when
it
comes
to
efforts
towards
inclusion
,
diversity
and
equity
.
Sound
bleak
?
It
is
,
but
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
.
So
if
you’re
a
Greek
legacy
like
me
and
feel
pressured
into
rushing
this
season
for
the
sake
of
finding
community
,
don’t
.
nbsp
;
Instead
,
join
the
many
other
students
hailing
from
both
selective
and
independent
housing
backgrounds
who
are
working
to
make
our
Duke
houses
a
home
.
One
of
my
math
teachers
in
high
school
had
a
quote
on
her
wall
that
said
,
If
the
focus
is
on
learning
,
the
grades
will
follow
.
And
to
my
classmates
and
myself
,
this
was
unwelcome
advice
.
Obviously
so
.
We
did
not
want
to
delight
in
the
wonders
of
calculus
.
We
wanted
to
get
into
top
10
universities
.
Now
I
realize
the
wisdom
in
her
tackily
colorful
wall
poster
.
I
see
many
,
many
Duke
students
fixated
on
resumes
and
graduate
school
,
and
very
few
enraptured
by
the
complexities
of
the
world
unfolded
for
them
by
professors
.
I
do
not
want
to
learn
.
I
want
As
.
So
when
I
try
to
learn
,
I
don’t
care
.
And
so
I
don’t
get
As
.
But
deep
down
,
I
do
want
to
learn
!
Sometimes
I
see
the
grandeur
of
biology
,
of
molecules
fitting
together
just
so
and
comprising
the
tiniest
,
yet
most
essential
slivers
of
life
.
Why
do
I
not
sense
this
wonder
more
?
Because
I
forget
to
focus
on
learning
,
and
instead
focus
on
succeeding
.
Not
every
assignment
is
geared
towards
learning
.
Some
assignments
,
even
at
this
esteemed
institution
,
err
a
bit
too
close
to
busywork
for
my
comfort
.
Work
stops
holding
substance
and
interest
.
Everything
academic
is
a
means
to
an
end
,
a
ticket
to
high
paying
jobs
and
grad
school
.
So
studying
is
a
chore
,
and
socializing
a
brief
respite
or
in
process
distraction
from
learning
.
Isn’t
knowledge
why
we
are
here
?
Yes
,
undergrad
is
a
stepping
stone
to
bigger
and
better
things
,
but
four
years
is
a
long
time
to
be
disengaged
.
I
don’t
think
I’m
taking
the
wrong
classes
;
I
think
I
,
and
many
of
my
peers
,
have
the
wrong
mindset
.
I
don’t
let
myself
learn
happily
.
I
only
strive
to
be
a
good
grade
churning
machine
.
I
need
to
lean
in
,
and
I
need
to
love
learning
.
Only
then
will
I
both
succeed
and
be
truly
happy
.
Psychologist
Mihaly
Csikszentmihalyi
identified
a
concept
called
the
flow
state
.
The
flow
state
is
when
you
are
so
engaged
in
a
task
,
you
are
able
to
focus
so
fully
that
you
lose
track
of
time
and
achieve
full
concentrate
.
It
is
exalted
by
productivity
gurus
.
The
flow
state
allows
most
people
to
do
their
best
work
.
Being
in
the
flow
state
is
beautiful
and
comfortable
.
Yet
,
I
find
myself
less
and
less
able
to
reach
the
flow
state
in
college
.
And
I
figured
out
that
it
was
because
I
no
longer
delighted
in
learning
.
I
treated
memorizing
and
reading
textbooks
as
a
task
,
rather
than
an
exploration
.
If
I
am
stressed
or
apathetic
,
I
can’t
drift
into
a
flow
state
.
If
I
grumble
about
the
difficulty
and
unfairness
of
a
class
,
harp
on
its
weird
testing
policies
,
and
concentrate
on
my
new
text
messages
rather
than
the
knowledge
before
me
,
I
cannot
get
in
a
flow
state
.
But
being
in
a
flow
state
grants
me
the
same
amount
of
happiness
as
a
good
party
,
and
about
five
times
as
much
peace
of
mind
.
Why
then
does
my
Duke
existence
not
focus
on
learning
,
but
grades
and
extraneous
worries
?
Because
it
is
what
is
thrown
at
us
every
second
of
every
day
,
by
our
peers
,
our
parents
,
Sakai
.
Everywhere
we
look
there
is
someone
having
a
blast
while
not
doing
work
,
or
someone
making
better
grades
.
I
do
not
want
to
care
so
much
about
grades
.
They
do
not
bring
me
joy
.
I
do
want
to
love
learning
,
as
it
often
brings
me
joy
when
I
let
it
.
And
if
I
focus
on
learning
,
on
fully
exploring
the
ideas
given
to
me
by
my
pricy
education
,
it
stands
to
reason
I
should
succeed
.
It’s
not
easy
to
turn
your
back
on
the
grade
fixation
,
nor
does
it
always
seem
logical
;
it
is
what
I
determined
would
let
me
succeed
and
be
happy
.
The
human
experience
is
vast
and
complex
the
world
at
large
tenfold
so
.
One
of
the
main
missions
of
life
is
to
view
and
comprehend
a
few
bits
of
what
it
has
to
offer
.
College
is
not
the
only
way
to
do
this
,
but
if
I’m
here
and
this
is
how
I’ve
chosen
to
traverse
life
,
then
I
have
to
learn
and
enjoy
what
I’m
granted
.
If
what
I’m
learning
now
is
the
foundation
for
what
I’ll
be
doing
for
years
,
and
I
don’t
allow
myself
to
savor
its
intricacies
,
how
will
I
be
happy
in
my
career
?
My
dad
recently
told
me
that
he
had
downloaded
Grammarly
,
one
of
those
softwares
that
checks
the
grammar
of
your
emails
for
you
.
Up
until
this
point
,
ensuring
perfect
grammar
in
my
dad’s
emails
was
my
job
.
It
was
a
tedious
task
,
one
that
many
first
generation
Americans
dutifully
carry
out
at
the
request
of
their
immigrant
parents
.
I
was
hardly
a
fan
of
this
chore
.
But
what
really
frustrated
me
about
this
task
was
scrolling
through
the
conversation
to
find
that
emails
from
my
dad’s
colleagues
,
subordinates
and
supervisors
alike
were
littered
with
careless
typos
and
grammatical
transgressions
worthy
of
Donald
Trump’s
tweets
.
It
was
clear
that
the
effort
my
dad
and
I
put
into
perfecting
his
emails
was
leaps
and
bounds
beyond
that
of
his
mostly
white
,
American
colleagues
.
Time
after
time
,
I’d
ask
my
dad
why
he
bothered
to
scrutinize
every
email
when
his
colleagues
clearly
felt
no
such
obligation
.
The
response
was
always
a
variation
on
a
theme
that
is
common
to
immigrants
and
indeed
many
people
of
color
in
America
.
As
an
Indian
American
,
my
dad
felt
he
had
to
constantly
prove
that
he
belonged
in
America’s
professional
class
.
Any
slip
up
would
raise
questions
about
his
inherent
value
and
qualifications
.
A
typo
by
his
white
boss
would
hardly
raise
an
eyebrow
.
A
typo
by
my
dad
could
be
seen
as
proof
of
illiteracy
.
And
so
my
dad’s
emails
received
more
sets
of
eyes
and
much
more
attention
than
those
he
received
in
response
just
one
small
way
in
which
minorities
have
to
work
twice
as
hard
to
receive
half
the
credit
.
It’s
because
of
this
experience
this
unnecessary
burden
that
my
dad
has
completely
accepted
for
the
32
years
since
he
moved
to
America
as
a
graduate
student
that
the
email
sent
by
Megan
Neely
warning
international
students
of
the
unintended
consequences
of
not
speaking
English
in
public
has
so
infuriated
me
.
It’s
why
the
blatantly
discriminatory
behavior
of
the
two
faculty
members
who
wanted
to
blacklist
students
for
having
the
gall
to
speak
Chinese
in
public
is
so
hurtful
in
my
estimation
.
Thirty
two
years
ago
,
my
dad
was
one
of
those
graduate
students
,
likely
speaking
Gujarati
with
his
classmates
who
had
arrived
here
on
a
student
visa
just
like
him
.
The
idea
that
my
dad
and
his
friends
,
or
the
students
mentioned
in
Neely’s
email
,
should
have
taken
that
time
to
improve
their
English
is
patently
absurd
because
no
such
requirement
has
ever
been
placed
on
white
Americans
,
regardless
of
their
demonstrated
English
proficiency
or
lack
thereof
.
Indeed
,
the
assumption
that
these
students
need
to
improve
their
English
is
a
baseless
one
.
Since
when
is
the
ability
to
speak
a
foreign
language
an
indicator
of
poor
English
skills
?
To
borrow
from
the
lexicon
of
Duke’s
great
purveyor
of
linguistic
propriety
,
Megan
Neely
herself
,
I
have
the
upmost
disdain
for
this
hypocritical
and
racist
double
standard
.
The
problems
with
Neely’s
email
go
further
than
this
faux
concern
for
professionalism
and
politeness
the
two
being
ill
defined
vague
concepts
which
can
be
used
to
paint
minorities
as
less
qualified
,
much
in
the
same
way
that
Harvard
University
rated
Asian
Americans
as
lacking
in
personality
traits
according
to
a
lawsuit
against
the
university
.
There
is
also
the
problem
of
upsetting
but
unsurprising
entitlement
.
To
say
it
is
impolite
to
have
a
conversation
that
not
everyone
can
understand
implies
that
at
least
at
Hock
Plaza
,
English
speakers
are
entitled
to
understand
every
conversation
,
regardless
of
how
irrelevant
those
individuals
may
be
.
The
very
conversations
of
non
white
individuals
are
thus
colonized
.
I
hardly
need
to
mention
how
unlikely
it
is
that
Megan
Neely
and
her
two
concerned
colleagues
have
shown
such
multilingual
courtesy
when
traveling
outside
the
States
.
And
then
there
is
the
ignorance
of
the
immeasurable
worth
of
one’s
native
language
that
lies
subtly
underneath
this
incident
.
As
I
get
older
and
spend
less
time
at
home
,
I
can
feel
my
mother
tongue
slipping
away
from
me
.
I
rarely
have
the
opportunity
to
converse
in
Gujarati
and
I
worry
that
if
this
trend
continues
,
I
won’t
have
enough
of
a
grasp
on
the
language
to
share
it
with
my
future
children
.
The
inextricable
connection
of
my
language
to
my
culture
to
my
identity
makes
this
a
terrifying
prospect
.
And
this
incident
is
another
reminder
of
the
inhospitable
,
and
at
times
hostile
,
environment
in
which
diverse
Americans
aim
to
preserve
their
non
dominant
cultures
.
Is
it
that
far
a
leap
for
a
young
student
,
who
has
been
told
to
leave
their
language
at
the
door
when
entering
a
student
lounge
,
to
feel
that
passing
that
language
on
to
the
next
generation
might
actually
disadvantage
them
?
Is
it
not
an
impetus
for
cultural
erasure
that
whitened
names
lead
to
better
job
prospects
,
implying
that
foreign
names
rooted
in
foreign
languages
and
cultures
are
professional
barriers
?
Does
it
not
seem
concerning
that
the
assimilationist
rhetoric
of
Jerry
Hough
,
which
was
dismissed
by
some
as
the
rantings
of
an
older
generation
,
is
replicated
still
today
by
Duke
faculty
?
At
this
point
,
I
care
little
about
the
follow
up
to
the
incident
because
I
remain
pessimistic
that
the
sentiment
that
precipitated
Neely’s
email
can
be
changed
or
addressed
,
especially
since
it
is
likely
present
far
beyond
the
Duke
Biostatistics
and
Bioinformatics
department
.
But
I
do
want
to
make
it
clear
how
absurdly
foolish
and
ignorant
that
sentiment
is
,
and
express
my
support
to
the
students
it
was
directed
toward
.
To
them
I
say
say
whatever
you’d
like
to
say
,
wherever
,
whenever
,
and
in
whatsoever
way
you’d
like
to
.
If
the
desire
of
some
faculty
members
is
to
have
you
replicate
the
professional
behavior
of
White
America
,
that’s
a
pretty
good
way
to
start
.
You’ve
probably
read
columns
about
it
before
,
and
you’ve
most
likely
run
into
the
debate
at
least
one
time
while
being
at
Duke
which
students
are
smarter
?
Trinity
Arts
and
Sciences
students
or
Pratt
Engineering
students
?
An
age
old
question
that
invades
our
lives
and
affects
our
conversations
and
relationships
with
other
students
.
Let’s
break
it
down
.
We
have
the
workload
?
I
place
particular
emphasis
on
the
latter
question
because
most
students
act
as
if
the
difficulty
of
their
course
load
is
the
sole
measure
of
their
intellectual
capacity
.
Considering
the
factors
of
course
content
and
course
difficulty
,
answering
the
question
gets
tricky
.
Since
Trinity
contains
so
many
students
,
some
students
are
instantly
given
more
value
as
an
intellectual
since
they
partake
in
courses
that
are
perceived
as
more
difficult
.
Pre
med
students
get
a
free
pass
on
any
judgement
,
any
science
or
math
majors
are
free
of
ridicule
,
and
those
computer
science
kids
are
always
working
don’t
even
get
me
started
on
the
finance
students
.
So
,
what’s
left
?
Of
course
,
the
humanities
and
social
sciences
.
Due
to
how
Duke
students
weigh
the
relevance
and
importance
of
our
academic
pursuits
,
the
Trinity
and
Pratt
feud
really
comes
down
to
a
rivalry
between
the
humanities
social
sciences
against
STEM
.
We
live
in
society
where
science
and
technology
industries
are
expanding
rapidly
,
increasing
the
demand
for
educated
people
in
these
fields
.
A
side
effect
of
this
societal
change
is
that
dismissal
,
or
diminution
of
individuals
pursuing
their
education
in
other
the
academic
fields
.
Therefore
,
humanities
social
science
students
may
have
their
studies
view
as
not
being
as
most
of
them
time
?
Just
sit
around
reading
and
talking
?
which
equates
my
collegiate
studies
to
that
of
a
neighborhood
book
club
.
Sometimes
it
rubs
me
the
wrong
way
because
they
are
people
here
at
Duke
who
really
feel
superior
to
Trinity
students
,
particularly
to
students
studying
within
the
social
sciences
humanities
.
It
is
in
these
times
that
I
feel
the
need
to
write
this
column
.
Even
though
we
all
love
to
joke
around
and
make
sardonic
comments
about
the
untouchable
status
of
STEM
students
or
their
set
in
stone
career
paths
,
I
think
these
jokes
are
deeply
rooted
into
something
toxic
that
being
,
an
actual
sense
of
academic
classism
a
systematic
and
rigid
societal
structure
placing
certain
individuals
higher
on
a
perceived
intellectual
level
than
others
.
This
isn’t
a
shocking
notion
to
bring
up
,
considering
how
STEM
professions
are
much
more
highly
valued
in
society
in
comparison
to
professions
in
the
humanities
.
Doctors
,
engineers
,
computer
science
professionals
all
earn
much
higher
salaries
than
professors
,
publishers
,
historians
or
other
professions
within
the
world
of
humanities
,
which
skews
the
perceived
importance
of
these
individuals
social
sciences
have
a
bit
of
leeway
due
to
the
prestige
behind
being
a
politician
,
lawyer
,
etc
.
but
are
still
subjected
to
the
same
prejudice
.
Yet
,
this
division
within
the
Duke
undergraduate
population
sabotages
the
unity
Duke
so
desperately
wants
to
have
.
Additionally
,
it
is
problematic
that
we
as
Duke
students
decide
to
group
the
largest
undergraduate
school
together
and
socially
position
them
below
the
other
school
.
I’m
not
here
to
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
not
Pratt
students
are
more
capable
,
more
intelligent
,
or
more
accomplished
than
Trinity
students
,
or
vice
versa
;
I’m
here
to
dissolve
the
question
completely
.
We
are
all
here
at
Duke
University
together
.
We
all
worked
day
and
night
throughout
high
school
to
optimize
our
academic
performance
,
leading
us
to
an
elite
university
.
There
is
no
reason
to
claim
any
one
student
is
any
less
intellectual
or
capable
than
another
.
Duke
is
hard
,
and
it’s
hard
for
everyone
.
We
are
constantly
stressed
out
with
the
amount
of
work
we
have
to
accomplish
.
Whether
it
be
a
15
20
page
essay
due
tomorrow
,
a
week
long
econ
problem
set
to
finish
,
a
physics
test
worth
20
percent
of
your
grade
,
a
policy
memo
you’ve
revised
nine
times
,
or
anything
else
,
we
are
working
extremely
hard
.
It
is
essential
to
be
proud
of
your
specific
skill
set
and
your
accomplishments
.
Don’t
diminish
,
or
let
others
diminish
,
the
value
of
all
the
work
that
you’ve
completed
so
far
.
Instead
,
listen
to
one
another
as
they
share
their
perspectives
.
From
here
,
we
can
learn
more
about
each
other’s
strengths
and
weakness
so
we
can
see
each
other
as
the
intelligent
people
we
are
.
On
February
28
,
2018
,
all
masters
students
in
Duke
Biostatistics
received
an
email
from
their
director
of
graduate
studies
,
Dr
.
Megan
Neely
.
In
her
message
,
Dr
.
Neely
singled
out
international
students
and
expressed
disapproval
on
behalf
of
many
Duke
Biostatistics
faculty
regarding
their
practice
of
conversing
in
their
native
languages
while
on
break
.
Faculty
,
she
claimed
,
viewed
students
who
chose
not
to
speak
English
during
private
interactions
as
unprofessional
and
as
not
taking
their
academic
experience
seriously
.
On
January
25th
,
2019
,
Dr
.
Neely
sent
a
second
email
,
again
explicitly
requesting
that
enrolled
international
students
speak
English
100
of
the
time
when
you
are
in
Hock
or
any
other
professional
setting
.
I
acknowledge
that
Dr
.
Neely
may
merely
have
been
a
messenger
,
conveying
this
policy
on
behalf
of
the
department’s
leadership
at
large
.
However
,
the
attitudes
conveyed
show
clear
insensitivity
towards
the
international
students
to
which
they
are
addressed
.
I
strongly
suggest
that
the
Biostatistics
department
,
as
well
as
other
departments
at
Duke
,
first
examine
their
own
organizational
culture
to
identify
areas
for
potential
improvement
rather
than
dictate
the
behavior
of
students
.
If
international
students
are
primarily
mingling
together
,
doesn’t
that
suggest
that
they
do
not
feel
at
home
in
their
academic
environment
?
Perhaps
the
department
could
do
more
to
foster
camaraderie
between
international
and
domestic
students
?
Might
faculty
be
perceived
as
unapproachable
?
Could
reforms
to
the
Biostatistics
orientation
process
for
incoming
students
be
warranted
?
In
addition
,
this
unfortunate
interaction
between
faculty
and
the
international
student
body
arguably
stems
from
a
larger
problem
of
attitudes
singling
out
international
students
based
on
their
national
origin
.
The
suggestion
by
Dr
.
Neely
that
faculty
feel
threatened
when
confronted
by
conversation
that
they
cannot
understand
suggests
that
they
are
not
willing
to
trust
their
international
colleagues
.
It
is
also
ironic
for
the
Biostatistics
faculty
to
suggest
that
they
might
decline
to
work
with
international
students
due
to
communication
concerns
when
research
studies
have
demonstrated
strong
biases
in
graduate
admissions
and
other
settings
based
solely
on
the
ethnic
origin
of
applicants’
family
names
.
I
would
suggest
that
international
students
thus
already
confront
ample
bias
within
the
academy
without
veiled
threats
of
an
exclusion
policy
from
potential
research
opportunities
.
Certainly
,
it
is
true
that
herculean
efforts
by
international
students
to
master
English
while
in
America
will
likely
be
rewarded
within
the
academic
and
professional
world
.
A
long
historical
narrative
of
Western
military
,
economic
,
and
political
primacy
has
ensured
the
maintenance
of
such
a
status
quo
.
Given
these
established
norms
within
the
academy
internationally
,
it
is
entirely
reasonable
to
expect
that
professional
and
research
communications
take
place
using
English
.
However
,
it
is
ultimately
the
choice
of
international
students
alone
how
they
choose
to
confront
this
unfair
reality
outside
of
working
hours
.
Furthermore
,
the
challenge
of
integrating
into
American
academic
culture
need
not
be
an
individual
one
,
left
largely
to
the
responsibility
of
the
student
themselves
.
The
Duke
Biostatistics
department
,
as
well
as
departments
all
across
Duke
,
ought
to
be
reminded
of
their
own
responsibility
to
provide
help
and
mentorship
to
those
enrolled
within
their
programs
.
Rather
than
police
behavior
,
I
urge
them
to
find
greater
compassion
for
their
students
and
to
incorporate
constructive
feedback
and
initiatives
in
their
efforts
to
maximize
the
competitiveness
of
their
programs’
graduates
.
My
proposed
solution
is
not
an
easy
one
,
and
certainly
asks
more
of
overcommitted
faculty
than
is
required
to
compose
an
aggressively
worded
email
.
However
,
being
unable
to
do
enough
to
welcome
our
students
from
abroad
nevertheless
represents
an
immeasurable
improvement
over
making
them
feel
actively
unwelcome
at
Duke
.
I
was
amazed
to
read
about
a
member
of
the
Duke
faculty
nbsp
;
criticizing
some
Chinese
students
for
having
a
discussion
in
their
own
language
while
on
the
Duke
campus
.
nbsp
;
I
was
pleased
to
read
about
the
prompt
reaction
to
this
absurd
event
.
Most
of
the
world’s
leading
universities
have
a
somewhat
international
student
body
these
days
and
it
was
hard
to
nbsp
;
fathom
what
was
going
through
that
professor’s
mind
.
After
graduating
from
Duke
and
MIT
,
I
earned
a
Doctorate
at
the
ETH
in
Zurich
in
the
1960s
.
nbsp
;
The
primary
language
of
teaching
there
was
German
which
became
my
second
language
,
but
many
languages
were
heard
among
the
student
body
.
nbsp
;
The
native
language
of
most
of
my
colleagues
included
Swiss
German
dialect
,
German
,
French
,
and
Italian
.
Those
not
native
to
one
of
those
languages
often
spoke
English
.
An
amusing
characteristic
of
conversations
among
students
and
my
colleagues
was
that
,
in
a
given
conversation
,
words
from
two
or
three
languages
might
sometimes
be
used
in
a
single
sentence
.
Basically
,
the
first
words
that
sprang
to
mind
were
used
,
and
we
rarely
had
any
problem
nbsp
;
deciphering
the
meaning
of
that
nbsp
;
conglomeration
nbsp
;
of
words
.
I
suspect
that
the
addition
of
Chinese
to
the
language
mix
in
American
universities
has
probably
developed
mostly
in
the
last
20
years
.
Between
1981
and
2010
I
made
15
business
trips
to
China
,
adding
up
to
the
equivalent
time
spent
of
about
9
.
5
months
.
nbsp
;
My
Chinese
colleagues
were
predominantly
engineers
.
nbsp
;
Those
over
40
often
could
speak
Russian
as
a
second
language
.
Those
under
30
often
spoke
very
good
English
.
nbsp
;
Anyone
who
plans
to
work
in
a
field
which
brings
them
into
contact
with
groups
of
nbsp
;
foreigners
had
better
get
used
to
the
fact
that
they
may
frequently
find
themselves
near
groups
conversing
in
a
language
that
they
don’t
understand
a
word
of
.
If
they
are
uncomfortable
in
such
an
environment
,
there
are
three
obvious
options
.
nbsp
;
Get
an
interpreter
,
learn
an
additional
language
,
or
find
a
different
job
.

Dear
Duke
,
In
the
wake
of
my
fraternity’s
suspension
,
I
just
wanted
to
bring
up
an
issue
that
has
been
weighing
on
me
for
quite
some
time
.
Duke
University
,
in
choosing
to
unfairly
target
fraternities
for
simple
displays
of
fortitude
and
brotherhood
,
once
again
misdirects
their
efforts
and
focuses
on
the
wrong
issues
.
Here
is
the
real
issue
that
we
need
to
focus
on
this
university
,
as
an
institution
,
is
racist
towards
white
people
.
Though
many
people
may
disagree
with
me
,
I
hope
that
reading
this
column
will
show
you
the
error
of
your
ways
and
sway
you
to
see
my
correct
point
of
view
.
First
and
foremost
,
I
would
like
to
ensure
that
everyone
reading
this
column
knows
I
am
not
racist
.
I
literally
can’t
be
racist
I’m
from
New
York
,
not
the
South
.
Plus
,
I
have
black
friends
;
Chipotle
is
my
favorite
restaurant
;
I
go
to
Cabo
every
spring
break
;
and
I
don’t
even
say
the
n
word
while
listening
to
Mo
Bamba
.
I
have
a
deep
appreciation
for
all
cultures
,
and
all
I
ask
is
for
Duke
to
share
that
appreciation
.
My
culture
and
its
traditions
getting
cornrows
on
cruises
,
not
vaccinating
our
kids
,
counting
the
seconds
after
a
lightning
strike
,
and
smiling
without
teeth
when
passing
a
stranger
on
the
sidewalk
,
just
to
name
a
few
matter
too
.
Despite
Duke’s
so
called
commitment
to
diversity
,
I
struggle
to
see
any
opportunities
for
white
students
to
thrive
on
this
campus
.
We
are
lampooned
on
Duke
Memes
for
Gothicc
Teens
and
openly
criticized
in
West
Union
,
yet
are
never
provided
any
sort
of
space
or
resources
to
cope
with
such
attacks
.
I’m
just
going
to
say
it
white
students
need
safe
spaces
on
campus
,
too
.
Where’s
my
Mary
Lou
Williams
Center
?
Why
doesn’t
the
Center
for
Multicultural
Affairs
ever
host
opportunities
for
white
students
?
Sure
,
almost
every
academic
department’s
faculty
are
majority
white
,
and
literally
all
ten
former
university
presidents
are
white
,
but
what
about
everyone
else
?
I
search
and
search
for
places
to
be
myself
on
campus
,
but
it
is
obvious
that
Duke
simply
does
not
care
.
On
top
of
that
,
this
school
makes
absolutely
no
effort
to
recruit
students
from
Caucasian
backgrounds
.
Each
spring
,
I
see
first
years
arrive
on
campus
for
Latino
Student
Recruitment
Weekend
and
Black
Student
Alliance
Invitational
Weekend
.
Duke
even
just
added
a
LGBTQIA
component
to
Blue
Devil
Days
,
but
they
just
don’t
seem
to
care
about
me
as
a
white
student
.
I’m
half
Italian
,
three
sixteenths
Scottish
,
an
eighth
German
,
an
eighth
French
,
and
one
sixteenth
Swedish
.
Why
isn’t
there
a
recruitment
weekend
for
any
of
my
identity
groups
?
And
why
do
I
feel
like
if
I
asked
for
a
White
Student
Recruitment
Weekend
,
I
would
be
called
racist
?
Duke
,
your
obviously
racial
double
standards
disgust
me
and
make
me
ashamed
to
attend
this
university
.
And
then
there
are
the
student
groups
on
campus
!
I’m
a
proud
annual
attendee
of
Me
Too
Monologues
.
Each
February
,
I
love
to
watch
my
peers
beautifully
act
out
the
struggles
of
our
anonymous
classmates
.
That
being
said
,
for
the
third
year
in
a
row
,
I
submitted
a
monologue
about
how
difficult
it
is
to
be
white
at
Duke
,
and
it
was
not
selected
for
the
showcase
.
That
shocked
me
.
I
thought
the
whole
point
of
the
show
was
to
highlight
unique
viewpoints
,
especially
viewpoints
.
According
to
the
Admissions
Office’s
Class
of
2021
Profile
,
53
percent
of
the
Class
of
2021
is
diverse
.
That
means
the
class
is
47
percent
white
,
and
since
47
percent
is
less
than
50
percent
,
white
students
are
actually
in
the
minority
.
Despite
my
minority
status
,
there
is
nowhere
on
campus
where
I
am
celebrated
Lives
Matter
.
Of
course
,
they
responded
that
I
was
so
offensive
,
out
of
line
,
and
shouldn’t
be
talking
on
the
silent
floor
of
the
library
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
I
was
made
out
to
be
the
bad
guy
talk
about
blaming
the
victim
!
I
thought
the
whole
purpose
of
the
library
is
for
me
to
learn
!
If
I
can’t
even
express
my
opinion
in
a
friendly
conversation
on
the
4th
floor
of
Perkins
,
where
am
I
supposed
to
learn
about
other
people’s
views
?
At
one
of
Duke’s
events
focused
on
just
such
learning
?
Through
taking
an
ethnic
studies
course
?
By
reading
a
book
?
Even
doing
a
quick
Google
search
?
I
don’t
have
time
for
any
of
that
because
I’m
trying
to
snag
a
Goldman
Sachs
offer
without
the
benefits
of
affirmative
action
.
This
is
just
one
example
of
Duke
as
a
microcosm
of
America’s
attack
on
white
people
.
I
hope
my
column
changes
the
way
some
of
you
look
at
racism
on
campus
.
Next
time
you
laugh
at
someone
for
wearing
Vineyard
Vines
or
listening
to
EDM
too
loudly
in
Perkins
,
think
to
yourself
am
I
making
a
microaggression
?
And
to
my
fellow
white
students
,
please
know
that
I
feel
your
pain
and
see
your
struggles
.
If
you
ever
want
to
talk
,
just
meet
me
at
Cafe
everything
else
in
West
Union
is
too
spicy
.
Sincerely
,
Looking
for
a
Safe
Space
For
most
Duke
students
,
Thanksgiving
was
a
much
needed
break
from
academic
demands
,
internship
applications
,
and
general
responsibilities
that
define
our
lives
on
campus
.
But
apparently
there
is
no
rest
for
the
wicked
.
On
November
23rd
,
the
day
after
Thanksgiving
,
the
Chronicle
reported
that
posters
from
a
group
called
Identity
Evropa
appeared
on
Duke’s
campus
.
Part
of
the
broader
alt
right
movement
,
Identity
Evropa
is
one
among
many
organizations
who
hope
to
apply
lipstick
to
the
pig
of
white
nationalism
.
Calling
themselves
identitarians
,
members
of
the
group
aim
to
infiltrate
college
Republican
organizations
in
order
to
inject
white
supremacist
ideas
into
the
mainstream
.
Sadly
,
this
is
not
the
first
instance
of
hateful
people
announcing
their
presence
at
Duke
.
Less
than
a
week
before
the
Identity
Evropa
incident
,
a
swastika
was
painted
over
a
mural
devoted
to
victims
of
the
Pittsburgh
Synagogue
shooting
.
That
too
was
but
the
most
recent
incident
in
a
spate
of
anti
Semitic
attacks
that
have
repeatedly
marred
Duke’s
campus
.
In
response
to
these
hateful
events
,
various
student
groups
,
from
The
Chronicle's
independent
Editorial
Board
to
DSG
to
the
Graduate
and
Professional
Student
Council
to
the
People’s
State
of
the
University
,
have
all
called
on
the
Duke
administration
to
implement
a
robust
hate
and
bias
policy
.
As
someone
of
Jewish
heritage
,
these
acts
on
campus
pain
me
and
I
empathize
with
the
good
intentions
of
those
proposing
the
hate
speech
policy
.
But
even
though
I
understand
how
they
feel
,
I
still
don’t
think
censorship
is
the
answer
.
Let
me
admit
this
censoring
people
who
are
clearly
evil
always
sounds
good
in
the
abstract
.
After
all
,
it
is
difficult
to
dispute
that
white
supremacists
are
bad
people
and
that
we
shouldn’t
listen
to
their
speech
and
that
therefore
we
are
justified
in
censoring
.
My
issue
with
censorship
as
a
policy
is
rarely
with
the
target
of
the
censorship
pretty
much
everyone
at
Duke
would
prefer
not
to
have
white
supremacists
here
and
more
with
the
inherent
danger
of
establishing
the
power
to
forcefully
silence
others
in
the
first
place
.
Implied
in
the
notion
of
a
hate
and
bias
policy
is
the
fact
that
some
person
will
have
to
define
what
they
find
hateful
and
which
actions
are
biased
.
So
here’s
an
open
question
who
should
decide
what
the
terms
hate
and
bias
mean
?
I
understand
that
those
who
support
a
speech
code
believe
that
it
will
be
crafted
by
a
well
intentioned
,
woke
,
progressive
activist
who
will
come
up
with
the
perfect
set
of
punishments
for
hateful
speech
.
However
,
given
that
the
Duke
administration
would
be
responsible
for
enacting
and
enforcing
this
policy
,
it’s
far
more
likely
that
someone
like
Larry
Moneta
would
draw
it
up
.
Just
to
remind
everyone
,
this
is
the
same
man
who
had
two
coffee
shop
employees
fired
for
playing
what
he
called
,
and
here’s
a
keyword
,
inappropriate
rap
music
.
You
don’t
have
to
cross
the
Grand
Canyon
to
make
the
short
leap
from
inappropriate
to
hateful
.
Do
we
really
want
Larry
Moneta’s
standards
for
what
is
appropriate
regulating
what
students
can
say
and
do
on
campus
?
Because
that
will
be
the
result
of
a
codified
hate
speech
policy
.
Furthermore
,
I
don’t
understand
how
these
calls
for
the
Duke
administration
to
censor
students
are
coming
from
groups
like
The
Chronicle's
independent
Editorial
Board
.
In
their
editorial
,
Fascism
and
the
impulse
to
surveil
,
the
board
implies
Vincent
Price
and
the
Duke
administration
are
fascists
,
accuses
universities
like
ours
nbsp
;
of
being
active
facilitators
for
white
supremacy
,
and
says
the
gesture
of
surveillance
is
most
likely
meaningless
without
a
robust
hate
and
bias
policy
.
To
be
totally
clear
,
the
Chronicle's
independent
Editorial
Board
wants
an
organization
that
they
regard
as
complicit
with
fascism
and
racism
to
enact
a
censorship
policy
for
all
students
at
Duke
.
The
Editorial
Board
has
a
radical
tendency
in
everything
they
write
and
in
this
case
they
are
radically
incoherent
.
nbsp
;
My
proposed
solution
is
simple
,
but
not
particularly
satisfying
no
one
should
get
to
regulate
how
other
people
speak
.
What
is
and
is
not
offensive
is
a
wholly
subjective
argument
and
any
attempt
to
enforce
subjectivity
in
the
form
of
policy
opens
up
rampant
potential
for
abuse
.
I
have
no
confidence
that
the
Duke
administration
would
regulate
speech
in
a
non
abusive
manner
because
I
have
no
confidence
that
anyone
can
regulate
speech
in
a
non
abusive
manner
.
Instead
,
we
as
a
community
should
call
out
hate
where
we
see
it
,
shun
and
ostracize
those
who
perpetuate
it
,
and
work
together
to
create
an
inclusive
discourse
at
Duke
.
The
power
to
create
a
better
Duke
lies
in
our
hands
and
we
,
the
students
of
Duke
University
,
shape
the
conversation
at
our
school
.
We
should
use
our
collective
social
influence
to
discourage
bad
ideas
and
promote
good
ones
rather
than
trying
to
relegate
the
ability
to
shape
discourse
to
the
Duke
administration
.
We
have
more
power
than
we
give
ourselves
credit
for
.
When
I
first
saw
the
title
of
Ali
Thursland’s
column
on
financial
privilege
at
Duke
,
I
was
excited
that
someone
had
taken
the
time
to
address
a
struggle
most
Duke
students
aren’t
aware
of
unless
they’re
experiencing
it
themselves
.
nbsp
;
But
after
reading
the
column
,
I
found
myself
deeply
disappointed
by
it
.
This
article
has
belittled
the
experience
of
being
financially
underprivileged
at
Duke
to
being
unable
to
do
cool
kid
things
with
the
Duke
elite
.
nbsp
;
Her
focus
on
aspects
of
nightlife
and
party
culture
at
Duke
such
as
the
expense
of
one
time
use
outfits
,
Juul
pods
,
alcohol
,
and
cover
charges
at
clubs
completely
misses
the
daily
struggle
and
social
implications
that
students’
financial
situations
have
placed
on
every
aspect
of
life
.
Equitable
access
to
Greek
life
and
other
selective
living
groups
on
campus
is
a
significant
social
issue
.
nbsp
;
I
won’t
deny
that
.
nbsp
;
The
networking
and
career
opportunities
that
students
access
through
their
affiliations
with
exclusive
social
groups
like
Greek
life
and
SLGs
place
less
wealthy
students
like
me
at
a
disadvantage
.
But
my
daily
life
at
Duke
isn’t
solely
defined
by
my
non
involvement
in
an
SLG
or
sorority
.
nbsp
;
I
and
many
of
your
peers
face
social
issues
more
fundamental
than
the
ability
to
afford
alcohol
.
Of
Duke’s
undergraduate
student
body
,
69
percent
of
them
come
from
families
in
the
top
20
percent
.
nbsp
;
On
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
,
only
12
percent
of
them
received
Pell
Grants
a
federal
subsidy
provided
to
students
with
financial
need
in
2015
.
nbsp
;
Students
from
this
demographic
don’t
have
the
ability
to
impulsively
spend
60
every
weekend
on
entertainment
,
and
their
financial
struggles
don’t
disappear
when
they
abstain
from
Duke’s
party
culture
.
The
social
ramifications
of
being
financially
underprivileged
at
Duke
involve

Spring

they
can’t

It

it’s

Economic

West
Campus
dorms
are
divided
between
independent
houses
and
sections
for
fraternities
,
sororities
and
selective
living
groups
.
This
time
last
year
,
the
Chronicle
published
a
column
called
In
defense
of
Greek
life
.
In
it
,
the
columnist
attempts
to
dispel
the
commonly
held
beliefs
that
Greek
life
is
nothing
more
than
homogeneity
and
a
good
barn
party
.
He
does
a
convincing
job
describing
why
the
Greek
life
may
not
deserve
the
stereotypically
bad
rap
students
are
quick
to
give
it
.
Since
that
article
was
published
,
however
,
I
have
seen
another
aspect
of
Duke’s
social
scene
become
the
butt
of
many
jokes
selective
living
groups
.
Housing
and
Residence
Life
defines
non
Greek
SLGs
as
student
initiated
communities
that
can
be
purely
social
in
nature
or
based
upon
some
fundamental
intellectual
or
cultural
theme
.
And
since
I
am
a
student
in
one
of
these
student
initiated
communities
,
I
want
to
use
this
opportunity
to
dispel
a
few
myths
about
SLGs
and
make
my
case
for
a
different
side
of
Duke
social
life
.
I
believe
selective
living
groups
are
the
best
combination
of
an
inclusive
environment
and
a
strong
social
group
.
From
the
rush
process
to
the
internal
make
up
to
the
way
they
socialize
,
SLGs
are
moving
toward
a
more
equitable
,
inclusive
version
of
social
life
at
Duke
.
Here’s
my
argument
for
selective
living
groups
SLGs
Cooper
specifically
have
come
under
fire
for
the
way
new
members
are
recruited
and
selected
.
The
main
complaint
is
that
,
in
just
three
weeks
,
it’s
hard
to
get
to
know
hundreds
of
rushees
well
enough
to
decide
which
20
or
30
get
bids
,
and
which
will
be
left
out
in
the
cold
.
Granted
,
the
three
week
rush
process
the
University
mandates
for
SLGs
forces
them
to
,
no
pun
intended
,
rush
through
recruitment
.
I
believe
,
however
,
that
in
those
three
weeks
,
SLGs
are
able
to
host
a
variety
of
events
that
benefit
people
with
different
personality
types
,
backgrounds
and
interests
in
the
attempt
to
make
rush
as
equitable
as
possible
.
Rush
committees
spend
months
trying
to
figure
out
the
most
efficient
and
fair
way
to
meet
hundreds
of
first
years
,
get
to
know
them
on
some
level
,
and
decide
who
is
offered
a
bid
.
Moreover
,
the
deliberation
process
in
most
SLGs
requires
intense
discussion
among
house
members
rather
than
a
computerized
algorithm
.
Sure
,
the
rush
process
isn’t
perfect
.
But
a
simple
glance
at
Brownstone
,
Cooper
,
Mirecourt
or
Maxwell’s
calendar
shows
the
result
of
countless
hours
of
thought
and
effort
put
towards
improving
the
recruitment
system
.
At
the
end
of
the
process
,
SLGs
have
to
make
cuts
.
While
receiving
my
own
rejection
emails
my
first
year
stung
,
I
have
come
to
realize
that
those
decision
were
not
a
rejection
of
me
as
a
person
,
rather
a
rejection
out
of
necessity
and
that
in
all
honesty
I
can
still
be
friends
with
people
in
SLGs
whose
last
email
to
me
began
with
We’re
sorry
.
If
you
find
yourself
insulated
in
a
space
where
the
overwhelming
majority
of
people
share
your
identity’s
most
defining
characteristics
,
chances
are
you
aren’t
pushing
yourself
to
grow
beyond
your
comfort
zone
.
Granted
,
there
are
SLGs
for
where
people
of
similar
marginalized
identities
can
find
solace
in
a
safe
space
these
are
the
exception
.
But
if
you’re
looking
around
at
a
mixer
and
can’t
point
out
someone
different
than
yourself
,
you
might
not
be
taking
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
expand
your
social
network
to
the
fullest
extent
.
Sure
,
you
may
be
meeting
new
people
,
but
do
those
people
challenge
you
to
become
a
better
student
and
person
?
One
of
the
biggest
benefits
of
SLGs
is
how
they
have
evolved
to
all
prioritize
different
types
of
diversity
.
At
any
given
SLG
you’re
sure
to
find
members
across
the
gender
spectrum
,
members
of
vastly
different
ethnic
and
racial
backgrounds
,
members
across
income
levels
,
and
members
with
varying
sexual
orientations
.
The
result
goes
beyond
the
novelty
of
appearing
inclusive
.
Some
of
my
most
educational
moments
at
Duke
have
come
from
living
with
people
with
backgrounds
I
never
would
have
encountered
if
we
didn’t
live
down
the
hall
from
one
another
.
Of
course
,
this
sort
of
learning
can
take
place
outside
of
social
living
arrangement
.
But
living
in
an
environment
that
easily
facilitates
the
conversations
I
came
to
college
to
have
makes
learning
so
much
more
enjoyable
.
When
I
came
into
Duke
,
my
idea
of
a
party
involved
a
packed
basement
,
cheap
alcohol
,
and
a
power
imbalance
between
those
throwing
the
party
and
those
invited
.
My
O
Week
escapades
only
confirmed
my
suspicions
.
While
Greek
parties
may
seem
to
be
more
open
than
most
SLG
parties
as
Greek
organizations
have
exponentially
more
money
to
spend
on
being
your
go
to
party
guys
SLG
parties
dismantle
the
reliance
on
men
for
both
the
place
and
the
alcohol
to
get
the
party
going
.
When
SLGs
ramp
up
for
a
good
Friday
night
,
the
social
power
is
shared
across
members
as
no
one
person
holds
a
place
or
the
drinks
at
ransom
.
At
the
very
first
SLG
party
I
went
to
,
I
was
reminded
that
I
did
not
have
to
drink
if
I
did
not
want
to
more
times
than
I
could
count
.
Instead
of
the
classic
beer
pong
,
House
members
played
with
water
so
that
people
who
usually
avoid
the
table
could
feel
included
.
Beyond
the
parties
,
SLGs
have
just
as
many
non
drinking
centered
events
,
like
class
lock
ins
or
House
dinners
that
are
meant
to
bring
the
House
together
in
a
more
wholesome
way
.
Here
at
Duke
,
your
social
life
and
your
living
situation
are
for
better
or
for
worse
bound
together
inextricably
.
Barring
outside
circumstances
,
the
decision
you
make
in
January
of
your
first
year
determines
your
social
calendar
for
the
next
three
years
.
SLGs
are
the
social
product
of
both
Duke’s
commitment
and
a
personal
commitment
to
inclusion
,
diversity
and
equity
.
And
,
hey
,
you
get
a
few
great
parties
out
of
it
too
.
Why
don’t
you
look
it
up
for
homework
today
?
was
the
response
of
my
elementary
school
teacher
whenever
I
raised
my
hand
with
a
question
too
big
to
answer
,
ones
like
When
does
infinity
end
?
,
Who
put
a
hole
in
the
ozone
?
and
What
makes
the
internet
work
?
My
teacher
would
deflect
as
a
way
of
saying
I
don’t
know
without
actually
admitting
it
.
A
decade
later
,
now
in
college
,
I
am
sitting
in
a
biochemistry
lecture
and
my
professor
began
to
talk
about
a
disease
for
which
doctors
and
scientists
haven’t
found
a
cause
for
.
When
a
classmate
raised
their
hand
to
ask
about
why
it
occurs
in
humans
,
Professor
Coggins
responded
by
saying
I
don’t
actually
know
.
Scientists
and
doctors
haven’t
been
able
to
find
a
cause
for
what
is
happening
in
our
bodies
.
In
almost
four
years
of
college
,
that
was
the
first
time
I
had
ever
heard
a
faculty
member
admit
that
the
answer
wasn’t
certain
,
or
explainable
,
or
reachable
through
hard
work
and
a
Ph
.
D
.
dissertation
.
But
I’ve
found
that
if
you
listen
harder
,
encoded
ways
of
saying
I
don’t
know’
appear
all
throughout
our
professional
language
.
In
fact
,
there
are
hundreds
of
scientific
terms
for
we
haven’t
got
a
clue
.
’
When
doctors
can't
determine
the
cause
for
a
disease
that
arises
spontaneously
they
call
it
idiopathic
.
Physicists
use
the
term
fudge
factors
in
order
to
account
for
unanticipated
differences
between
theory
and
experiment
.
Chemists
attribute
unexplained
results
of
a
reaction
to
a
combination
of
electronic
and
steric
effects
.
Statisticians
label
data
points
that
don’t
fit
into
the
trend
as
outliers
.
Programmers
just
call
it
a
computer
error
and
move
on
.
Astronomers
write
about
the
contamination
of
an
unknown
origin
,
which
is
probably
science
speak
for
aliens
.
Language
encoding
the
phenomenon
of
not
knowing
isn’t
only
limited
to
science
.
When
archaeologists
don’t
know
how
to
classify
an
object
from
the
ancient
past
,
they
say
it
was
used
for
ritual
purposes
.
Artists
call
their
works
untitled
,
and
art
historians
label
them
as
avant
garde
.
Librarians
file
items
under
miscellaneous
.
When
journalists
can’t
make
out
words
from
a
transcription
,
they
label
it
inaudible
.
Poets
just
leave
a
bunch
of
empty
spaces
.
Academics
write
that
some
questions
are
outside
the
scope
of
this
paper
.
In
religion
,
what
is
beyond
human
understanding
is
usually
called
a
holy
mystery
,
but
could
also
be
condensed
into
one
really
small
word
God
.
We
resort
to
so
many
shorthand
phrases
to
cover
up
the
big
,
gaping
hole
in
what
we
are
certain
of
.
I’m
quick
to
fall
back
on
this
code
,
too
.
My
most
used
emoji
is
the
smiley
face
with
its
eyebrows
raised
and
hands
gesturing
a
nice
big
shrug
.
Translation
I
have
no
clue
.
When
an
acquaintance
asks
me
where
I’ll
be
working
after
graduation
,
I’ll
say
,
I’m
looking
at
a
few
options
.
Translation
I
have
no
idea
.
How
many
times
have
you
not
known
the
answer
to
a
question
on
a
test
,
only
to
scrape
together
a
series
of
formulas
or
nonsense
sentences
to
try
to
cover
it
up
?
There
is
a
consequence
for
not
knowing
,
and
as
I
get
older
that
stakes
seem
to
get
higher
.
So
often
we
try
to
mask
what
we
don’t
know
or
can’t
know
with
language
or
formulas
or
emojis
as
a
placeholder
,
because
it’s
easier
to
hide
behind
our
own
human
lack
of
understanding
with
words
and
phrases
like
the
ones
listed
.
But
I
also
think
we
use
other
words
to
describe
what
we
don’t
know
out
of
the
fear
that
we
might
never
,
ever
know
.
Perhaps
this
recognition
of
the
gap
in
our
knowledge
is
the
first
in
a
series
of
steps
pointing
towards
discovery
.
Senior
year
has
felt
like
one
long
metaphor
for
I
don’t
know’
repeated
over
and
over
again
.
No
one
prepares
you
for
how
scary
it
is
,
arriving
at
the
end
of
four
years
in
college
without
a
clue
of
where
to
go
from
here
.
After
all
,
who
made
it
a
rule
by
the
time
we
are
22
years
old
,
we
should
have
all
of
the
unknowns
who
we
are
,
where
we
will
live
,
who
we
will
love
figured
out
?
When
I
unpacked
my
bags
in
Southgate
almost
four
years
ago
,
my
original
goal
was
to
figure
out
the
answers
to
all
of
these
questions
.
Find
my
passion
,
fall
in
love
,
pick
a
city
,
get
a
job
,
checking
off
all
the
correct
boxes
of
achievement
along
the
way
.
Now
,
in
my
last
semester
of
college
,
my
new
goal
is
just
to
finish
.
As
I
go
,
I’ll
be
repeating
I
don’t
know
as
many
times
as
it
takes
.
My
favorite
phrase
for
the
uncertain
is

Looking
around
at
the
path
before
me
as
I
am
about
to
graduate
from
college
,
there
are
a
lot
of
dragons
.
Pretty
much
nothing
but
dragons
.
Not
knowing
what
my
future
looks
like
invites
doubt
,
but
also
leaves
so
much
room
for
risk
,
and
courage
,
and
love
.
And
I’m
excited
to
see
what
messy
,
beautiful
things
I
discover
along
the
way
.
When
Juliet
proclaims
her
love
for
Romeo
,
she
says
,
What’s
in
a
name
?
That
which
we
call
a
rose
By
any
other
name
would
smell
as
sweet
.
In
Chinese
,
my
last
name
Liu
刘
is
pronounced
líu
,
similar
to
how
you’d
pronounce
the
English
word
lieu
.
Yet
,
in
the
first
18
years
of
my
existence
,
I
had
always
pronounced
it
like
the
Romanized
loo
it
just
wasn’t
worth
the
effort
to
correct
people
.
During
the
first
semester
of
my
freshman
year
,
my
friend
Zoe
pronounced
my
last
name
the
way
it
should
be
pronounced
,
and
I
was
shook
.
Why
was
I
so
surprised
that
someone
actually
got
my
name
right
?
Juliet
wasn’t
so
right
.
A
rose
by
any
other
name
can
become
something
else
entirely
,
constructed
and
molded
by
the
connotations
that
each
word
inherently
carries
.
The
Romanization
and
Anglicization
of
foreign
words
in
particular
,
and
especially
words
as
close
to
your
heart
as
your
family
name
,
have
important
societal
implications
that
are
too
often
swept
under
the
rug
.
When
I
order
the
Shanghai
bowl
from
Ginger
amp
;
Soy
,
I
always
find
myself
pronouncing
it
differently
than
the
time
before
sometimes
it’s
the
standard
Shanghai
,
and
other
times
,
it’s
shàng
hăi
with
the
correct
tonal
inflections
.
You’d
think
a
bowl
of
orange
chicken
wouldn’t
make
me
think
so
hard
.
While
I
want
to
remain
as
true
to
the
Chinese
language
as
possible
out
of
some
obscure
sense
of
duty
to
my
family’s
heritage
,
part
of
me
thinks
I
should
just
stick
with
the
Anglicized
Shanghai
it’s
orange
chicken
,
after
all
.
But
surely
my
family
name
deserves
more
thought
than
a
bowl
of
orange
chicken
.
I
spent
winter
break
in
China
,
and
I
noticed
that
in
the
audio
recordings
on
the
metro
,
the
English
version
says
the
names
of
destinations
with
correct
Chinese
pronunciation
.
One
can
hope
that
English
speaking
visitors
are
able
to
match
up
the
proper
pronunciation
with
the
name
of
the
stop
that
they’re
looking
for
.
The
pinyin
of
Chinese
that
is
displayed
on
metro
maps
is
pretty
intuitive
,
but
for
those
that
don’t
find
it
so
easy
,
this
correct
pronunciation
could
prove
to
be
a
real
hurdle
.
But
what
if
the
main
purpose
of
language
is
simply
to
communicate
,
not
to
influence
?
In
that
case
,
perhaps
the
optimal
strategy
in
pronunciation
is
to
accommodate
the
listener
and
to
pronounce
words
the
way
that
people
expect
them
to
be
heard
,
rather
than
the
correct
pronunciation
.
Think
about
all
the
people
who
adopt
aliases
when
they
place
an
order
at
Starbucks
suddenly
Sachit
becomes
Sal
,
and
Jiachen
becomes
JC
.
Maybe
this
act
is
a
win
win
situation
,
making
the
situation
easier
for
both
the
barista
and
for
themselves
.
This
whole
ordeal
has
become
a
common
joke
among
people
who
share
names
that
are
often
butchered
by
those
unfamiliar
with
the
language
.
In
a
trailer
for
The
Patriot
Act
with
Hasan
Minhaj
,
Tan
France
,
whose
own
name
is
simplified
from
Tanweer
,
says
to
Hasan
,
I
hear
people
pronouncing
it
Has
an
Min
aj
.
I’m
almost
positive
that’s
not
how
we
say
it
.
Hasan
replies
,
Well
,
it’s
a
brown
thing
.
There
is
no
Has
an
Min
aj
.
That’s
my
Clark
Kent
.
But
in
this
nonfictional
world
,
why
do
we
have
to
keep
Clark
Kent
and
Superman
separate
?
Perhaps
this
was
always
a
subconscious
exercise
in
self
preservation
.
Researchers
have
found
that
people
with
easier
to
pronounce
names
tend
to
be
evaluated
more
positively
than
people
with
harder
to
pronounce
names
.
When
a
name
rolls
off
the
tongue
easily
,
we
tend
to
associate
a
positive
sentiment
with
it
.
And
it’s
easier
for
me
to
just
tell
someone
to
pronounce
my
last
name
the
same
way
that
they
would
naturally
read
it
off
a
page
.
There
are
certain
phonemes
that
don’t
exist
in
English
,
but
do
exist
in
other
languages
.
To
people
who
only
speak
English
,
these
languages
will
sound
not
just
harsh
and
grating
,
but
also
unnatural
.
If
you
type
why
does
Chinese
sound
in
Google
,
the
first
few
auto
generated
results
to
finish
that
phrase
are
angry
,
funny
and
different
.
People
associate
a
negative
sentiment
with
these
foreign
words
,
which
is
ultimately
grounded
in
a
discomfort
with
the
unknown
.
In
this
sense
,
language
is
a
vehicle
through
which
Asian
culture
and
more
have
been
other
ized
.
The
way
that
other
people
have
pronounced
my
name
back
to
me
,
along
with
the
greater
surrounding
dialogue
surrounding
Chinese
culture
,
has
undoubtedly
shaped
my
own
perception
of
the
Chinese
language
and
as
a
result
,
my
perception
of
myself
.
I
can
see
this
in
the
way
that
I
inadvertently
cringe
when
I
hear
the
sharpness
of
some
Chinese
words
or
in
the
way
that
I
wrongly
associate
aggressiveness
with
certain
dialects
.
But
then
I
consciously
stop
myself
and
I
think
about
the
street
markets
in
China
,
lined
with
hawkers
shouting
in
Chinese
,
or
the
Chinese
poems
I
memorized
as
a
kid
,
and
I
remember
the
beauty
of
a
language
that
has
so
often
been
demonized
.
In
reality
,
I
don’t
care
about
how
you
pronounce
my
name
.
And
some
people
always
get
their
names
mispronounced
.
I’m
more
concerned
with
the
implications
of
what
it
means
for
others
to
be
so
unfamiliar
with
a
culture
,
and
perhaps
more
importantly
,
to
refuse
to
learn
about
the
culture
of
another
person
and
by
extension
,
this
person’s
identity
.

If
language
is
the
medium
through
which
we
may
define
and
perceive
identity
,
maybe
Emily
刘
isn’t
the
same
person
as
Emily
Liu
.
In
which
case
,
I
have
to
ask
myself
which
one
am
I
?
In
the
past
few
years
,
anti
politically
correct
PC
movements
have
grown
in
popularity
and
vigor
.
Groups
of
young
college
conservatives
have
criticized
the
liberal
hold
on
universities
and
conservative
activists
have
mocked
censorship
and
sensitivity
among
young
millennials
.
The
sentiment
that
people
get
offended
by
anything
these
days
seems
to
be
growing
among
the
larger
population
.
Scandals
of
comedians
getting
booted
from
gigs
for
racially
insensitive
remarks
or
being
fired
from
hosting
an
awards
ceremony
due
to
old
homophobic
tweets
have
sparked
discussion
over
whether
PC
culture
has
gone
too
far
.
Even
at
Duke
,
students
and
professors
complain
about
the
PC
culture
on
campus
.
Politically
correct
means
non
offensive
and
non
controversial
.
As
racial
minorities
and
niches
of
LGBT
communities
gain
political
clout
,
the
amount
of
identity
factors
that
we
are
exposed
to
increases
.
Some
appreciate
this
diversity
,
while
others
see
this
diversity
as
more
people
they
can’t
offend
.
The
anti
PC
culture
of
arguing
that
people
get
offended
too
easily
shifts
blame
on
an
individual’s
surroundings
,
and
away
from
the
individual
who
was
offensive
or
careless
with
their
words
.
It
makes
political
correctness
seem
like
society’s
flaw
,
and
that
the
individual
holds
no
responsibility
for
their
words
and
how
their
words
make
people
feel
.
I
view
political
correctness
as
an
opportunity
to
connect
to
a
broader
range
of
people
.
I
do
not
see
it
as
a
restriction
.
My
life
experiences
have
not
specifically
taught
me
the
struggles
of
other
racial
,
sexual
,
and
gender
minorities
.
However
,
I
do
know
respectful
language
,
or
PC
terms
,
that
members
of
certain
communities
ask
outsiders
to
use
.
In
an
institution
such
as
Duke
,
we
are
surrounded
by
an
extremely
diverse
population
.
Through
being
politically
correct
,
I
can
make
my
words
accessible
to
and
respectful
of
a
larger
amount
of
my
peers
at
Duke
,
instead
of
solely
people
with
similar
life
experiences
to
mine
.
Being
ignorant
to
different
identities
shuts
out
people
from
hearing
your
message
,
and
it
dwindles
your
audience
.
A
few
weeks
ago
,
Kevin
Hart
was
dropped
from
his
hosting
gig
at
the
Oscars
due
to
a
resurfacing
of
tweets
using
the
word
f
g
as
well
as
a
joke
about
him
beating
his
son
up
with
a
dollhouse
if
he
turned
out
to
be
gay
.
Many
,
including
Ellen
DeGeneres
,
defended
the
comedian
,
arguing
that
these
were
old
jokes
from
years
ago
.
The
issue
was
not
that
society
had
somehow
decided
to
be
offended
by
Kevin
Hart
.
Rather
,
Kevin
Hart
decided
in
those
years
to
exclude
gay
people
from
his
audience
by
making
them
the
target
of
those
jokes
.
He
lost
that
community
as
a
potential
fan
base
as
a
direct
result
of
his
choice
to
make
homophobic
comments
.
When
I
was
in
middle
school
,
I
said
plenty
of
offensive
things
.
I
pushed
boundaries
and
ignored
political
correctness
often
.
But
then
I
grew
up
.
I
learned
about
the
experiences
of
people
different
me
.
And
I
didn’t
become
politically
correct
because
society
or
this
liberal
university
pressured
me
,
but
because
I
gained
more
empathy
for
certain
communities
.
I
dropped
about
10
12
words
from
vocabulary
,
including
words
like
retarded
and
ghetto
.
I
have
not
lost
any
ability
to
communicate
my
ideas
or
thoughts
from
my
political
correctness
.
I
still
make
mistakes
,
but
with
good
intentions
I
never
feel
like
I
have
to
worry
.
I
understand
that
it
can
be
difficult
to
use
the
correct
vocabulary
in
an
academic
environment
focused
on
social
justice
.
I
also
believe
that
criticisms
of
political
correctness
are
borne
out
of
a
nostalgia
for
past
eras
where
racist
,
sexist
and
homophobic
comment
were
more
commonplace
.
It
is
important
for
us
to
take
ownership
of
our
words
,
and
understand
that
our
message
reaches
the
audiences
we
choose
for
it
.
I
don’t
want
people
to
monitor
their
language
to
fit
within
a
societal
rule
book
.
Instead
,
I
want
us
to
understand
the
perspective
of
affinity
groups
and
learn
how
our
words
impact
their
communities
.
This
way
,
we
can
implement
socially
conscious
language
from
a
genuine
desire
to
be
more
respectful
,
rather
than
an
obligation
to
adhere
to
a
set
of
rules
.
Learning
to
be
non
offensive
takes
patience
.
People
will
get
angry
at
you
for
things
you
have
been
saying
for
your
entire
life
.
Instead
of
resorting
to
defensiveness
,
try
to
understand
where
their
anger
is
coming
from
.
For
minority
groups
,
this
anger
can
come
directly
from
life
experiences
.
It
takes
a
strong
will
to
step
back
and
realize
that
what
you
have
said
is
truly
hurtful
,
and
it
is
easy
to
dismiss
others’
anger
as
a
societal
flaw
.
But
when
you
learn
to
re
evaluate
your
words
in
that
way
,
you
expand
your
own
opportunities
for
knowledge
.

As
a
first
year
student
at
Duke
,
I
was
often
warned
with
distaste
and
a
strange
gravity
of
life
on
Central
Campus
.
Sophomores
would
shake
their
heads
disapprovingly
at
the
mere
mention
of
their
housing
,
citing
moldy
apartments
,
broken
faucets
,
and
an
irregular
bus
schedule
that
quite
literally
dictated
every
minute
of
their
days
,
as
proof
of
Central’s
inadequacy
.
The
apartments
are
too
old
,
I
would
hear
,
it’s
in
the
middle
of
Central
residents
would
shiver
.
I’d
shiver
too
,
of
course
.
The
thought
of
forfeiting
a
10
second
walk
to
the
bus
stop
,
where
one
can
always
find
a
C1
,
a
45
second
walk
to
Lilly
Library
,
Marketplace
,
and
Trinity
Café
,
and
a
two
minute
walk
to
a
fully
equippedgym
was
simply
unimaginable
.
Sure
enough
,
as
May
rolled
around
and
finals
came
to
a
welcome
end
,
my
friends
and
I
tearfully
parted
with
our
freshmen
dorms
,
mourning
the
loss
of
our
quintessential
college
campus
all
the
way
through
August
.
But
this
is
not
a
eulogy
for
East
Campus
.
This
is
a
declaration
of
surprise
,
an
apology
for
my
initial
doubt
,
and
sincere
appreciation
for
the
community
that
Central
Campus
has
given
me
.
On
a
hot
and
sweaty
day
in
August
,
I
pulled
into
the
parking
lot
of
my
new
but
old
looking
Central
Campus
apartment
,
the
car
stuffed
with
clothing
,
school
supplies
,
and
all
the
little
accumulations
that
I
couldn’t
bear
to
throw
out
at
the
end
of
my
first
year
.
I
had
just
finished
an
eight
and
a
half
hour
drive
,
and
I
was
,
simply
put
,
in
a
mood
.
Yet
,
as
I
climbed
out
of
the
car
and
surveyed
my
surroundings
,
I
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
surge
of
excitement
.
In
every
direction
,
students
were
spiritedly
reuniting
with
their
friends
,
sitting
in
the
grass
and
enjoying
Durham’s
summer
,
throwing
footballs
,
and
greeting
everyone
they
passed
.
Unlike
East
Campus
,
where
large
dorms
are
spread
out
around
a
sprawling
green
quad
,
the
Central
Apartments
are
small
and
close
together
.
Some
people
may
be
turned
off
by
this
design
,
craving
the
collegiate
,
picturesque
landscape
famed
to
East
Campus
.
However
,
as
I
stood
on
my
balcony
and
spotted
a
close
friend
exiting
her
apartment
two
buildings
over
,
Central
radiated
a
sort
of
intimacy
and
hominess
that
made
this
second
year
transition
infinitely
easier
.
A
major
contributor
to
this
sense
of
community
and
comfort
is
Thrive
,
the
dining
hall
on
Central
Campus
.
Anyone
who
knows
me
can
affirm
that
I
embody
the
phrase
breakfast
is
the
most
important
meal
of
the
day
.
Each
morning
,
as
I
pull
myself
from
bed
with
just
enough
time
to
grab
breakfast
before
class
,
I
am
welcomed
into
Thrive
by
an
array
of
familiar
faces
.
There
is
always
someone
to
talk
to
or
someone
to
meet
,
a
closeness
that
is
only
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
the
incredible
Thrive
staff
has
memorized
the
names
of
almost
every
student
on
this
campus
.
It
may
be
a
small
comfort
,
but
when
my
roommates
have
already
left
by
the
time
I
wake
up
and
Apryl
at
Thrive
is
my
first
conversation
of
the
day
,
it’s
gratifying
to
know
that
that
this
small
exchange
will
memorably
impact
both
of
our
days
.
All
of
this
is
not
even
to
mention
the
wonderful
nights
that
I
have
spent
on
Central
Campus
,
sitting
with
an
apartment
full
of
friends
,
talking
,
laughing
,
and
playing
What
Do
You
Meme
well
into
the
night
.
While
I
do
recognize
the
importance
of
alone
time
,
there
is
something
even
more
profound
to
be
said
for
a
constant
pool
of
people
whether
they’re
close
friends
or
simply
acquaintances
who
can
relate
to
,
engage
with
,
and
support
you
at
any
hour
of
the
day
.
In
the
second
and
last
semester
of
my
life
on
Central
Campus
,
I
feel
truly
sad
for
the
first
years
who
will
never
have
the
opportunity
to
experience
the
community
that
I
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
live
in
this
year
.
So
,
thank
you
,
Central
Campus
,
for
giving
me
a
home
,
catalyzing
meaningful
relationships
with
other
members
of
the
Duke
community
,
and
enabling
me
to
live
in
a
place
that
I
am
genuinely
excited
to
return
to
every
night
.
I
walked
into
the
kitchen
in
my
dorm
,
and
I
smelled
the
glorious
aroma
of
noodles
being
cooked
on
the
stove
.
I
was
starving
and
wanted
to
eat
all
of
the
ramen
.
A
group
of
freshmen
and
sophomores
informed
me
that
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
spicy
ramen
challenge
.
They
were
sweating
and
the
plates
and
bowls
in
front
of
them
were
dark
red
.
Nonetheless
,
I
was
not
dissuaded
.
My
friends
finished
boiling
the
noodles
and
then
cooked
them
in
a
light
red
,
thin
,
soup
like
mixture
.
I
scooped
some
noodles
and
practically
inhaled
them
,
and
only
suffered
a
runny
nose
.
Everyone
seemed
impressed
at
my
lack
of
reaction
,
and
someone
joked
that
the
only
white
person
in
the
room
was
handling
things
much
better
than
expected
.
As
I
waited
for
nbsp
;
the
final
round
,
my
chef
friends
asked
the
group
if
we
wanted
the
noodles
to
be
extra
spicy
.
We
all
said
yes
.
I
spied
an
entire
shaker
of
pepper
flakes
being
put
into
the
ramen
,
and
when
it
was
done
cooking
in
the
sauce
,
the
ramen
was
a
deep
and
dark
red
,
like
the
color
of
dried
blood
.
Since
I
hadn’t
had
much
trouble
and
made
fun
of
all
of
the
negative
reactions
to
the
mildly
spicy
noodles
,
I
took
the
noodles
at
the
bottom
of
the
pot
,
which
were
the
darkest
and
had
the
most
sauce
.
We
could
all
tell
that
these
noodles
were
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
,
and
a
gigantic
helping
remained
at
the
bottom
of
the
pot
after
we
all
took
some
.
Someone
asked
if
anyone
wanted
a
bit
more
.
I
said
yes
,
and
one
of
my
friends
scraped
the
entire
rest
of
the
noodles
onto
my
plate
.
I
had
twice
as
many
noodles
as
everyone
else
,
but
I
wasn’t
that
worried
.
After
all
,
the
second
round
wasn’t
too
bad
.
I
had
done
it
before
.
Mere
seconds
after
we
all
dug
in
to
our
plates
,
we
all
realized
why
these
noodles
had
been
deemed
The
World’s
Spiciest
Instant
Ramen
.
They
were
ridiculously
hot
,
and
immediately
my
mouth
was
on
fire
.
My
cheeks
were
tingling
.
My
stomach
started
rumbling
.
And
to
make
matters
worse
,
the
sauce
was
extremely
thick
and
oily
it
stuck
to
my
tongue
,
it
stained
my
lips
,
and
it
made
me
realize
how
seriously
I
underestimated
these
noodles
.
A
few
people
finished
their
plates
,
and
took
turns
chugging
the
jug
of
chocolate
milk
as
if
they
were
drinking
from
the
fountain
of
youth
.
I
still
had
a
mountain
of
noodles
piled
on
my
plate
,
and
my
eyes
started
to
tear
up
whether
in
anticipation
of
the
fight
to
come
or
because
the
sauce
was
starting
to
aerosolize
into
the
air
,
I’m
not
quite
sure
.
Part
of
the
challenge
was
no
water
or
chocolate
milk
until
we
finished
the
third
plate
of
noodles
,
and
I
was
determined
to
get
relief
from
the
burning
that
was
spreading
throughout
my
entire
body
.
After
most
people
had
either
finished
their
noodles
or
had
given
up
entirely
and
thrown
in
the
chocolate
milk
colored
flag
,
I
sat
at
the
table
,
determined
to
finish
this
steaming
plate
of
noodles
.
I
devoured
the
huge
plate
of
noodles
in
about
two
minutes
,
downed
a
few
mouthfuls
of
chocolate
milk
,
and
ran
to
the
bathroom
to
try
to
spit
out
the
remainder
of
the
hot
sauce
in
my
mouth
.
My
senses
had
never
been
so
overwhelmed
;
it’s
difficult
to
describe
how
powerful
that
ramen
really
was
.
As
my
gastrointestinal
system
has
struggled
to
recover
from
this
crime
against
my
own
body
,
I’ve
been
participating
in
recruitment
or
rush
events
for
my
SLG
,
frantically
finishing
homework
and
readings
,
emailing
professors
,
spending
time
in
a
tent
,
and
trying
to
figure
out
why
I’ve
had
sinus
infection
symptoms
for
more
than
five
weeks
.
It’s
been
hard
to
juggle
it
all
and
I
have
to
say
I’m
doing
worse
than
I
normally
do
in
staying
on
top
of
my
commitments
.
Like
many
Duke
students
,
I
have
been
too
stubborn
to
put
reasonable
limits
on
the
things
I
do
.
As
much
as
we
joke
about
always
being
busy
,
it’s
part
of
the
culture
here
to
try
to
fill
up
our
time
with
a
billion
activities
and
to
always
have
a
full
schedule
,
while
at
the
same
time
expecting
each
other
to
have
time
for
spontaneous
activities
.
I’m
guilty
of
saying
yes
a
little
too
easily
and
am
constantly
overbooked
.
And
despite
always
having
too
much
to
do
,
I
try
not
to
miss
many
opportunities
for
unique
and
memorable
experiences
with
my
friends
.
It
certainly
isn’t
the
healthiest
way
to
go
about
things
,
but
at
the
same
time
there
is
so
much
to
take
part
in
here
at
Duke
that
I
feel
guilty
if
I
don’t
take
advantage
of
all
that
I
can
.
There
are
many
people
that
preach
that
the
most
powerful
word
to
take
control
of
your
time
is
no
,
and
that
people
should
guard
their
time
very
carefully
so
as
to
preserve
their
priorities
.
But
as
I
reflect
on
the
ways
that
I
spend
my
time
at
Duke
and
the
things
that
I
do
,
I
don’t
regret
much
.
Instead
,
I
find
myself
growing
more
and
more
attracted
to
the
idea
that
being
busy
is
good
at
least
as
long
as
I
am
doing
things
that
I
enjoy
.
But
every
once
in
awhile
,
I
think
it’s
healthy
and
not
just
for
my
stomach
to
be
reminded
to
not
bite
off
more
than
I
can
chew
.
Or
not
to
get
lost
in
the
sauce
.
Students
in
Brown
residence
hall
on
East
Campus
found
an
injured
fox
at
the
underpass
near
Smith
Warehouse
and
brought
it
back
to
the
dormitory
.
The
fox
was
later
tested
for
rabies
.
There
are
several
topics
of
conversation
that
accompany
the
start
of
spring
semester
tell
me
more
about
abroad
,
juniors
,
but
perhaps
the
biggest
is
the
recruitment
process
for
the
Interfraternity
Council
,
Panhellenic
Association
,
and
Selective
Living
Groups
that
takes
place
every
January
.
In
my
years
at
Duke
,
I
have
seen
just
how
valuable
membership
to
a
Greek
organization
or
SLG
can
be
.
They
provide
built
in
community
.
They
facilitate
mentor
mentee
relationships
between
older
and
younger
undergraduates
and
they
provide
opportunities
to
meet
people
on
campus
you
might
never
have
met
otherwise
.
But
these
groups
are
selective
,
which
means
not
everyone
can
get
in
.
And
the
reality
of
this
type
of
rejection
is
too
often
swept
under
the
rug
.
Three
years
ago
,
I
made
my
way
through
the
rush
process
for
a
few
of
the
non
Greek
SLGs
on
campus
.
I
went
into
rush
looking
for
a
fun
new
community
on
campus
and
an
opportunity
to
duplicate
the
tight
knit
residential
experience
I
so
valued
in
my
first
year
dorm
.
Plus
,
almost
all
of
the
friends
I
had
made
in
my
first
semester
were
rushing
some
form
of
social
organization
.
I
had
heard
rumors
that
hallways
in
East
Campus
dorms
became
empty
after
rush
,
and
when
that
happened
,
I
didn’t
want
to
be
left
behind
.
So
I
rushed
.
I
went
to
open
houses
,
played
dodgeball
at
Sky
Zone
,
and
skated
around
Wheels
.
I
stood
in
common
rooms
and
tried
to
be
memorable
in
conversations
where
rushees
outnumbered
SLG
members
10
to
one
.
I
grew
to
love
the
SLGs
I
was
rushing
,
and
I
was
excited
about
the
budding
friendships
that
I
seemed
to
be
forming
.
But
when
bid
day
came
,
many
of
my
friends
received
bids
.
I
was
rejected
.
In
a
recruitment
process
for
social
groups
,
rejection
is
indisputably
personal
.
When
you
apply
to
Duke
,
you
are
evaluated
on
your
academic
and
extracurricular
merits
.
When
you
try
out
for
a
sports
team
,
you
are
evaluated
on
your
ability
to
play
the
sport
.
But
when
you
rush
a
social
group
,
you
are
evaluated
on
your
personality
.
You
can
call
it
vibes
or
fit
with
the
group
if
it
makes
you
feel
better
,
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
there
are
no
clear
qualifications
for
getting
into
a
social
SLG
or
a
Greek
organization
other
than
how
much
the
people
in
the
group
like
you
.
So
when
friends
of
mine
got
bids
to
the
SLGs
that
rejected
me
,
I
internalized
the
notion
that
I
had
a
worse
personality
or
at
least
,
the
groups
I
had
wanted
to
be
a
part
of
liked
my
friends
better
than
they
liked
me
.
And
though
you
could
argue
that
it’s
not
that
black
and
white
and
that
First
Year
Ethan
should
have
just
gotten
over
himself
,
I
wasn’t
the
only
one
who
left
my
first
year
January
with
a
sour
taste
in
my
mouth
.
I
remember
how
toxic
it
felt
as
the
girls
in
my
dorm
who
were
rushing
Panhellenic
sororities
wondered
why
they
had
been
cut
from
their
favorite
chapter
,
or
why
their
friend
got
invited
back
to
a
chapter
when
they
didn’t
,
or
what
they
could
have
done
differently
to
get
the
bid
they
wanted
.
And
for
the
rest
of
the
semester
,
the
names
of
SLGs
and
Greek
chapters
were
plastered
on
dorm
room
doors
,
so
when
you
walked
to
the
shower
,
you
were
reminded
of
who
was
accepted
where
,
and
who
didn’t
get
in
at
all
.
Now
that
I
am
three
years
removed
,
I
can
see
how
inconsequential
my
rejection
was
for
my
social
experience
at
Duke
.
Whether
you
don’t
get
the
bid
you
want
or
you
don’t
rush
at
all
,
being
unaffiliated
does
not
need
to
limit
your
social
life
or
place
sanctions
on
which
friends
you
can
make
,
or
keep
.
But
I
also
got
lucky
.
The
friends
I
made
in
Brown
Residence
Hall
,
most
of
whom
are
affiliated
,
are
still
some
of
my
closest
at
Duke
.
I
had
joined
a
dance
group
during
my
first
year
fall
,
and
it
has
provided
me
with
a
family
away
from
home
for
the
entirety
of
my
Duke
experience
.
Few
people
at
Duke
can
say
that
their
strongest
long
term
relationships
were
formed
during
their
first
few
months
on
campus
.
And
even
if
getting
into
clubs
like
my
dance
group
is
based
on
some
other
type
of
merit
,
they
are
still
social
organizations
,
and
they
are
still
selective
.
In
too
many
cases
,
finding
an
organized
community
on
this
campus
comes
at
the
expense
of
that
community
being
available
to
others
.
This
isn’t
supposed
to
be
about
self
pity
,
and
I’m
not
suggesting
that
we
would
be
better
off
if
we
got
rid
of
all
selective
social
organizations
on
campus
.
I
know
many
Duke
students
struggled
in
their
first
semester
,
rushed
in
January
,
and
found
a
support
system
in
their
SLG
or
Greek
chapter
that
changed
the
trajectory
of
their
college
experience
,
and
I
would
never
want
to
deny
them
that
.
But
finding
your
social
niche
at
Duke
shouldn’t
be
a
zero
sum
game
.
So
while
there
is
much
more
to
the
Duke
social
experience
than
rush
and
selective
living
,
we
as
a
campus
would
do
well
to
find
a
way
to
provide
this
kind
of
community
to
everyone
who
seeks
it
.
Last
April
,
I
remember
ripping
open
letters
and
packages
from
universities
with
unmistakable
excitement
.
In
spite
of
the
dazzling
displays
of
pomp
and
propaganda
,
a
realization
quickly
struck
me
college
comes
with
a
cost
,
literally
.
To
make
my
Duke
dreams
a
reality
,
I
set
out
last
spring
to
apply
for
as
many
outside
scholarships
as
I
could
.
Incidentally
,
the
monies
of
just
one
award
surpassed
both
the
offered
loans
and
work
study
.
So
,
where
did
the
excess
money
go
?
In
short
,
it
replaced
a
part
of
my
financial
aid
package
because
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
University
,
my
need
or
financial
aid
was
reduced
.
Discourse
on
financial
aid
has
dominated
headlines
this
year
.
From
questions
of
university
healthcare
coverage
to
the
unexpected
consequences
of
taking
out
hefty
loans
,
students
have
largely
been
steering
this
dialogue
.
However
,
one
issue
that
hasn’t
gotten
the
same
intense
scrutiny
thrust
upon
it
is
Scholarship
Award
Displacement
.
Implementation
of
this
policy
differs
by
university
.
Essentially
,
scholarship
displacement
is
an
institution’s
redistributive
power
over
student
scholarship
monies
.
It’s
important
to
note
that
outside
scholarships
that
are
sent
directly
to
the
student
or
through
529
plan
don’t
face
this
obstacle
.
And
students
can’t
control
whether
their
earnings
are
sent
straight
to
the
university
or
not
.
Many
universities
,
including
Duke
,
allow
for
students
to
use
their
earnings
to
eliminate
loans
and
federal
work
study
offerings
.
But
invariably
under
this
policy
,
students
on
financial
aid
are
barred
from
using
outside
scholarships
to
reduce
their
yearly
cost
of
attendance
.
The
argument
for
scholarship
award
displacement
holds
that
the
financial
aid
office
redistributes
an
ever
shifting
lump
sum
of
money
in
order
to
maximize
financial
support
for
those
who
demonstrate
the
institution’s
definition
of
need
.
When
a
student’s
outside
scholarship
s
exceeds
that
of
the
loan
work
study
offerings
,
the
process
decreases
financial
aid
,
thus
freeing
up
money
for
other
students
.
With
potentially
vital
financial
support
at
stake
for
other
students
,
I
understand
the
moral
arguments
wrapped
up
in
the
allocation
process
.
One
person’s
scholarship
displacement
also
known
as
over
award
could
mean
all
the
difference
for
another
student
on
need
based
aid
.
It’s
a
strange
oscillation
between
the
two
sides
of
the
displacement
debate
,
which
boils
down
to
a
matter
of
individualism
vs
.
collectivism
.
The
primary
goal
of
pursuing
outside
scholarships
is
to
make
the
exorbitant
price
tag
of
college
more
affordable
on
an
individual
level
,
whereas
the
goal
of
the
financial
aid
budget
is
to
fairly
portion
out
funds
so
that
all
admitted
students
can
attend
the
university
.
Understandably
,
when
raising
these
issues
directly
with
the
Financial
Aid
Office
itself
,
the
response
is
the
same
Duke
has
a
policy
.
Although
the
premise
of
displacement
is
meant
to
ensure
the
greatest
amount
of
funds
available
for
students
on
need
based
aid
,
I
do
believe
that
there
could
be
more
room
for
negotiation
,
particularly
with
expenses
not
included
in
the
Expected
Family
Contribution
EFC
.
In
assessing
a
student’s
financial
aid
package
,
the
Financial
Aid
Office
considers
the
total
costs
they
think
a
student
may
incur
billed
and
unbilled
.
However
,
that
does
not
justify
completely
undercutting
students’
efforts
to
use
their
outside
aid
,
such
as
paying
for
books
.
The
total
cost
of
attendance
approximates
roughly
1
,
200
for
the
cost
of
books
supplies
not
pocket
change
by
any
means
.
But
under
the
current
policy
,
students
are
not
incentivized
to
seek
outside
aid
because
it
may
only
lead
to
a
reduction
of
a
grant
after
loans
and
federal
work
study
are
dissolved
.
And
for
scholarships
that
explicitly
stipulate
they
can
be
used
for
textbooks
course
costs
,
students
who
would
have
otherwise
made
Duke
related
purchases
textbooks
,
books
,
software
,
and
supplies
through
the
Duke
Store
cannot
access
these
earned
scholarship
monies
.
Students
then
must
pay
,
in
addition
to
their
EFC
,
a
variety
of
course
related
fees
.
Scholarship
displacement
can
lead
to
unintended
collateral
damage
towards
student
outcomes
.
I’ve
heard
stories
of
students
unable
to
afford
the
expensive
costs
of
their
class
materials
,
resorting
to
taking
pictures
of
entire
textbooks
on
their
phones
,
or
even
worse
,
not
being
able
to
use
assigned
course
materials
altogether
.
According
to
a
statement
by
President
Price
,
The
broader
challenge
to
university
finances
has
not
gone
away
.
Indeed
,
tuition
has
inflated
to
the
extent
that
without
a
hefty
financial
aid
budget
,
private
universities
would
be
virtually
inaccessible
to
students
from
diverse
socioeconomic
backgrounds
.
With
this
perennial
rise
in
cost
,
it
makes
sense
that
students
are
increasingly
seeking
outside
assistance
to
help
finance
their
education
.
This
begs
a
broader
question
of
the
accessibility
of
higher
education
and
the
role
that
money
plays
in
distorting
university
priorities
.
The
burden
of
responsibility
should
not
be
forced
upon
financially
dependent
students
to
finance
what
is
essentially
a
monetary
backwash
for
Duke’s
aid
packages
.
Because
if
Duke
truly
cared
about
meeting
100
percent
of
demonstrated
need
,
then
Duke
wouldn’t
to
leverage
its
multi
billion
dollar
endowment’s
stringent
terms
of
use
over
students
.

Now
,
I
don’t
pretend
to
understand
the
minutiae
of
allocating
aid
packages
.
It’s
a
mysterious
black
box
to
me
.
But
I
recognize
that
the
innate
complexities
connected
to
financial
aid
aren’t
exclusive
to
Duke
.
Scholarship
award
displacement
plagues
students
at
public
and
private
universities
alike
except
for
Maryland
public
colleges
,
which
outlawed
the
practice
in
2017
.
The
fact
of
these
policies’
universality
doesn’t
mean
that
we
shouldn’t
challenge
or
question
the
status
quo
.
I
don’t
anticipate
policies
to
change
overnight
or
expect
Duke
to
budge
on
the
issue
of
reducing
EFC
anytime
soon
.
Still
,
I
hope
for
greater
transparency
,
openness
and
a
willingness
to
discuss
the
issues
on
the
table
between
students
and
administration
.
But
for
now
,
all
I’m
asking
Duke
is
Where
did
my
scholarship
go
?
I
would
like
to
make
a
clarification
and
an
apology
concerning
a
recent
Chronicle
article
on
recording
thousands
of
students'
faces
.
I
have
never
worked
on
facial
recognition
.
We
recorded
the
data
to
research
methods
to
analyze
the
motion
of
objects
in
video
,
whether
they
are
people
,
cars
,
fish
or
other
.
My
students
and
I
have
also
done
research
on
diagnosing
retinopathy
of
prematurity
in
infants
,
lower
the
cost
of
screening
for
colorectal
cancer
,
determine
the
provenance
of
documents
on
Golden
Age
Spanish
theater
from
handwriting
analysis
,
track
hand
motion
to
interpret
American
Sign
Language
and
much
more
.
We
were
and
are
uninterested
in
determining
personal
identity
from
images
.
The
closest
we
came
to
a
project
that
involves
personal
identity
was
a
method
for
protecting
sensitive
personal
information
from
the
prying
eyes
of
surveillance
cameras
.
I
will
explain
in
a
separate
guest
column
what
we
do
do
in
our
work
on
motion
analysis
in
video
.
I
genuinely
thought
I
was
following
IRB
Institutional
Review
Board
guidelines
in
our
project
on
video
analysis
.
As
directed
,
we
placed
posters
at
all
entrance
points
to
the
recording
area
.
The
posters
described
our
research
and
its
goals
,
and
gave
people
contact
information
email
,
phone
they
could
use
to
request
for
any
data
to
be
erased
.
Nobody
did
.
However
,
it
turns
out
that
I
deviated
from
IRB
guidance
in
two
aspects
Recording
outdoors
rather
than
indoors
,
and
making
the
data
available
without
protections
.
IRB
is
not
to
be
blamed
,
as
I
failed
to
consult
them
at
critical
junctures
.
I
take
full
responsibility
for
my
mistakes
,
and
I
apologize
to
all
people
who
were
recorded
and
to
Duke
for
their
consequences
.
A
capacity
crowd
of
9
,
314
,
including
the
ever
present
Crazies
,
pack
into
Cameron
for
every
game
nowadays
as
Duke
maintains
its
sellout
streak
.

If
I
were
the
president
I
would
be
giving
3
million
to
starving
children
.
I
would
also
end
the
war
in
Iraq
.
I
would
try
to
make
everyone
happy
.
This
is
the
full
text
of
a
journal
entry
entitled
If
I
Were
the
President
that
I
wrote
when
I
was
eight
years
old
.
While
I
was
home
for
a
few
weeks
after
this
past
semester
,
my
mom
pulled
out
my
old
schoolwork
,
all
of
the
notebooks
and
assignments
she
held
onto
over
the
course
of
my
childhood
and
early
adult
life
.
I
read
through
the
composition
books
,
occasionally
impressed
with
my
writing
skills
I
used
a
semicolon
correctly
in
third
grade
!
or
amused
at
my
rhetorical
choices
.
Da
,
da
,
da
,
da’s
aside
,
what
interested
me
most
about
my
childhood
writing
was
my
unabashed
creativity
,
my
unfiltered
belief
in
easy
solutions
.
In
my
journal
,
I
could
save
all
the
starving
children
with
3
million
a
small
sum
relative
to
the
gravity
of
childhood
hunger
.
In
my
journal
,
I
could
end
the
war
in
Iraq
make
everyone
happy
perhaps
an
oxymoron
.
I
wrote
a
story
called
Magical
Sled
Adventure
in
which
I
met
Santa
,
who
inexplicably
carried
golden
menorahs
in
his
sled
.
I
wrote
about
turning
into
a
polka
dotted
sheep
,
who
was
still
a
fantastic
swimmer
.
I
used
onomatopoeia
which
I
could
spell
better
then
than
now
accenting
my
stories
with
upper
case
exclamations
like
BANG
!
and
CLANG
!
Somewhere
along
the
way
,
I
lost
some
of
that
creativity
.
I
tampered
some
of
that
childhood
idealism
and
naivety
.
I
no
longer
imagine
ending
food
insecurity
with
3
million
.
I
don’t
even
imagine
being
president
.
Usually
,
this
is
the
part
of
the
column
where
I
lament
that
loss
of
imagination
and
optimism
.
I
could
go
on
a
tirade
against
our
education
system
,
which
sucks
away
our
sense
of
self
.
I
could
rail
against
the
University
for
prioritizing
standardized
test
scores
over
creativity
and
stifling
individual
voices
.
But
actually
,
I’m
not
going
to
do
any
of
that
.
In
fact
,
in
some
ways
,
I
am
glad
for
my
tinged
imagination
.
What
I
have
lost
in
ability
to
dream
up
polka
dotted
sheep
or
magical
sleds
I
have
gained
in
ability
to
synthesize
vast
swaths
of
information
,
analyze
it
clearly
and
explicitly
,
and
present
it
in
a
public
manner
.
What
I
have
lost
in
self
assuredness
,
I
have
gained
in
humility
,
in
thoroughness
.
Duke
has
enough
self
absorption
it
needs
humble
,
careful
analysis
.
My
Duke
career
and
I
suspect
most
people’s
Duke
careers
has
been
full
of
getting
lost
in
minutia
,
of
over
valuing
my
own
ideas
,
of
reading
three
articles
about
a
topic
and
assuming
I’m
the
world’s
leading
expert
in
it
.
In
these
moments
,
I
am
reminded
of
the
third
grader
who
assumed
she
could
solve
world
hunger
.
I
sometimes
get
so
deep
into
a
problem
,
so
far
down
into
an
academic
hole
,
that
I
forget
the
people
I’m
writing
about
and
I
neglect
to
speak
in
regular
words
.
I
think
many
Duke
students
are
guilty
of
this
third
grade
trap
missing
the
forest
through
the
trees
because
we
think
we’re
the
best
cartographers
.
Imagination
,
creativity
and
idealism
are
important
essential
,
even
.
They
play
a
valuable
role
in
the
editorial
section
.
But
the
editorial
section
is
not
a
diary
,
not
like
my
third
grade
notebooks
.
It
should
not
exist
to
publish
sweeping
claims
or
unfounded
ideas
.
It
should
not
exist
to
talk
about
the
weather
or
existential
crises
or
even
to
wax
poetic
about
student
journalism
like
I’m
doing
now
.
The
editorial
section
,
above
all
,
is
a
platform
in
which
to
comment
on
the
news
of
the
day
.
It
is
a
platform
for
straightforward
,
persuasive
rhetoric
on
relevant
issues
that
impact
real
people
.
It
is
the
pulse
of
campus
conversation
,
the
first
place
to
gauge
student
opinions
on
all
things
Duke
.
Many
of
you
will
be
starting
your
first
semester
at
Duke
this
fall
.
I
write
on
the
verge
of
my
seventh
.
I
won’t
pretend
to
have
much
advice
on
succeeding
in
class
or
balancing
your
time
well
,
but
after
six
semesters
,
I
know
a
lot
about
the
Chronicle
editorial
section
.
Whether
you’re
interested
in
writing
as
a
columnist
,
becoming
an
editor
or
just
submitting
a
letter
to
the
editor
once
in
a
while
,
I
hope
that
you
will
be
not
just
creative
and
ambitious
in
your
writing
,
but
relevant
,
honest
and
straightforward
.
I
hope
that
you
will
better
our
political
commentary
by
backing
up
your
claims
,
interviewing
relevant
sources
and
using
clear
,
concise
language
.
I
hope
that
you
will
advance
our
social
commentary
through
honest
reflection
tied
to
ongoing
campus
events
and
news
.
I
hope
that
the
editorial
section
will
be
your
space
to
share
thorough
and
well
researched
opinions
,
rather
than
diary
entries
.
Regardless
of
whether
or
not
you
have
an
interest
in
writing
,
I
think
this
is
useful
advice
for
college
.
Our
thoughts
are
worth
little
if
they
are
uninterpretable
and
vague
,
detached
or
unresearched
like
my
ideas
for
presidency
.
Ask
any
Duke
student
,
and
they
will
likely
empathize
with
the
experience
of
coming
home
from
a
long
semester
of
school
,
only
to
be
asked
what
they
studied
or
what
they’re
doing
this
summer
and
be
left
speechless
.
College
lets
you
get
so
deep
into
the
weeds
that
you
forget
how
to
tell
your
grandma
what
you’re
working
on
.
And
whether
you’re
writing
a
column
or
just
at
the
dinner
table
,
that
simple
communication
is
the
most
important
of
all
.

You
won’t
find
many
stories
about
magical
sled
adventures
and
you
won’t
find
a
thorough
account
of
my
Summer
Vacation
Plans
but
if
you’re
lucky
,
you’ll
find
something
worth
reading
.
I
always
tell
people
that
my
first
concert
was
The
All
American
Rejects
when
I
was
fourteen
,
at
Higher
Ground
in
South
Burlington
,
Vermont
.
nbsp
;
That
was
a
great
show
,
but
in
truth
my
first
concert
was
a
different
performance
at
the
same
venue
a
few
years
prior
.
My
dad
took
my
older
sister
and
I
to
see
Anaïs
Mitchell’s
Hadestown
,
a
gritty
,
still
developing
,
folk
opera
concept
album
that
retold
the
myth
of
Orpheus
and
Eurydice
in
a
setting
somewhere
between
post
apocalyptic
steampunk
and
Great
Depression
era
New
Orleans
.
For
years
,
it
has
been
far
easier
to
skip
over
Hadestown
and
tell
people
that
my
first
concert
was
The
All
American
Rejects
instead
of
having
to
list
this
jumble
of
quirky
descriptors
.
nbsp
;
But
since
2007
,
this
unconventional
project
has
evolved
into
an
extraordinary
Broadway
musical
that
just
won
eight
of
the
fourteen
Tony
Awards
it
was
nominated
for
,
including
Best
New
Musical
.
nbsp
;
For
the
first
time
,
if
I
were
to
mention
Anaïs
Mitchell
,
someone
might
actually
know
who
I
was
talking
about
.
I
was
only
ten
or
eleven
when
I
saw
Hadestown
,
and
remember
the
night
as
a
series
of
vignettes
against
a
hazy
background
.
nbsp
;
I
remember
clearly
the
excitement
and
freedom
of
being
out
with
my
dad
,
free
from
younger
sisters
at
a
real
,
grown
up
concert
.
nbsp
;
He
gave
me
a
twenty
at
intermission
and
I
bought
a
root
beer
and
Mitchell’s
Hadestown
CD
,
which
we
listened
to
in
the
car
ride
home
.
nbsp
;
I
felt
so
adult
to
be
able
to
walk
up
to
the
bar
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
room
and
order
a
drink
,
even
if
it
was
just
a
soda
.
nbsp
;
I
remember
the
bizarre
costumes
the
performers
wore
lots
of
gas
masks
and
utility
belts
;
the
stage
lights
making
Mitchell’s
hair
glow
copper
;
the
unusual
,
sweet
quality
of
her
voice
.
But
most
of
all
,
I
remember
the
story
.
nbsp
;
This
show
caught
me
when
I
was
in
the
middle
of
a
deep
classical
mythology
phase
that
I
perhaps
never
fully
grew
out
of
.
nbsp
;
I
was
that
weird
kid
who
absolutely
devoured
the
in
tenth
grade
;
the
girl
who
added
Latin
as
a
second
foreign
language
;
the
girl
who
is
now
writing
a
senior
thesis
in
the
Classics
Department
at
Duke
.
And
when
I
saw
Hadestown
in
fifth
grade
,
I
was
enthralled
by
the
idea
that
an
ancient
myth
like
the
story
of
Orpheus
and
Eurydice
could
be
retold
and
recalled
to
relevancy
in
a
medium
as
dynamic
and
unexpected
as
this
production
.
I
have
not
been
fortunate
enough
to
see
Hadestown
on
Broadway
,
and
from
what
I’ve
read
,
it
seems
like
the
show
has
developed
substantially
in
the
ten
plus
years
since
I
saw
it
in
Vermont
.
nbsp
;
But
listening
to
the
,
I’ve
found
that
the
same
songs
I
listened
to
on
CD
,
then
on
my
iPod
Nano
,
appear
in
an
entirely
new
light
just
a
decade
later
,
although
most
of
the
lyrics
are
unchanged
.
The
words
of
Eurydice’s
heartbreaking
lament
,
Flowers
,
echo
differently
in
the
post
MeToo
world
Dreams
are
sweet
until
they’re
not
Men
are
kind
until
they
aren’t
Flowers
bloom
until
they
rot
and
fall
apart
Is
anybody
listening
?
nbsp
;
Hearing
this
song
,
I
cannot
help
but
think
of
the
women
I
know
who
have
been
sexually
assaulted
,
the
physical
and
emotional
pain
suffered
by
them
and
so
many
others
,
and
the
names
of
actors
,
producers
,
CEOs
,
senators
,
and
Supreme
Court
Justices
who
have
inflicted
that
pain
.
nbsp
;
It
wounds
me
to
consider
how
many
people
could
also
sing
Eurydice’s
words
.
And
had
I
not
personally
heard
it
performed
back
then
,
I
would
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
Mitchell
wrote
the
song
Why
We
Build
the
Wall
over
a
decade
ago
.
nbsp
;
Hades’
philosophy
of
separation
resonates
profoundly
in
a
country
where
thousands
of
people
were
recently
unemployed
for
weeks
because
of
an
argument
over
a
wall
.
nbsp
;
With
a
president
who
ran
his
campaign
on
promises
to
construct
a
wall
between
the
United
States
and
Mexico
and
to
stop
immigration
from
majority
Muslim
countries
in
the
interest
of
national
security
,
the
words
of
the
charismatic
,
totalitarian
Lord
of
the
Underworld
resound
differently
in
my
ears
The
enemy
is
poverty
And
the
wall
keeps
out
the
enemy
And
we
build
the
wall
to
keep
us
free
That’s
why
we
build
the
wall
.
nbsp
;
In
this
particular
time
and
place
,
the
songs
of
Hades
and
Eurydice
strike
an
eerily
parallel
note
.
These
topical
lyrics
combine
with
a
blend
of
musical
styles
,
a
female
led
creative
team
,
and
a
diverse
cast
to
coax
this
ancient
myth
into
2019
.
nbsp
;
The
musical
concludes
with
the
narrator
,
Hermes
,
beginning
to
recount
the
same
story
once
more
.
nbsp
;
Wistful
,
he
explains
that
even
though
we’ve
heard
this
tale
before
,
and
already
know
how
it
ends
,
we
keep
telling
and
retelling
it
,
always
hoping
that
it
might
have
a
happier
ending
this
time
.
nbsp
;
Through
his
songs
,
Orpheus
could
make
you
see
how
the
world
could
be
In
spite
of
the
way
it
is
.
nbsp
;
The
music
and
story
have
a
power
of
their
own
,
a
magic
that
enchants
and
creates
and
has
intrigued
me
since
my
ten
year
old
,
obsessed
self
first
encountered
Hadestown
.
nbsp
;
From
that
night
,
I
recall
the
fiery
stage
lights
illuminating
otherworldly
costumes
and
characters
;
the
sweet
fizz
of
root
beer
in
a
plastic
cup
;
and
the
old
story
that
I
find
even
more
compelling
as
an
adult
than
as
a
child
.
Today
,
women
are
continually
stripped
of
their
bodily
autonomy
;
walls
regularly
tear
families
apart
;
people
are
relentlessly
oppressed
by
the
systems
that
profess
to
lift
them
up
.
nbsp
;
But
in
the
telling
and
retelling
of
stories
like
Hadestown
,
maybe
we
,
like
Orpheus
,
can
see
how
the
world
could
be
,
in
spite
of
the
way
it
is
.
I
remember
my
first
interview
as
a
reporter
for
The
Chronicle
like
it
was
yesterday
.
For
months
,
as
I
applied
to
different
colleges
and
scholarship
programs
,
I
sat
on
one
end
of
the
table
,
answering
questions
for
interview
after
interview
.
Now
the
tables
had
turned
,
and
I
was
the
one
asking
the
questions
to
a
professor
who
had
just
written
a
book
on
America
in
the
age
of
Trump
.
I
stammered
through
my
questions
and
breathed
a
huge
sigh
of
relief
when
I
was
finished
.
Flash
forward
to
this
past
May
,
and
I’m
interviewing
none
other
than
President
Vincent
Price
with
the
ease
of
a
seasoned
journalist
or
so
I’d
like
to
think
.
Journalists
,
and
journalism
more
broadly
,
for
that
matter
,
aren’t
perfect
.
It’s
really
difficult
to
get
the
whole
picture
,
the
complete
story
.
It’s
easy
to
mess
up
somebody’s
name
,
forget
a
detail
,
miss
the
forest
for
the
trees
.
Student
journalism
is
even
messier
.
With
constant
turnover
,
important
and
complicated
stories
are
written
by
students
learning
to
be
reporters
and
just
like
that
,
those
new
reporters
become
editors
,
and
then
maybe
they
become
Editor
in
Chief
with
two
years
of
journalism
under
their
belt
yours_truly
.
But
that’s
why
student
journalism
is
so
important
,
especially
here
at
Duke
.
It’s
clean
and
simple
to
put
out
public
relations
materials
,
and
trust
me
,
this
university
is
overflowing
with
it
.
It’s
more
difficult
to
do
real
reporting
,
but
it’s
so
necessary
.
In
case
you
haven’t
followed
,
there’s
a
lot
of
dirt
that
Duke
just
doesn’t
want
to
be
dug
up
.
That’s
where
The
Chronicle
comes
in
.
Just
this
past
year
,
we’ve
looked
into
some
shady
investments
Duke
made
and
the
reaction
to
housekeepers
being
made
to
work
weekends
.
We
asked
who
really
killed
Durham’s
light
rail
,
and
after
the
news
that
a
professor
warned
Chinese
students
not
to
speak
Chinese
became
a
national
scandal
,
we
broke
the
news
that
she
had
done
the
same
thing
months
before
.
Why
can
we
do
this
?
Because
we
are
independent
of
the
University
,
and
we
don’t
have
an
agenda
.
If
Duke
does
something
praiseworthy
,
we’ll
report
it
.
In
fact
,
The
Chronicle
loves
publishing
feel
good
articles
,
whether
it's
about
Duke’s
sports
teams
,
an
incredible
student
story
or
groundbreaking
research
.
We
want
to
paint
as
complete
a
picture
as
we
can
of
the
University
while
giving
people
the
truth
not
just
what
they
want
to
hear
.
Don’t
worry
though
we
aren’t
normally
this
self
serious
.
We
rate
avocados
and
profile
the
dankest
food
truck
in
Durham
.
In
our
cozy
office
in
301
Flowers
,
we
watch
basketball
games
,
make
CookOut
runs
and
host
Chronicle
formals
.
I
can’t
tell
you
how
many
thought
provoking
conversations
I’ve
had
up
in
the
office
.
And
to
relax
our
minds
,
a
group
of
us
even
went
to
Beach
Week
together
this
year
.
I
joined
The
Chronicle
to
be
a
better
writer
.
I
stayed
because
of
the
family
I’ve
found
here
.
There
are
many
ways
to
get
involved
with
The
Chronicle
,
and
for
all
the
departments
except
the
opinion
section
,
no
application
is
required
.
You
just
have
to
show
up
to
a
meeting
and
bring
a
good
attitude
.
In
the
news
department
,
you
can
become
plugged
in
to
Duke
and
get
a
feel
for
how
this
university
really
operates
.
Reporters
write
about
the
news
of
the
day
and
answer
questions
that
come
straight
from
our
readers
.
In
just
two
years
here
,
I’ve
investigated
unfair
changes
to
housekeeping
hours
,
watched
Bernie
Sanders
speak
at
the
Chapel
,
witnessed
a
Silent
Sam
protest
at
UNC
Chapel
Hill
and
written
a
deep
dive
piece
on
how
many
avocados
Duke
vendors
use
we’re
student
journalists
aren’t
we
allowed
to
have
a
little
fun
?
.
If
you’ve
ever
dreamt
of
sitting
on
the
front
row
at
Cameron
Indoor
without
having
to
tent
in
the
cold
for
weeks
,
our
sports
department
may
be
the
place
for
you
.
But
we’re
not
just
a
basketball
paper
we
cover
all
27
sports
,
from
our
national
champion
women’s
golf
team
to
our
bowl
winning
football
team
.
In
sports
,
you
can
cover
games
,
pen
hot
takes
or
even
write
about
the

But
what
if
you
want
to
cover
top
sporting
events
without
having
to
write
about
them
?
Our
photographers
get
right
up
close
to
all
the
action
sometimes
a
little
too
close
,
like
when
a
basketball
player
falls
on
them
at
a
game
.
And
when
they’re
not
shooting
sports
,
photographers
are
memorializing
big
speakers
,
protests
and
all
of
Duke’s
most
important
events
.
Don’t
forget
about
arts
and
culture
!
If
you
join
Recess
,
you
can
get
the
chance
to
review
movies
or
music
,
travel
to
film
festivals
like
Sundance
and
write
about
the
vibrant
arts
scene
here
on
campus
.
We
also
have
an
opinion
section
,
where
you
can
truly
spark
campus
conversations
on
hot
button
issues
.
Columnists
aren’t
just
yelling
into
the
void
opinion
pieces
are
widely
read
by
people
in
all
corners
of
the
Duke
community
and
can
make
lasting
change
.
If
none
of
those
sound
appealing
,
there
are
so
many
other
ways
you
can
get
involved
.
As
The
Chronicle
continues
transitioning
into
a
digital
first
publication
,
we
need
students
interested
in
graphic
design
,
social
media
,
coding
interactives
,
video
and
podcasting
to
take
us
to
new
heights
.
Come
and
get
some
real
world
experience
!
Student
journalism
,
whether
it’s
news
,
sports
,
arts
,
photography
or
opinion
,
can
be
messy
and
challenging
.
But
it’s
also
one
of
the
most
rewarding
activities
you
can
do
on
campus
,
even
if
you’re
not
interested
in
journalism
as
a
career
which
,
,
is
true
of
most
Chronicle
staffers
.
And
if
you
do
want
to
go
into
journalism
,
there’s
no
better
way
to
learn
than
by
doing
.
I
speak
for
everyone
at
The
Chronicle
when
I
say
please
help
us
further
our
mission
to
hold
Duke
accountable
and
tell
its
best
stories
.
I
can’t
wait
to
see
y’all
next
semester
.
As
if
Friends
remaining
on
Netflix
did
not
satisfy
the
heterosexual
public
enough
,
straight
pride
is
the
newest
act
of
defiance
against
the
rainbow
wave
.
Earlier
this
month
,
headlines
erupted
as
three
Boston
men
planned
a
straight
pride
parade
in
their
hometown
.
They
sought
to
satirize
the
identity
politics
of
the
modern
LGBTQ
pride
celebrations
taking
place
across
the
nation
.
These
men
felt
that
their
city
celebrating
gay
pride
was
a
form
of
favoritism
.
And
although
their
particular
action
was
dramatic
,
their
sentiment
that
the
pride
festivities
are
too
big
and
too
obnoxious
was
echoed
by
many
online
.
Several
people
have
innocently
asked
me
why
pride
is
even
celebrated
at
all
.
If
you
are
gay
,
that’s
cool
,
but
why
do
you
need
a
float
?
The
general
American
public
may
be
in
favor
of
the
most
basic
human
rights
for
queer
people
,
but
actual
acceptance
of
queer
humanity
eludes
us
.
This
tension
in
progression
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
narratives
of
gay
people
are
not
being
told
by
the
gay
people
themselves
.
On
June
28
,
1969
,
police
raided
the
Stonewall
Inn
,
a
popular
gay
club
in
New
York
City
.
nbsp
;
Stonewall
was
unique
in
its
function
as
a
place
of
refuge
for
gay
individuals
,
particularly
drag
queens
and
gays
of
color
,
who
were
marginalized
even
within
the
larger
gay
community
.
The
police
began
arresting
individuals
for
dancing
with
members
of
the
same
sex
,
forcefully
checking
the
genitalia
of
individuals
,
and
issued
tickets
to
butch
lesbians
for
wearing
gender
inappropriate
clothing
.
Such
a
raid
was
typical
,
but
on
this
night
the
patrons
fought
back
and
resisted
arrest
.
The
Stonewall
Riots
were
born
,
and
inspired
demonstrations
across
the
country
,
which
evolved
into
annual
pride
celebrations
.
Gatherings
of
the
LGBTQ
community
are
not
born
out
of
a
celebration
of
identity
they
are
born
out
of
necessity
.
Anti
gay
laws
and
social
settings
forced
queer
people
to
create
underground
communities
that
were
breeding
grounds
for
art
and
resistance
.
When
the
AIDS
crisis
struck
the
heart
of
gay
communities
,
and
the
U
.
S
.
government
ignored
their
suffering
,
gay
people
found
solace
in
each
other
.
When
queer
people
are
abandoned
by
their
families
or
ridiculed
by
their
peers
,
they
find
a
chosen
family
among
each
other
.
It
is
only
after
acceptance
from
others
that
we
begin
to
take
pride
in
our
identities
,
and
ourselves
.
This
long
,
difficult
development
in
every
queer
person’s
life
is
what
we
celebrate
this
June
.
Ideally
,
the
intricacies
of
queer
history
would
be
taught
by
queer
authors
and
artists
.
However
,
the
general
public
is
not
often
exposed
to
the
wider
realms
of
queer
media
and
entertainment
.
Instead
,
corporations
dominate
the
publicity
of
pride
through
advertisement
campaigns
and
logo
changes
on
social
media
.
Colorful
text
and
superficial
slogans
like
be
your
true
self
and
live
your
pride
are
the
representations
of
the
queer
community
in
this
modern
pride
season
.
The
acceptance
of
the
LGBTQ
community
by
corporate
America
happened
so
swiftly
in
the
past
few
years
that
these
powerful
voices
overtook
those
of
the
queer
community
itself
.
Pride
is
made
by
and
for
the
LGBTQ
community
.
The
glamorization
of
allyship
and
rainbow
capitalism
have
diluted
feelings
of
solidarity
that
come
from
purely
queer
communities
.
It
is
important
to
understand
that
historically
,
the
strength
of
the
LGBTQ
community
was
created
by
mutual
suffering
.
The
love
and
acceptance
found
in
a
group
of
other
queer
people
with
similar
experiences
is
what
births
that
community
.
As
a
gay
man
,
I
have
learned
not
to
seek
the
acceptance
of
my
straight
peers
.
And
I
certainly
do
not
seek
the
support
of
corporations
touting
the
rainbow
flag
.
I
attend
pride
to
relish
in
the
love
and
support
of
the
queer
community
.
I
enjoy
seeing
support
from
straight
people
,
and
I
understand
how
much
growth
it
requires
to
undo
societal
conceptions
.
But
I
will
never
rely
on
validation
from
the
general
public
.
For
those
who
still
don’t
understand
pride
,
just
don’t
go
.
You
won’t
exactly
be
missed
.
I
know
it’s
hard
to
avoid
the
swarm
of
corporate
advertisements
,
but
find
comfort
in
knowing
that
most
gay
people
are
annoyed
with
them
too
.
The
queer
community
is
not
looking
for
your
support
during
pride
.
The
disgust
and
intolerance
of
others
is
nothing
new
.
For
allies
,
feel
free
to
attend
pride
with
your
queer
friends
and
family
who
invite
you
.
Know
that
this
is
a
space
created
for
them
,
and
it’s
one
that
they
might
not
get
often
.
If
you
want
to
truly
show
your
support
,
you
can
donate
to
LGBTQ
causes
,
vote
for
LGBTQ
issues
and
educate
yourself
on
queer
history
.
Showing
up
with
a
group
of
rainbow
clad
straight
people
is
not
quite
a
demonstration
of
support
.
That’s
just
a
rave
.
If
you
do
end
up
attending
a
pride
celebration
,
you
might
see
an
assortment
of
risqué
activity
.
Maybe
some
old
folks
in
leather
,
a
scantily
clad
cosplayer
or
people
twerking
on
top
of
a
police
car
.
You
may
not
completely
understand
their
actions
,
but
you
can
respect
their
happiness
.
Queer
people
have
been
bold
,
rambunctious
and
provocative
for
decades
behind
closed
doors
.
Now
the
music
,
slang
and
colorful
attire
is
displayed
in
the
open
.
For
many
members
of
the
queer
community
,
this
is
pure
liberation
.
Among
the
sea
of
rainbow
costumes
and
glitter
clouds
at
pride
,
there
is
also
a
nervous
teen
staring
in
awe
at
the
spectacle
around
him
.
He
didn’t
tell
his
parents
where
he
was
going
and
wore
a
jacket
to
cover
up
his
rainbow
shirt
.
To
just
stand
there
is
an
accomplishment
seven
years
in
the
making
.
The
boldness
of
others
makes
him
feel
regular
,
for
a
singular
moment
.
And
he
catches
a
glimpse
of
the
happiness
his
future
holds
.

When
I
was
thirteen
,
I
failed
my
hearing
test
.
I
had
faced
problems
with
my
ears
before
recurrent
ear
infections
led
to
a
childhood
ear
surgery
,
as
well
as
some
reduced
hearing
ability
.
But
this
time
,
something
was
different
.
Unbeknownst
to
me
,
what
had
started
as
a
small
hole
in
my
right
eardrum
had
become
an
expanding
perforation
that
,
by
the
time
it
was
caught
,
was
the
size
of
my
eardrum
itself
.
It
would
end
up
taking
two
surgeries
and
about
a
year
to
reconstruct
my
eardrum
,
leaving
me
nearly
half
deaf
in
the
meantime
.
The
reconstruction
was
successful
though
I
am
still
mildly
hard
of
hearing
,
but
this
experience
transformed
the
way
I
view
the
world
.
Even
at
the
peak
of
my
half
deafness
,
I
did
not
miss
my
hearing
.
What
I
did
miss
,
however
,
was
being
a
full
participant
in
our
hearing
centric
society
.
I
pretended
to
laugh
at
jokes
I
couldn’t
hear
in
the
cafeteria
,
missed
out
on
educational
videos
without
captions
,
and
mourned
the
loss
of
whispered
middle
school
gossip
in
the
library
.
When
taken
together
,
these
small
,
everyday
inconveniences
caused
me
great
frustration
and
isolation
.
Accessibility
is
not
always
a
consideration
or
priority
for
people
to
whom
everything
is
accessible
,
and
many
of
my
friends
and
teachers
,
though
well
meaning
,
didn’t
always
understand
how
to
accommodate
me
and
ensure
I
was
included
.
Being
deaf
or
hard
of
hearing
is
not
a
bad
thing
it’s
just
different
.
Deaf
people
live
their
lives
just
like
hearing
people
do
,
from
driving
cars
to
enjoying
music
.
There
is
also
a
flourishing
Deaf
community
and
culture
with
which
many
Deaf
individuals
strongly
identify
.
This
is
why
many
Deaf
people
prefer
more
positive
terms
like
Deaf
gain
and
differently
abled
to
describe
themselves
,
instead
of
negative
ones
like
hearing
loss
.
As
I
learned
the
hard
way
,
though
,
this
doesn’t
mean
the
Deaf
don’t
face
accessibility
challenges
.
The
problems
I’ve
faced
as
a
hard
of
hearing
student
are
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
when
it
comes
to
accessibility
issues
for
the
Deaf
.
Because
I
can
use
and
understand
oral
English
,
I
can
interact
easily
with
hearing
people
.
Though
there
are
some
strategies
the
Deaf
can
learn
to
interact
with
oral
language
users
,
such
as
lip
reading
,
speech
therapy
,
and
cued
speech
,
these
are
not
languages
in
and
of
themselves
,
and
they
are
not
always
effective
an
experienced
lip
reader
,
for
example
,
may
still
only
catch
40
of
what
is
being
said
,
and
cued
speech
is
not
widely
known
and
used
.
It’s
because
of
this
that
Sign
Language
is
one
of
the
best
options
for
the
Deaf
.
In
America
,
the
Deaf
use
American
Sign
Language
,
or
ASL
.
Just
like
spoken
languages
,
there
are
many
different
sign
languages
,
and
each
one
has
its
own
grammatical
structure
,
vocabulary
,
and
regional
dialects
.
Everyone
deserves
language
,
whether
they
are
hearing
or
not
,
and
Sign
Languages
allow
the
Deaf
to
fully
communicate
in
ways
spoken
language
often
cannot
.
One
of
the
greatest
barriers
to
accessibility
for
the
Deaf
is
the
lack
of
ASL
education
and
cultural
knowledge
in
the
United
States
.
Imagine
boarding
a
plane
and
missing
out
on
vital
safety
information
,
or
being
unable
to
communicate
with
paramedics
during
a
medical
emergency
.
Or
,
imagine
being
unable
to
communicate
with
a
police
officer
who
doesn’t
understand
your
culture
,
needs
,
or
language
will
she
know
that
you’re
not
disobeying
orders
,
and
that
you
need
your
hands
to
talk
?
These
are
some
of
the
very
real
challenges
that
ASL
users
face
,
in
addition
to
general
inconveniences
,
social
isolation
,
and
educational
or
occupational
barriers
.
If
more
hearing
people
took
ASL
courses
,
though
,
things
could
look
much
different
.
A
person
who’s
learned
about
Deaf
culture
may
later
work
for
a
theater
and
advocate
for
inclusive
performances
,
and
a
doctor
who
knows
even
basic
ASL
may
be
able
to
get
life
saving
information
from
her
patient
before
the
interpreter
arrives
.
In
order
to
change
our
society
for
the
better
,
it’s
vital
that
hearing
people
have
the
ability
and
willingness
to
learn
about
Deaf
culture
,
accessibility
,
and
language
.
We
our
future
teachers
,
doctors
,
and
politicians
to
understand
the
necessity
of
accessibility
and
to
practice
it
in
their
own
careers
.
At
Duke
,
though
at
least
as
things
stand
this
is
not
an
option
.
We
are
shamefully
behind
when
it
comes
to
introducing
American
Sign
Language
to
the
curriculum
,
despite
overwhelming
student
interest
and
the
examples
set
by
our
peer
schools
.
In
the
two
years
since
I
started
the
Duke
American
Sign
Language
club
,
hundreds
of
students
expressed
interest
in
ASL
or
taken
our
free
,
weekly
lessons
.
As
a
tour
guide
,
I’ve
had
multiple
hard
of
hearing
students
join
my
tours
and
every
one
of
them
has
left
disappointed
that
Duke
,
unlike
its
peer
schools
like
Harvard
and
Yale
,
doesn’t
offer
ASL
education
.
By
not
offering
ASL
,
Duke
is
both
limiting
its
students
and
harming
our
school’s
accessibility
and
reputation
.
If
Duke
wants
to
realize
its
stated
values
of
inclusion
and
leadership
,
then
the
University
offer
ASL
education
and
begin
to
broaden
the
scope
of
its
accommodations
for
Deaf
and
hard
of
hearing
students
on
campus
.
On
October
31
,
the
North
Carolina
General
Assembly
passed
nbsp
;
a
bill
aimed
to
finance
storm
recovery
costs
.
However
,
a
provision
of
the
bill
that
would
have
allowed
Duke
Energy
to
raise
rates
indefinitely
was
removed
after
long
standing
public
pressure
.
Given
the
corporation’s
monopoly
status
in
the
state
,
this
change
would
have
allowed
them
to
rip
off
customers
and
create
an
even
deeper
disparity
in
energy
access
.
Though
the
incriminating
provision
is
no
longer
a
threat
,
the
power
and
abuse
of
Duke
Energy
continue
.
As
Duke
students
,
many
of
us
come
from
out
of
state
where
the
monopoly
and
reach
of
Duke
Energy
are
not
familiar
conditions
.
I
was
almost
a
full
year
into
my
Duke
career
before
I
heard
anything
about
Duke
Energy
.
Though
Duke
Energy
is
technically
a
separate
entity
from
the
university
,
we
are
students
of
a
University
that
was
funded
by
Duke
Energy
money
and
therefore
responsible
for
understanding
the
dark
sides
of
this
corporation’s
business
model
.
For
years
,
Duke
Energy
has
been
wreaking
havoc
on
North
Carolina
and
the
broader
United
States
.
The
local
energy
justice
nonprofit
NC
Warn
describes
Duke
Energy’s
business
model
as
build
power
plants
,
raise
rates
,
control
government
and
distort
public
debate
.
As
the
largest
energy
provider
in
the
United
States
and
a
monopoly
in
North
Carolina
,
Duke
energy
has
used
this
business
model
to
take
over
the
state
.
During
Duke
Energy’s
campaign
against
rooftop
solar
,
the
corporation
targeted
African
American
leaders
in
the
state
,
misinforming
them
that
solar
energy
in
North
Carolina
would
hurt
the
poor
.
However
,
a
letter
from
community
leader
Rev
.
Nelson
Johnson
reinforced
solar
as
helping
all
customers
by
reducing
overall
electricity
usage
,
thus
reducing
the
need
to
keep
building
expensive
power
plants
and
continually
raising
customer
rates
.
Duke
Energy’s
monopoly
in
the
state
of
North
Carolina
allows
them
to
abuse
their
power
,
and
they
do
so
by
spreading
lies
.
One
such
example
is
clear
through
Duke
Energy’s
disposal
of
coal
ash
at
six
different
sites
in
North
Carolina
.
In
2014
,
Duke
Energy
spilled
upwards
of
6
tons
of
coal
ash
,
polluting
North
Carolina
air
and
water
to
the
extent
that
the
state
was
deemed
one
of
the
sites
with
the
worst
contamination
of
coal
ash
.
At
Duke
Energy’s
Allen
Steam
plant
in
Belmont
,
the
cobalt
contamination
was
500
times
worse
than
healthy
levels
.
It
is
estimated
that
clean
up
at
even
one
contaminated
location
will
take
32
years
.
When
North
Carolina’s
environment
department
demanded
that
Duke
Energy
clean
up
coal
ash
contamination
at
six
of
its
power
plants
in
April
of
2019
,
Duke
Energy
appealed
the
decision
,
arguing
that
the
request
was
not
based
on
scientific
evidence
.
Prior
to
this
cleanup
request
,
Duke
Energy
had
already
been
approved
by
the
state’s
utilities
commission
to
raise
rates
on
customers
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
546
million
they
have
already
paid
in
clean
up
costs
.
How
is
it
that
Duke
Energy
gets
away
with
these
inhumane
actions
?
This
is
where
the
second
part
of
their
plan
comes
in
controlling
government
through
donations
.
In
2017
,
Duke
Energy
spent
over
a
million
dollars
lobbying
in
NC
,
over
a
million
dollars
on
local
and
federal
PACs
and
at
least
a
million
dollars
influencing
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
in
NC
.
This
corruption
can
be
found
among
politicians
of
all
parties
and
from
all
areas
of
the
state
.
A
tool
created
by
Energy
Justice
NC
,
a
coalition
of
organizations
in
the
state
that
are
fighting
for
energy
choice
in
North
Carolina
,
allows
constituents
to
calculate
the
amount
of
money
their
state
senators
and
representatives
are
receiving
from
energy
monopolies
.
Given
that
Duke
Energy
is
a
corporation
,
it
could
be
argued
that
we
,
as
consumers
,
can’t
expect
any
better
of
them
than
to
chase
profits
,
no
matter
the
cost
.
However
,
even
if
this
is
true
,
we
must
demand
better
of
our
lawmakers
and
educational
institutions
to
assert
checks
on
Duke
Energy's
power
.
As
Duke
students
,
we
must
understand
the
legacy
of
Duke
Energy
.
Duke
Energy
abuses
its
power
,
harming
people
across
the
state
of
North
Carolina
and
beyond
.
Duke
Energy
was
a
builder
of
wealth
for
the
family
who
endowed
our
University
,
and
the
entanglements
of
the
two
continue
today
.
Duke
planned
to
allow
Duke
Energy
to
build
a
fracking
gas
power
plant
on
Duke’s
campus
until
April
of
2018
,
when
the
University
announced
it
would
not
allow
construction
after
facing
pushback
from
student
and
community
activists
.
Just
last
week
,
a
piece
in
The
Chronicle
condemned
the
fact
that
this
year’s
Energy
Week
was
sponsored
by
none
other
than
Duke
Energy
.
We
must
demand
that
the
University
cut
ties
with
this
power
hungry
company
.
If
we
fail
to
do
so
,
then
we
are
complicit
in
Duke
Energy's
continued
havoc
on
both
our
environment
and
our
democracy
.
Whether
it
manifests
in
the
hate
filled
rhetoric
around
the
border
crisis
or
the
too
loud
chatter
of
a
neighboring
dorm
room
or
the
emotional
boundaries
we
all
hide
behind
sometimes
,
we’re
all
pretty
well
acquainted
with
walls
.
It
makes
sense
,
then
,
that
we’d
be
well
acquainted
with
the
Wall
lurking
on
the
periphery
of
our
own
campus
.
And
indeed
it
lurks
.
It’s
an
annoyance
when
we’re
attempting
to
cross
East
Campus
and
approach
Broad
Street
or
Markham
Avenue
.
It’s
absolutely
unsightly
and
I
mean
this
strictly
hypothetically
when
one
places
a
foot
on
the
top
of
the
wall
with
the
goal
of
gracefully
hurling
oneself
over
and
the
too
tight
jeans
finally
decide
to
rip
.
But
beyond
these
particular
inconveniences
,
the
Wall
is
relatively
unnoticed
.
First
years
are
the
main
inhabitants
of
East
Campus
yet
we
hardly
venture
past
its
boundaries
and
West
Campus
is
a
community
within
itself
.
The
Wall
fits
the
theme
of
our
siloed
lives
;
we
often
forget
there
is
a
world
outside
this
Institution
.
Sometimes
this
forgetting
is
unintentional
.
Like
when
our
idea
of
adventure
is
the
harrowing
,
shoe
muddying
trek
to
Cloche
Coffee
or
Mad
Hatter’s
.
But
sometimes
the
forgetting
is
a
Facebook
comment
about
the
rural
wasteland
of
Durham
.
Sometimes
it’s
more
purposeful
.
The
Wall
has
historically
been
a
physical
manifestation
of
the
divide
between
Duke
and
Durham
.
However
,
in
2012
,
Duke
added
two
access
points
for
pedestrians
to
venture
into
Duke
without
a
jean
ripping
attempt
to
hurl
oneself
over
the
East
Campus
periphery
.
In
Duke
Today
,
Mark
Hough
,
campus
architect
,
wrote
that
the
access
points
will
make
the
Bull
City
Connector
stop
at
Broad
and
Main
more
accessible
for
students
and
employees
.
Moreover
,
Duke
students
could
travel
beyond
the
once
completely
enclosed
boundaries
of
their
institution
.
Nonetheless
,
the
decision
to
add
two
access
points
was
negated
by
other
administrative
decisions
.
Last
year
,
Duke
pulled
funding
from
the
aforementioned
Bull
City
Connector
,
one
of
the
only
two
buses
servicing
the
Durham
public
that
stopped
on
Duke’s
campus
.
This
decision
showed
Duke’s
disregard
for
those
passengers
the
majority
of
whom
were
working
class
and
Black
.
In
many
ways
,
the
2012
addition
of
access
points
to
the
Wall
is
representative
of
the
well
intentioned
but
meager
attempt
to
bridge
the
Duke
Durham
divide
.
I
interviewed
my
friend
Bethlehem
Ferede
,
a
Durham
resident
and
now
a
first
year
at
Duke
,
about
her
perception
of
the
Wall
as
a
Duke
student
.
She
told
me
that
even
before
the
idea
of
physical
barriers
determining
borders
were
in
public
discourse
the
way
it
has
been
lately
,
the
wall
around
East
Campus
was
still
a
conflicting
presence
.
Growing
up
and
driving
past
that
wall
with
my
family
made
the
university
seem
like
this
magical
but
inaccessible
place
,
and
there
were
definitely
other
reasons
for
that
as
well
such
as
who
I
would
see
within
the
confines
of
the
wall
and
who
I’d
nbsp
;
see
living
on
the
outside
.
.
.
and
which
group
looked
more
like
me
,
but
the
wall
was
this
physical
manifestation
of
what
was
already
institutionally
true
.
Alternatively
,
growing
up
as
a
white
girl
in
Raleigh
,
I
was
aware
of
the
language
used
to
describe
Durham
.
It
was
sketchy
,
unsafe
,
and
crime
ridden
especially
in
comparison
to
the
racially
homogenous
land
of
suburbia
,
which
infiltrated
many
aspects
of
my
childhood
.
A
white
woman
recently
inquired
if
my
parents
were
afraid
to
send
me
to
Duke
given
the
lack
of
safety
in
Durham
.
I
said
no
,
and
she
responded
with
,
Well
,
at
least
the
campus
is
safe
.
Duke
was
and
continues
to
be
an
entirely
different
institution
than
the
city
in
which
it
resides
.
The
Wall
distances
us
from
Durham
by
seemingly
protecting
us’
us
being
white
Duke
students
.
In
order
to
investigate
the
consistency
of
the
messaging
behind
the
Wall
and
whether
or
not
it
was
always
meant
to
protect
,
I
emailed
my
professor
,
Dean
LB
Bergene
,
to
ask
some
questions
about
its
history
.
She
wrote
,
The
wall
was
built
back
in
1916
and
was
co
funded
by
the
Duke
family
and
the
city
of
Durham
.
.
.
My
guess
is
that
the
wall
was
probably
in
part
to
mark
the
boundary
of
campus
since
it
wasn’t
as
clear
as
it
is
today
.
The
creation
of
clear
boundaries
makes
sense
.
Students
want
to
know
when
they
are
setting
foot
off
campus
.
The
purpose
,
while
meant
to
necessitate
separation
,
was
not
overtly
malicious
.
And
today
,
the
Wall
distinguishes
the
periphery
of
the
running
trail
,
used
by
countless
members
of
the
community
,
even
beyond
Duke
students
,
faculty
and
staff
.
Dean
LB

What
I
like
about
the
wall
is
that
it
marks
the
location
of
the
walking
trail
around
East
Campus
probably
one
of
the
spaces
where
Duke
and
Durham
intertwine
in
a
visible
way
.
At
any
given
moment
,
you
see
a
cross
section
of
Durham
on
the
trail
.
So
how
is
it
possible
that
this
Wall
can
be
both
inviting
and
exclusionary
?
How
can
it
be
both
a
nbsp
;
physical
manifestation
of
the
Duke
Durham
divide
and
the
Duke
Durham
convergence
?
The
answer
,
I
believe
,
lies
in
the
spaces
it
cultivates
the
individuals
welcomed
within
its
boundaries
and
those
kept
outside
of
its
periphery
.
The
Wall
operates
within
the
cultural
context
of
our
community
.
Bethlehem
said
,
I
do
think
the
Wall
symbolizes
and
represents
so
much
more
about
this
school
than
people
think
.

especially
following

Gilbert

we
are
communicating
the
type
of
people
kept

But
when
we

the
entrances
or
jog
alongside
the
fellow
members
of
our
new
hometown
or
act
as
citizens
of
Duke
Durham
,
we’re
chipping
away
at
the
Wall
.
We’re
allowing
people
inside
.
Dean

wrote
Each
year
on
the
bus
tour
,
Dr
.
Malone
always
asks
if
the
wall
is
meant
to
keep
people
in
or
keep
people
out
.
I
think
both
are
true
.
I
think
both
are
true
as
well
.
We
,
as
Duke
students
,
have
a
decision
to
make
.
Will
we
continue
to
operate
within
the
marked
boundaries
,
afraid
to
muddy
our
shoes
and
rip
our
jeans
?
Or
will
we
walk
out
of
our
dorms
,
nbsp
;
embrace
the
gravelled
path
,
and
,
with
care
,
climb
over
the
artificially
placed
stone
?
Though
the
weather
is
chilling
and
the
leaves
are
falling
,
my
mind
has
been
traveling
back
to
a
different
change
in
the
seasons
.
Spring
of
this
year
brought
with
it
two
moments
that
would
change
my
life
,
though
I
didn’t
know
yet
that
they
would
.
My
doctor
told
me
that
pain
would
be
a
part
of
my
life
for
as
long
as
I
live
,
and
I
applied
for
an
internship
at
the
Resource
Center
for
Women
and
Ministry
in
the
South
.
Coming
to
terms
with
a
lifetime
of
hurting
means
that
it
often
feels
like
it’s
no
longer
just
pain
that
limits
me
,
but
also
the
mountainous
emotions
that
have
arrived
along
with
it
.
And
one
of
the
places
that
I
have
so
often
sought
peace
church
has
also
begun
to
feel
too
small
for
my
emotional
and
physical
suffering
.
Almost
every
space
I
occupy
rewards
the
moments
that
I
pass
as
able
bodied
,
pretending
as
if
neither
my
body
nor
my
spirit
are
hurting
.
Almost
.
This
semester
,
at
the
intersection
of
my
labor
and
my
faith
,
where
self
blame
,
shame
and
stigma
so
often
live
,
sat
instead
a
little
house
on
Watts
Street
.
This
house
is
the
home
of
the
Resource
Center
for
Women
in
Ministry
in
the
South
.
I
have
worked
for
four
different
nonprofits
in
the
past
year
,
each
of
which
I
love
dearly
.
But
I
could
tell
that
something
was
different
about
the
Resource
Center
within
minutes
of
arriving
for
my
interview
in
the
cozy
,
sunlit
room
full
of
books
,
art
and
the
debris
of
decades
of
advocacy
and
activism
.
I
sat
down
on
a
comfy
couch
,
and
Jeanette
asked
two
questions
,
back
to
back
.
Is
that
seat
comfortable
?
And
how’s
your
pain
today
?
I
knew
the
answers
to
both
of
those
questions
,
but
I
was
still
taken
aback
.
Jeanette
and
I
had
done
a
phone
interview
where
I
told
her
about
my
chronic
pain
,
but
I
wasn’t
expecting
her
to
bring
it
up
again
.
Why
was
she
asking
me
about
pain
when
we
had
work
to
do
?
It
turns
out
that
letting
one
another
see
both
the
shiny
and
the
less
shiny
parts
of
our
lives
is
the
work
that
the
Resource
Center
does
.
Everyone
whose
lives
are
touched
by
RCWMS
the
staff
,
the
interns
,
the
bank
tellers
,
the
postal
carriers
,
the
neighbors
are
regarded
as
complex
,
limited
,
beautiful
,
whole
persons
worthy
of
love
and
attention
.
That
means
that
when
it’s
raining
outside
,
we
might
work
from
home
and
stay
in
our
pajamas
.
It
means
that
I
never
once
logged
my
hours
,
that
Jeanette
trusted
my
friend
and
fellow
intern
and
I
to
do
what
we
said
we
would
do
.
It
means
that
sometimes
we
would
drop
what
we
were
doing
and
take
a
walk
around
the
block
.
It
means
that
more
than
once
I
would
find
myself
sitting
in
a
circle
,
the
youngest
one
in
the
room
,
surrounded
by
wise
women
.
It
means
that
snacks
and
tea
and
stretch
breaks
and
hugs
are
not
just
encouraged
,
but
required
.
It
means
that
the
Resource
Center
has
decided
that
it’s
going
to
do
both
work
and
faith
differently
,
and
it’s
inviting
anyone
who
wants
to
join
to
come
on
in
.
If
this
sounds
countercultural
,
it’s
because
it
is
.
It
took
me
weeks
to
become
accustomed
to
walking
into
the
Resource
Center
and
turning
off
the
part
of
my
brain
that
demanded
my
body
and
mind
ignore
their
pain
.
I
have
lived
for
so
long
in
a
world
that
positively
reinforces
the
moments
where
I
appear
to
be
in
less
pain
than
I
am
;
it
is
strange
and
fascinating
to
be
in
a
place
that
positively
reinforces
just
showing
up
and
being
myself
.
A
few
weeks
into
the
semester
,
I
left
the
Resource
Center
after
stuffing
envelopes
and
chatting
all
afternoon
,
and
the
poem
by
Mary
Oliver
popped
into
my
head
You
do
not
have
to
be
good
.
You
do
not
have
to
walk
on
your
knees
for
a
hundred
miles
through
the
desert
,
repenting
.
You
only
have
to
let
the
soft
animal
of
your
body
love
what
it
loves
.

Being
in
pain
does
not
make
me
bad
.
And
it
is
not
my
fault
that
I
am
in
pain
.
But
the
peculiar
way
that
capitalism
,
white
heteropatriarchy
and
hegemonic
religion
have
intersected
in
this
moment
has
done
a
good
job
of
convincing
me
that
both
lies
are
true
.
A
faithful
body
that
hasn’t
experienced
healing
is
disruptive
to
a
simplified
faith
that
shrinks
God’s
love
down
to
bodies
that
are
able
and
well
.
And
a
smart
mind
that
hasn’t
been
able
to
think
its
way
out
of
being
in
pain
is
disruptive
in
an
institution
and
workforce
where
one’s
worth
is
predicated
on
their
intellectual
productivity
.
My
body
disrupts
a
faith
and
a
labor
system
that
declares
that
our
bodies
are
good
only
insofar
as
our
bodies
are
productive
and
able
.
And
I
am
so
scared
of
appearing
weak
or
stupid
or
broken
in
the
spaces
I
occupy
that
I
use
my
work
and
my
faith
to
repent
for
being
in
pain
,
as
if
my
pain
was
my
fault
,
as
if
it
makes
me
anything
other
than
good
and
worthy
of
love
.
The
Resource
Center
said
to
me
this
semester
,
My
time
at
the
Resource
Center
is
ending
as
the
semester
ends
,
and
I
already
know
I
will
miss
it
deeply
.
The
world
we
all
live
in
lives
inside
each
of
us
,
calling
our
bodies
bad
when
they
hurt
or
look
different
or
feel
too
much
.
That
voice
is
loud
,
harsh
and
strong
.
But
this
semester
,
in
the
middle
of
all
that
racket
,
another
,
gentler
,
sweeter
voice
has
appeared
in
my
mind
.
I
hope
you
learn
how
to
let
it
appear
in
your
mind
,
too
.
It
says
,
you
do
not
have
to
be
good
.
You
just
have
to
be
here
.
It
is
enough
for
you
to
be
here
.
What
does
it
mean
to
see
structure
and
how
are
we
blind
to
it
?
Sometimes
I
feel
like
all
my
schooling
has
been
aimed
at
recognizing
and
identifying
my
own
blind
spots
.
Racism
,
elitism
,
and
privilege
seem
to
underlie
most
of
my
humanities
papers
or
class
discussions
.
nbsp
;
And
for
the
most
part
,
I
have
been
receptive
and
eager
to
understand
where
our
society
systematically
leaves
behind
some
groups
of
people
and
advantages
others
.
In
tenth
grade
,
I
wrote
a
blog
piece
entitled
I
Will
Not
Look
Away
College
Visits
and
Educational
Disparities
that
compared
my
Northeast
college
tour
with
some
of
the
drug
and
violence
issues
in
public
schools
near
my
home
in
Atlanta
.
I
remember
furiously
writing
on
the
plane
ride
home
thinking
about
nbsp
;
why
some
youth
have
access
to
significantly
better
education
opportunities
?
Why
is
the
difference
so
stark
and
so
closely
related
to
race
and
socioeconomic
status
?
My
dad
and
I
found
not
an
array
of
diverse
,
prospective
students
but
the
same
people
we
encounter
in
our
daily
lives
.
In
fact
,
I
ran
into
11
students
from
the
private
school
I
attend
in
the
Southeast
.
This
was
disheartening
and
a
display
of
elitism
that
promises
to
transcend
generations
.
The
same
people
who
currently
go
to
the
same
schools
,
have
the
same
social
groups
,
and
live
in
the
same
neighborhoods
will
continue
in
that
tradition
,
I
wrote
.
I
compared
this
trip
to
my
work
in
high
schools
with
students
struggling
with
drug
problems
.
I
remember
writing
about
these
schools
that
My
hands
shook
when
I
told
them
what
school
I
attend
,
and
I
found
myself
struggling
to
connect
with
their
situation
.
I
felt
overwhelmed
with
a
sense
of
guilt
and
shame
about
the
opportunities
that
I
had
related
to
school
and
educational
support
systems
that
these
kids
lacked
for
no
fault
of
their
own
.
In
my
Duke
seminar
class
about
similar
education
inequalities
,
I
have
learned
about
more
empirical
and
quantitative
ways
to
validate
my
own
feelings
of
stark
education
disparities
.
As
seemingly
obvious
and
unfortunate
as
ideas
like
education
inequality
are
,
the
conversations
around
them
are
still
uncomfortable
.
People
retreat
to
their
own
understandings
of
education
or
high
school
experiences
.
These
are
when
the
blind
spots
start
to
shine
.
Maybe
Thanksgiving
conversations
made
me
more
aware
of
this
hypocrisy
.
I
saw
it
in
myself
,
a
desire
to
avoid
conflict
discussing
issues
in
the
news
when
I
saw
that
what
I
understood
and
learned
on
Duke’s
campus
differed
from
the
life
I
grew
up
knowing
.
I
think
of
conversations
I
have
had
with
friends
and
teammates
on
Duke’s
campus
where
it
becomes
clear
that
truths
related
to
race
,
class
,
or
gender
on
campus
do
not
translate
to
their
home
lives
or
childhood
.
What
I
do
understand
is
that
as
uninspiring
and
counterintuitive
as
it
is
,
often
skepticism
is
our
greatest
tool
in
identifying
and
these
blind
spots
.
We
must
be
willing
to
challenge
and
sometimes
leave
behind
the
lessons
that
our
parents
or
close
relatives
give
.
To
allow
the
idea
that
an
experience
that
a
friend
from
across
the
country
has
to
contribute
is
just
as
valid
as
your
aunt
.
Otherwise
,
narratives
about
cultural
deficiency
or
lack
of
work
ethic
work
to
support
our
blind
spots
and
facilitate
a
misunderstanding
and
lack
of
respect
for
people
and
systemic
issues
.
There
is
a
difference
,
I
have
noticed
,
between
calling
out
structural
inequalities
in
a
class
discussion
versus
taking
action
in
real
life
.
What
irks
me
the
most
is
my
own
ending
to
the
blog
post
I
wrote
many
years
ago
.
I
said
,
And
now
that
I
see
this
,
I
plan
to
be
part
of
the
solution
,
and
not
the
passive
part
of
the
problem
.
I
will
not
look
away
.
But
how
have
I
been
part
of
the
solution
?
I
have
found
it
embarrassingly
easy
to
ride
the
advantages
presented
by
attending
Duke
and
forget
about
those
I
leave
behind
in
my
own
community
and
surrounding
communities
.
What
makes
it
so
easy
to
call
out
the
problem
and
so
hard
to
act
on
it
?
I
almost
feel
like
learning
about
the
deep
rooted
and
structural
causes
of
inequalities
makes
me
more
pessimistic
about
my
ability
to
create
any
real
change
.
It
becomes
easy
and
appealing
to
hold
onto
contradicting
anecdotal
information
that
tells
us
factors
like
racism
or
sexism
or
elitism
do
not
play
a
large
role
in
our
society
just
because
they
seem
to
big
to
fight
.
I
write
this
all
without
a
clear
answer
or
way
forward
but
as
a
loving
reminder
to
my
friends
,
my
peers
,
and
myself
to
not
let
frustrations
,
guilt
,
or
regret
feed
the
blindness
.
To
uninvolved
onlookers
,
the
troupes
of
students
lining
up
by
Shooters
are
there
for
a
good
time
.
In
several
ways
,
they
inspire
empowerment
.
The
same
,
huddled
students
walking
around
campus
in
sweats
and
yoga
pants
by
day
now
radiate
confidence
en
masse
,
dressed
in
flattering
clothing
and
encircled
by
seemingly
supportive
friends
.
Despite
the
happy
scene
,
there
is
copious
negative
discourse
on
clubbing
culture
.
After
all
,
such
giddiness
is
usually
inorganic
and
alcohol
induced
.
Various
thinkpieces
decry
the
fact
that
this
environment
is
a
breeding
ground
for
emotionless
hookups
and
sexual
assault
.
Despite
the
cynicism
in
intellectual
spheres
shrouding
the
party
scene
,
every
Saturday
I
hear
about
grand
plans
to
get
lit
at
Shooters
.
Every
Wednesday
,
when
I
am
despondently
returning
from
a
stressful
Perkins
grind
,
I
encounter
already
inebriated
groups
in
transit
.
I’ve
only
gone
to
Shooters
twice
since
my
first
semester
of
Duke
,
but
based
purely
on
how
often
I
went
during
the
first
two
weeks
of
college
,
a
stranger
might
mistake
me
as
a
hardcore
partygoer
.
For
someone
who
has
avoided
Shooters
for
so
long
,
I
can
remember
my
experiences
there
all
too
well
.
The
Saturday
after
my
first
week
of
classes
,
in
particular
,
stands
out
to
me
.
On
a
whim
,
I
made
the
questionable
decision
to
go
,
with
every
logical
reason
not
to
.
Now
,
I
realize
that
during
that
phase
of
my
life
,
I
was
not
in
my
emotional
prime
.
Already
,
I
felt
at
odds
with
my
academic
pathway
,
as
I
was
considering
dropping
half
of
my
classes
.
Along
with
that
,
there
were
the
seemingly
noncommunicable
pressures
to
find
a
niche
at
college
and
to
keep
up
with
the
unprecedented
amount
of
work
common
fears
that
few
first
years
vocalize
.
As
I
shoved
my
way
into
the
building
swimming
with
indistinct
faces
and
cavorting
bodies
,
I
knew
that
I’d
regret
this
outing
come
morning
.
Last
year
,
after
taking
Mark
Leary’s
personality
psychology
course
,
I
began
to
dissect
my
reasons
for
going
to
Shooters
in
the
first
place
.
During
one
of
the
lectures
,
we
looked
at
the
psychological
mechanisms
behind
motivation
.
One
prevailing
theory
outlines
two
independent
systems
that
inspire
the
motivation
behind
behavior
.
The
behavioral
activation
system
describes
behavior
motivated
by
reward
,
fun
and
ambition
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
behavioral
inhibition
system
stems
from
the
desire
to
avoid
negative
consequences
or
emotions
.
Even
if
two
people
exhibit
similar
behaviors
,
they
may
not
be
acting
on
the
same
system
.
Consider
two
high
school
students
,
both
at
the
top
of
their
class
.
The
one
acting
on
his
BAS
may
study
hard
because
he
wants
success
and
praise
;
the
other
,
riding
on
BIS
may
do
so
because
he
fears
the
shame
of
failure
or
criticism
from
high
strung
parents
.
Commonly
,
students
in
high
achieving
schools
,
such
as
Duke
,
tend
to
display
higher
than
average
levels
of
BAS
.
Personally
,
however
,
when
we
calculated
the
relative
influences
of
our
individual
BIS
and
BAS
levels
in
class
,
my
behavioral
inhibition
system
was
much
stronger
.
In
retrospect
,
my
rash
Shooters
voyage
was
a
very
BIS
influenced
decision
,
a
shirking
not
only
of
responsibility
but
of
fear
.
There
,
I
could
allay
all
my
unvoiced
concerns
.
I
found
that
my
goal
in
Shooters
becomes
experiencing
colors
and
sounds
in
their
full
intensity
,
to
taste
the
world
in
its
raw
,
unadulterated
form
.
As
long
as
there
is
no
immediate
danger
surrounding
me
,
there’s
a
strange
release
within
chaos
,
the
eye
of
a
hurricane
,
when
faced
with
more
immediate
and
arguably
pettier
dangers
things
such
as
oh
no
,
that
guy
next
to
me
doesn’t
look
stable
so
I
should
move
before
he
spills
his
drink
all
over
me
or
that
tall
kid
wants
to
get
to
the
middle
so
I
should
get
out
of
his
way
before
aggressive
shoving
ensues
.
The
string
of
temporary
annoyances
,
basking
in
their
two
seconds
of
fame
,
keep
overarching
concerns
,
like
existential
dread
or
homesickness
,
at
bay
.
It’s
the
same
kind
of
thrill
I
get
when
riding
a
rollercoaster
.
The
essence
of
life
boils
down
to
base
,
physical
conditions
rather
than
the
bigger
picture
.
Besides
running
off
to
Shooters
,
avoiding
fear
can
manifest
in
other
forms
that
range
in
healthiness
.
Since
last
year
,
I
have
found
less
dramatic
avenues
for
it
.
It
can
be
stress
baking
,
or
stress
gaming
.
It
can
be
lying
in
bed
,
unable
to
figure
out
where
productivity
starts
.
It
was
during
my
first
year
,
due
to
the
novelty
of
the
college
experience
,
that
I
experienced
these
emotions
stemming
from
situations
like
my
first
finals
season
,
the
influx
of
unfamiliar
social
situations
and
fear
of
drifting
away
from
high
school
friends
.
Psychologists
have
identified
several
defense
mechanisms
against
negative
emotions
.
My
Shooters
escapade
,
for
example
,
falls
under
compartmentalization
.
These
mechanisms
also
include
denial
,
a
process
by
which
some
people
convince
themselves
that
there
is
in
fact
nothing
wrong
,
and
rationalization
,
a
generally
healthier
process
that
occurs
when
people
make
valid
excuses
for
having
fears
.

It
is
my
opinion
that
the
University
itself
should
take
more
initiative
to
promote
students’
mental
health
,
especially
for
first
years
.
At
the
cusp
of
every
final’s
season
this
one
included
there
is
a
heightened
sense
of
anxiety
in
the
people
around
me
.
But
the
stress
of
finals
is
only
one
symptom
of
the
overall
fear
that
the
first
year
experience
entails
.
It
lies
in
stark
contrast
to
the
ecstatic
,
glimmering
O
week
events
that
Duke
showcases
at
the
beginning
.
During
my
O
week
,
I
learned
a
lot
about
Duke’s
academic
resources
through
countless
panels
and
convocations
,
but
didn’t
know
about
CAPS
until
later
in
the
semester
by
word
of
mouth
.
Perhaps
one
small
step
that
Duke
can
take
to
promote
mental
health
can
start
in
O
week
,
where
in
lieu
of
some
of
the
spectacle
,
the
University
could
provide
information
sessions
detailing
mental
health
resources
,
such
as
CAPS
,
or
student
groups
like
NAMI
that
sponsor
mental
health
awareness
initiatives
.
Frankly
,
Duke
can
be
a
very
stressful
place
,
and
it’s
easier
to
cultivate
support
networks
when
vulnerability
seems
normal
.
We
have
a
problem
with
our
toilets
.
Or
at
least
with
the
men’s
toilets
in
my
first
year
dorm
.
Problems
with
people
not
flushing
toilets
.
Problems
with
people
leaving
the
sinks
dirty
.
On
particularly
bad
occasions
,
the
bathrooms
smell
so
putrid
that
I
want
to
gag
.
What
could
possibly
explain
how
people
who
at
least
seem
clean
could
allow
such
an
important
place
to
get
so
dirty
?
What
drew
my
attention
to
this
question
was
an
article
written
a
few
weeks
ago
called
Masculinity
at
Duke
by
Austin
Smith
which
asks
the
same
question
.
Smith
attributes
the
problem
of
dirty
bathrooms
to
insecure
men
trying
to
exercise
power
and
convince
themselves
of
their
fertility
.
I
don’t
know
enough
about
the
subject
to
either
prove
or
disprove
his
argument
.
However
,
based
on
my
own
experience
with
public
bathrooms
,
I
suspect
that
another
reason
for
the
poor
state
of
the
men’s
bathroom
is
something
simpler
.
I
like
to
think
that
I
am
a
good
bathroom
citizen
most
of
the
time
.
I
clean
up
any
messes
I
make
in
the
toilet
,
and
will
flush
twice
if
everything
does
not
go
down
the
drain
the
first
time
.
But
whenever
there
is
something
that
seems
too
difficult
to
deal
with
,
or
which
does
not
seem
worth
the
effort
,
I
always
console
myself
by
thinking
The
janitors
can
deal
with
it
.
And
it
is
this
thought
that
is
at
the
heart
of
the
dirty
bathrooms
.
As
Smith
pointed
out
,
many
of
the
people
who
leave
public
bathrooms
a
mess
are
not
necessarily
lazy
or
messy
people
.
Many
of
those
people
who
regularly
trash
public
bathrooms
or
dorm
bathrooms
probably
have
perfectly
clean
bathrooms
at
their
homes
.
But
that
does
not
mean
that
they
never
get
their
home
bathrooms
dirty
.
I
know
,
since
there
have
been
many
times
I
been
responsible
for
some
sort
of
mess
at
home
.
Maybe
my
aim
is
not
as
good
as
it
could
be
.
Maybe
I
am
not
scrupulous
with
the
shower
curtain
and
some
of
the
water
spills
out
onto
the
floor
.
Whenever
that
happens
,
I
generally
clean
up
the
bathroom
.
One
difference
between
a
public
bathroom
and
a
home
bathroom
is
accountability
.
Only
a
few
people
live
in
most
houses
,
and
they
know
each
other
by
name
.
If
I
leave
a
mess
in
my
bathroom
,
my
mother
would
instantly
be
on
my
case
when
she
found
out
about
what
happened
.
However
,
in
a
toilet
which
dozens
,
maybe
hundreds
of
people
use
in
a
day
,
it
is
often
impossible
to
pinpoint
exactly
who
it
was
that
made
the
mess
,
reducing
the
incentive
to
clean
up
after
oneself
.
There
is
also
the
question
of
urgency
.
If
a
toilet
in
my
house
is
unusable
,
I
have
few
other
options
when
nature
calls
.
But
if
one
of
my
dorm’s
bathrooms
is
unusable
,
unless
it
is
a
true
emergency
,
I
can
just
go
and
find
another
bathroom
on
the
next
floor
.
And
due
mainly
to
the
hard
work
of
the
janitors
,
even
the
worst
mess
in
the
bathroom
is
only
a
temporary
inconvenience
.
All
of
this
means
that
there
is
far
less
incentive
to
clean
up
after
oneself
in
a
public
bathroom
.
The
end
result
of
these
circumstances
is
a
situation
where
the
benefits
of
an
action
are
concentrated
in
the
individual
but
the
costs
are
spread
to
the
entire
population
.
Economists
call
this
phenomenon
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
.
If
I
trash
the
bathroom
and
do
not
clean
up
the
mess
,
the
benefits
of
my
actions
are
reaped
entirely
by
me
.
I
save
a
few
seconds
of
my
precious
time
and
do
not
have
to
perform
the
icky
work
of
toilet
maintenance
.
But
the
costs
are
borne
by
the
people
who
go
to
the
bathroom
after
me
and
have
to
deal
with
the
mess
I
left
behind
,
or
the
janitors
whose
jobs
become
that
much
more
demanding
.
This
also
explains
other
infuriating
behaviors
on
campus
,
like
people
clogging
up
sidewalks
with
discarded
scooters
.
The
same
analysis
applies
the
individual
rider
benefits
from
not
having
to
waste
time
carrying
the
scooter
to
find
an
appropriate
parking
spot
,
but
the
people
who
use
the
sidewalk
afterwards
have
to
deal
with
the
consequences
of
this
action
.
On
a
larger
scale
,
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
also
explains
environmental
problems
like
overfishing
and
other
types
of
resource
depletion
.
What
is
the
solution
to
the
tragedy
of
the
commons
?
Are
we
forever
doomed
to
dirty
bathrooms
and
cluttered
sidewalks
?
Not
necessarily
.
As
this
video
notes
,
humans
are
capable
of
at
least
controlling
our
own
temptation
to
follow
narrow
self
interest
by
working
together
.
The
first
step
is
simply
stronger
enforcement
of
existing
rules
,
such
as
about
scooter
parking
.
Like
with
many
economic
problems
,
however
,
the
best
solution
involves
incentives
.
Any
policies
to
address
this
problem
need
to
be
designed
to
get
people
to
care
about
their
bathrooms
even
after
they
are
done
using
them
.
In
the
case
of
the
bathrooms
,
one
possible
solution
is
to
have
some
sort
of
dorm
wide
competition
which
rewards
the
people
whose
bathrooms
are
the
cleanest
with
some
sort
of
treat
or
party
.
Silly
as
this
may
sound
,
it
has
the
potential
to
make
people
want
to
think
about
the
way
they
use
their
bathrooms
,
because
,
according
to
my
experience
,
people
will
do
quite
a
lot
to
get
free
food
.
And
perhaps
,
using
incentives
,
it
may
be
possible
to
get
people
to
think
more
deeply
about
the
impact
they
have
on
the
places
we
share
.
As
we
return
from
Thanksgiving
break
for
the
final
week
of
classes
,
it’s
easy
to
get
wrapped
in
all
of
the
assignments
and
tasks
that
need
our
attention
before
we
head
home
for
Winter
Break
.
We
were
temporarily
withdrawn
from
the
craziness
and
commitments
of
being
at
Duke
to
spend
time
with
family
and
friends
,
only
to
return
to
Duke
a
couple
days
later
to
work
our
way
through
the
home
stretch
of
the
semester
.
Yet
,
this
set
of
events
overlooks
a
crucial
task
,
one
that
we
just
spent
an
entire
evening
eating
delicious
meals
surrounded
by
loved
ones
participating
in
giving
thanks
.
Despite
our
instinct
to
return
to
our
busy
routines
,
it’s
important
to
stop
and
think
about
the
amazing
opportunities
we
each
have
as
Duke
students
that
bring
us
here
in
the
first
place
.
First
and
foremost
,
our
university
provides
us
the
ability
to
learn
and
grow
.
Whether
we
came
into
college
knowing
exactly
what
we
wanted
to
study
or
we
didn’t
have
the
slightest
idea
,
Duke
enables
us
to
explore
a
variety
of
disciplines
.
In
my
past
three
and
a
half
years
,
I
have
taken
courses
in
17
different
departments
,
and
I’m
thankful
to
be
at
a
liberal
arts
school
which
offers
this
extent
of
academic
freedom
.
Duke
offers
so
many
academic
programs
,
course
structures
,
experienced
professors
,
and
supporting
resources
which
contribute
to
our
success
every
day
.
Through
seminar
style
classes
and
Flunches
at
The
Commons
,
innovative
educational
engagement
has
become
our
reality
.
Beyond
the
classroom
,
we’re
fortunate
to
be
at
a
university
with
so
many
institutes
,
programs
,
and
opportunities
that
we’re
paired
with
Directors
of
Academic
Engagement
just
to
help
us
navigate
them
.
From
hearing
former
U
.
S
.
Secretaries
of
State
and
U
.
N
.
Ambassadors
to
receiving
funding
for
conferences
and
internships
,
we
are
provided
a
unique
level
of
access
through
Duke
to
what
is
going
on
beyond
our
Gothic
campus
walls
.
Whether
through
volunteer
positions
in
Durham
or
across
the
globe
through
DukeEngage
,
or
by
studying
abroad
on
one
of
the
hundreds
of
DukeIn
or
Duke
Approved
programs
,
students
can
go
experience
the
world
for
themselves
.
I’m
thankful
to
know
that
if
there’s
something
I
want
to
pursue
,
there’s
something
or
someone
at
Duke
that
can
help
me
make
it
happen
.
I
remember
when
visiting
as
a
prospective
student
,
one
of
the
things
that
appealed
to
me
most
was
the
combination
of
students’
passion
and
ambition
with
their
collaboration
and
community
.
I’m
thankful
to
have
become
friends
with
amazing
students
coming
from
such
a
wide
variety
of
backgrounds
and
interests
,
hoping
to
contribute
to
the
world
in
their
own
unique
ways
.
A
Duke
experience
is
like
a
roller
coaster
,
with
exciting
highs
,
challenging
lows
,
and
everything
in
between
.
It’s
worthwhile
to
look
back
and
acknowledge
the
people
who
have
been
there
with
us
and
for
us
throughout
the
journey
.
Take
a
second
to
consider
what
makes
Duke
special
for
you
.
Would
it
be
the
screaming
voices
in
Cameron
Indoor
as
a
Blue
Devil
makes
a
buzzer
beater
to
win
the
game
or
the
late
nights
in
KVille
during
tenting
season
which
preceded
it
?
Would
it
be
the
beautiful
Chapel
that
towers
over
us
as
we
walk
through
West
Campus
or
the
peaceful
forested
area
preserved
right
behind
it
?
Would
it
be
the
themed
dinners
and
Midnight
Breakfast
in
Marketplace
or
the
delicious
taste
of
a
customized
pasta
bowl
from
Il
Forno
?
Would
it
be
the
O
Week
gathering
with
our
Blue
Devil
horns
in
the
lacrosse
stadium
or
the
celebrations
on
LDOC
as
a
given
year
comes
to
a
close
?
We
only
have
a
couple
weeks
left
before
finals
are
finished
and
we
take
a
break
from
our
lives
at
Duke
.
But
before
we
do
,
let’s
take
a
couple
minutes
away
from
our
hectic
schedules
to
remember
this
we’re
fortunate
enough
to
be
at
one
of
the
best
universities
in
the
country
surrounded
by
some
of
the
world’s
brightest
minds
.
We
not
only
have
the
opportunity
to
contribute
our
knowledge
in
the
service
of
society
,
but
to
have
an
enjoyable
college
experience
and
to
meet
fantastic
people
along
the
way
.
Although
we’ve
finished
our
2019
Thanksgiving
dinners
,
let’s
give
thanks
as
Blue
Devils
as
we
continue
on
our
journeys
at
Duke
.
Sometimes
,
Duke
feels
like
paradise
.
We’re
sheltered
by
our
own
private
police
force
.
We’re
consistently
offered
to
use
a
host
of
innovative
gadgets
courtesy
of
Duke’s
favorite
private
companies
.
We’re
flooded
with
so
much
technology
,
such
elaborate
new
buildings
,
and
so
many
private
amenities
that
it
almost
feels
like
they’re
hiding
something
.
If
there’s
so
much
luxury
to
choose
from
the
oasis
Duke
built
for
us
,
why
question
it
?
For
those
who
traditionally
bear
the
fruits
of
privatization
,
the
age
of
neoliberalism
might
seem
like
some
sort
of
utopia
.
For
those
of
us
concerned
with
protecting
the
sanctity
of
fundamental
human
desires
like
love
,
connection
to
our
natural
environment
,
and
freedom
from
becoming
cannibalized
by
an
endless
profit
motive
a
religious
infatuation
with
the
market
threatens
what
we
care
about
most
.
Despite
Senior
Annie
Yang’s
incisive
portrayal
of
how
neoliberalism
manifests
at
Duke
by
taking
the
money
we
don’t
have
to
transform
us
into
marketable
objects
for
sale
to
the
highest
bidder
we’re
left
with
responses
claiming
every
social
ill
cannot
be
explained
by
a
single
concept
.
This
confusion
is
to
be
expected
as
it
is
impossible
to
demonstrate
every
way
the
socio
political
system
dominating
our
world
makes
itself
present
.
What
we
can
do
is
isolate
aspects
of
the
theory
of
neoliberalism
and
highlight
the
examples
of
their
fruition
.
The
most
pernicious
feature
of
neoliberalism
is
its
steadfast
commitment
to
incorporating
our
most
human
capacities
into
the
marketplace
.
David
Harvey
explains
this
underlying
logic
It
holds
that
the
social
good
will
be
maximized
by
maximizing
the
reach
and
frequency
of
market
transactions
,
and
it
seeks
to
bring
all
human
action
into
the
domain
of
the
market
.
Luckily
,
we
don’t
need
to
imagine
what
a
world
,
or
a
Duke
,
inundated
by
a
dogma
of
marketization
looks
like
.
We’ve
had
one
for
40
years
.
We
can
easily
draw
connections
between
neoliberalism’s
obsession
with
the
expansion
of
market
activity
and
the
way
Duke
repackages
and
emblemates
that
mania
,
just
on
a
smaller
scale
.
Take
the
environment
as
a
case
study
.
The
neoliberal
epoch
led
to
trading
off
state
control
of
natural
resources
for
market
oversight
,
leading
to
a
type
of
aggressive
capitalism
that
prioritized
profits
in
every
dimension
.
Expanding
corporate
power
stifled
regulation
and
burned
enough
fossil
fuels
to
solicit
climate
disruption
the
Earth
has
never
seen
before
.
We
live
in
a
world
with
ever
increasing
emissions
,
seven
million
premature
deaths
each
year
from
pollution
,
and
an
ever
shrinking
window
of
opportunity
to
protect
our
way
of
life
.
Duke’s
leadership
follows
suit
.
The
prioritization
of
the
market
in
the
face
of
a
humanist
alternative
has
been
thoroughly
documented
it
won’t
divest
from
fossil
fuels
like
UMass
or
Syracuse
,
it
deals
intimately
with
Duke
Energy
the
country’s
second
heaviest
polluter
,
and
it
defends
these
positions
as
good
they’re
profitable
.

Likewise
,
Duke’s
relationship
with
Durham
residents
is
a
microcosm
of
the
way
neoliberalism’s
market
forces
displace
marginalized
people
only
to
subsume
them
into
the
money
making
machine
.
One
of
the
first
projects
neoliberalism’s
enforcers
the
IMF
,
World
Bank
,
and
the
U
.
S
took
on
in
this
new
era
was
NAFTA
a
trade
agreement
that
granted
multinational
corporations
the
power
to
sue
local
governments
over
loss
of
profits
,
displaced
five
million
Mexican
farmers
from
their
land
,
and
kickstarted
the
influx
of
immigration
that
American
companies
could
use
for
cheap
labor
.
nbsp
;
It
is
eerily
reminiscent
of
how
,
as
the
editorial
board
highlights
,
Duke
amplified
the
process
of
Durham’s
gentrification
by
using
millions
of
feet
of
city
land
for
private
enterprise
,
spending
millions
of
dollars
on
projects
that
indirectly
force
people
from
their
homes
,
and
capitalizing
on
that
precarity
by
hiring
many
of
those
people
for
less
than
a
living
wage
.
But
what
does
NAFTA
have
to
do
with
Duke
and
Durham
?
Let’s
follow
the
patterns
The
two
sets
of
policies
were
enacted
disparately
,
in
different
rooms
at
different
times
.
Duke
,
The
IMF
,
and
the
World
Bank
didn’t
work
together
,
but
that’s
the
point
.
They
didn’t
need
to
coordinate
.
They
were
unified
by
an
allegiance
to
the
market’s
power
,
intertwined
by
a
confluence
of
interests
that
create
their

motor
of
self
justification
.
No
matter
how
tight
the
invisible
hand’s
grip
on
our
collective
conscious
may
seem
,
we
should
never
think
it
to
be
unbreakable
.
Instead
,
our
response
should
be
to
deconstruct
the
myths
responsible
for
trapping
our
relationship
with
the
world
inside
the
market’s
bounds
.
Even
at
the
highest
levels
,
shown
by
the
1999
Seattle
WTO
protests
which
set
off
a
wave
of
action
against
the

doctrine
,
there

workers
went
on
strike
for
better
wages
in
2019
,
the
most
since
1986
.
The
Sunrise
Movement
and
Extinction
Rebellion
are
rallying
thousands
in
protest
for
unprecedented
climate
action
.
Protesters
at
the
border
are
taking
on
powerful
retaliation
to
stand
in
solidarity
with
those
detained
.
Organizing
against
neoliberalism
is
possible
,
and
necessary
,
at
Duke
too
.
Duke’s
unions
recognize
the
need
to
tussle
against
market
fanaticism
.
Student
led
groups
like
the
Duke
Climate
Coalition
and
research
triangle’s
Sunrise
Movement
hub
are
awakening
the
salience
of
our
school’s
complicity
in
the
climate
crisis
and
the
need
to
do
something
about
it
right
here
on
campus
.
Others
are
rejecting
Duke’s
relationship
with
Palantir
,
the
company
most
proud
of
helping
detain
people
at
the
border
.
Just
as
neoliberalism’s
pathologies
reappear
throughout
the
hierarchy
of
power
,
from
the
IMF
and
Mexico
to
Duke
and
Durham
,
its
remedies
follow
.
The
only
problem
is
that
because
of
the
market’s
decades
long
head
start
,
we
have
a
lot
of
catching
up
to
do
.
Discrepancies
in
what
is
needed
and
what
is
being
done
should
engender
urgency
,
not
fatalism
.
If
you’re
anxious
about
the
state
of
the
world
that
means
you’re
a
person
with
a
heart
,
and
that
you
should
find
others
like
you
to
help
fight
the
roots
of
that
unease
.
What
a
world
beyond
neoliberalism
would
look
like
is
not
yet
clear
.
However
,
a
known
,
necessary
prerequisite
for
achieving
that
world
is
a
broadened
framework
that
includes
organization
outside
of
market
transactions
,
between
humans
with
common
goals
.
Not
between
buyers
and
sellers
,
lenders
and
debtors
,
or
investors
and
entrepreneurs
.
We
need
to
shift
away
from
thinking
of
ourselves
as
individual
economic
actors
towards
understanding
and
mobilizing
our
power
,
as
a
collective
,
to
demand
that
when
the
choice
between
people
and
profits
presents
itself
we
choose
people
every
time
.
What
does
homecoming
mean
to
you
?
For
some
,
it
signifies
an
American
tradition
of
a
semi
formal
dance
following
a
football
game
.
For
some
,
it’s
the
emotions
associated
with
the
complex
matter
of
family
or
lack
thereof
.
For
others
,
it’s
just
an
awesome
Kanye
West
song
.
For
me
personally
,
it
means
returning
to
the
temporary
small
town
charm
of
Bethany
,
Connecticut
.
Homecoming
means
miles
of
wooded
landscapes
and
hills
,
the
crisp
chill
of
oncoming
winter
,
and
driving
past
the
places
I
drove
past
millions
of
times
during
high
school
,
the
sweet
tinge
of
nostalgia
heavy
in
the
air
.
As
soon
as
I
come
home
,
for
better
or
for
worse
,
I
feel
myself
conforming
into
the
usual
comfortable
habits
of
mine
.
I
sit
in
front
of
my
electric
heater
on
my
phone
for
a
little
too
long
in
my
room
just
like
I
did
for
so
many
nights
procrastinating
doing
my
homework
or
after
coming
back
from
swim
practice
.
I
wake
up
early
but
barely
eat
breakfast
like
I
did
in
high
school
.
I
constantly
make
my
room
a
mess
by
throwing
piles
of
clothing
on
the
ground
every
time
I
try
to
figure
out
what
to
wear
.
But
I
also
feel
myself
conforming
to
old
and
comfortable
habits
within
my
relationships
with
people
.
I
continue
to
reserve
the
reality
of
where
I’m
going
out
,
with
whom
,
and
my
feelings
with
my
parents
.
I
speak
to
my
friends
about
memories
of
high
school
as
we
sit
at
the
same
restaurants
or
shops
we
always
have
.
And
afterwards
,
we
drive
on
the
highway
,
blasting
our
music
with
the
windows
down
like
we
did
almost
every
weekend
because
really
,
what
else
is
there
to
do
in
a
suburban
town
?
As
I
do
all
the
things
I
once
did
every
weekend
throughout
all
of
high
school
,
I
wonder
to
myself
;
although
on
the
outside
,
I
seem
to
be
going
through
the
same
motions
,
am
I
any
different
on
the
inside
?
I
left
Bethany
,
Connecticut
to
change
and
grow
into
a
different
person
,
but
when
I
am
home
,
it
almost
feels
like
I
am
launched
four
months
into
the
past
.
Being
at
college
for
only
three
months
may
not
be
enough
time
to
radically
change
,
but
there
must
be
some
tangible
change
,
right
?
After
all
,
it
has
been
the
first
period
of
my
life
in
which
I
have
really
lived
away
from
home
and
on
my
own
.
I
know
,
upon
coming
to
Duke
,
that
I
actually
have
already
changed
in
significant
ways
.
I
have
become
more
independent
,
more
accountable
,
and
more
confident
in
myself
and
my
role
here
as
a
Duke
student
.
But
do
these
changes
,
these
growths
of
my
character
,
simply
dissipate
when
I
come
back
to
my
hometown
?
Perhaps
it’s
not
that
they
dissipate
,
but
the
overwhelming
aura
of
comfort
overwhelms
these
changes
in
my
identity
.
In
reality
,
it’s
so
easy
to
sink
back
into
the
comfort
of
my
usual
routines
,
who
I
was
before
,
and
the
nature
of
the
relationships
I
once
had
before
.
In
a
place
where
everyone
knows
your
name
,
it
feels
natural
to
morph
back
into
their
expected
version
of
you
,
before
you
took
the
risk
and
challenges
associated
with
living
miles
away
from
home
.
Sometimes
,
this
comfort
can
be
dangerous
,
though
.
Being
immersed
in
how
my
life
used
to
be
can
put
a
rose
colored
tint
on
this
period
in
my
life
.
The
happiest
memories
always
seem
to
surface
the
most
quickly
,
and
this
can
make
me
long
for
and
desire
to
stay
in
the
past
,
in
the
moments
before
I
pushed
myself
out
of
my
comfort
zone
.
It
can
make
me
forget
the
allure
of
life
here
at
Duke
yes
,
obviously
stressful
,
but
filled
with
unexpected
and
spontaneous
moments
of
excitement
,
passion
,
new
communities
,
and
most
importantly
,
new
experiences
.
Homecoming
is
ultimately
an
enjoyable
event
for
me
;
I
get
to
see
my
friends
,
family
,
shower
without
shower
shoes
,
and
just
breathe
for
a
second
.
But
the
mentality
of
home
,
the
versions
of
ourselves
we
are
at
home
,
have
to
stay
home
.
In
order
to
move
on
and
grow
here
at
Duke
,
I
have
to
cut
ties
with
a
certain
version
of
myself
that
is
living
in
the
past
.
After
all
,
she
will
always
be
there
when
I
come
home
again
.
A
few
months
ago
my
mother
carried
me
to
the
ER
after
I
had
passed
out
in
the
parking
lot
only
a
few
feet
from
the
hospital
entrance
.
I’d
spent
the
hour
prior
with
abdominal
pain
piercing
through
the
right
side
of
my
body
.
My
family
members
had
watched
me
as
I
withered
in
pain
on
my
living
room
couch
.
In
any
other
case
,
this
would
have
simply
been
an
unfortunately
painful
stomach
ache
.
Stop
being
so
dramatic
,
my
sister
joked
in
the
living
room
prior
to
the
hospitalization
.
Surgery
?
Oh
crap
,
she
said
hours
later
in
the
ER
.
Ultimately
this
was
physical
pain
coupled
with
a
quick
and
easy
operation
to
fix
.
Appendicitis
and
an
appendectomy
.
Not
a
big
deal
considering
how
common
it
is
,
but
still
painful
nonetheless
.
Do
you
have
any
metals
in
your
body
?
the
nurse
asked
.
Does
lithium
count
?
I
laughed
.
The
hospital
bed
wasn’t
so
bad
.
I
definitely
preferred
this
to
the
one
without
my
personal
belongings
and
a
helper
watching
over
my
every
move
.
I
remember
thinking
how
I’d
promised
my
best
friend
I
wouldn’t
land
myself
in
the
hospital
again
any
time
soon
.
I
suppose
that
was
limited
to
psychiatric
hospitalizations
,
so
this
didn’t
really
count
.
But
it
is
quite
funny
,
isn’t
it
?
That
my
being
in
the
hospital
for
appendicitis
was
loads
simpler
to
explain
to
people
than
telling
them
about
my
other
illness
,
you
know
,
the
less
obvious
one
.
They
certainly
couldn’t
see
my
inflamed
appendix
and
neither
could
I
ever
again
after
that
pesky
thing’s
been
removed
,
but
they’d
get
it
.
They
wouldn’t
be
utterly
terrified
of
my
being
hospitalized
for
such
a
reason
,
or
secretly
doubt
to
themselves
whether
I
was
telling
them
the
truth
,
or
wonder
if
I
was
making
it
all
up
just
to
avoid
responsibilities
,
or
perhaps
that
if
I
had
just
exercised
enough
and
meditated
and
ate
the
right
foods
and
thought
positively
I
wouldn’t
have
gotten
appendicitis
in
the
first
place
.
No
one
would
dare
insist
I
hold
off
on
taking
painkillers
to
ease
the
post
surgery
pain
.
Why
,
then
,
is
the
rhetoric
surrounding
a
mental
health
hospitalization
all
too
different
?
Gosh
,
if
only
was
the
easy
way
out
.
It’d
probably
make
it
a
whole
lot
easier
to
accept
the
idea
of
gaining
tons
of
weight
on
antipsychotics
or
side
effects
from
antidepressants
.
Because
unless
there
is
a
blood
test
,
an
x
ray
,
a
doctor
telling
you
your
appendix
has
been
filled
with
pus
and
you
then
have
three
triangular
scars
to
prove
it
afterwards
,
it’s
all
in
your
head
and
you’re
just
not
trying
hard
enough
.
The
first
question
I
asked
the
doctor
after
my
appendix
was
removed
was
,
can
I
keep
it
?
At
the
time
it
may
have
seemed
pretty
odd
to
ask
that
question
,
but
in
hindsight
I
have
truly
been
so
conditioned
to
disbelieve
my
mental
health
symptoms
that
I
felt
I
must
ask
to
carry
proof
of
my
physical
ailments
as
well
lest
I
get
doubted
again
.
And
again
.
And
again
.

I
hope
there
comes
a
day
when
we
can
learn
to
stop
listening
to
those
who
continue
to
doubt
whether
I
and
others
living
with
mental
illness
are
truly
struggling
.
Whether
our
symptoms
are
real
,
or
we’re
just
seeking
attention
.
Whether
we’re
truly
sick
,
or
we’re
just
not
trying
hard
enough
.
Whether
we’re
making
improvements
,
or
were
just
faking
all
along
.
Whether
we
should
keep
our
struggles
to
ourselves
to
prevent
from
burning
under
the
stigma
,
or
share
it
with
others
only
to
face
the
outcome
we
so
badly
wanted
to
avoid
.
It’s
about
time
we
start
changing
how
we
view
mental
illness
.
The
first
time
I
went
in
for
a
meeting
at
the
Community
Empowerment
Fund
CEF
,
I
was
hungover
.
I
guess
it’s
been
a
running
theme
in
my
college
career
going
to
class
and
meetings
and
workouts
hungover
,
and
hoping
nobody
will
notice
.
Mr
.
Kennedy
noticed
right
away
,
and
when
I
asked
him
how
he
could
possibly
tell
,
he
gave
me
a
wink
and
said
,
Takes
one
to
know
one
.
We
were
fast
friends
from
then
on
,
working
on
resumés
and
job
applications
,
cracking
jokes
and
calling
debt
collectors
.
We
spent
two
years
working
together
and
I
never
showed
up
hungover
again
we
held
each
other
accountable
.
In
my
four
years
working
with
CEF
,
I’ve
met
with
dozens
of
people
,
some
close
to
my
age
,
some
close
to
my
grandma’s
.
I’ve
built
close
bonds
and
found
lasting
friends
,
and
along
the
way
,
witnessed
the
deep
and
abiding
injustice
that
characterizes
inequality
in
Durham
.
At
2
p
.
m
.
on
Mondays
,
I
sit
in
a
floor
to
ceiling
glass
box
eating
sushi
.
By
3
p
.
m
.
,
I’m
in
a
swivel
chair
trying
to
find
financial
assistance
to
cover
a
75
utility
bill
that
hangs
like
a
dark
cloud
over
the
end
of
the
month
.
The
holiday
season
is
an
important
time
for
CEF
a
time
to
raise
funds
and
gain
support
,
both
on
campus
and
off
.
This
year
,
our
development
team
announced
a
new
initiative
aimed
at
doing
just
that
a
CEF
partnership
with
Campus
Enterprises
.
At
some
point
in
my
life
,
I
don’t
think
I
would’ve
seen
a
problem
with
this
.
Sure
,
I
could
have
acknowledged
that
Campus
Enterprises
was
an
elitist
organization
that
restricted
membership
to
students
able
to
pay
its
7
,
000
buy
in
.
Sure
,
I
would’ve
been
uncomfortable
with
the
idea
that
19
year
old
kids
with
money
would
be
in
charge
of
adults
with
children
and
utilities
bills
cleaning
dorm
rooms
for
a
living
.
But
in
the
end
,
I
would
have
justified
a
partnership
,
asserting
that
the
end
more
money
for
financial
empowerment
and
community
justice
made
up
for
the
means
.
I
can’t
see
it
like
that
anymore
.
CEF
is
an
organization
fighting
against
all
forms
of
economic
exploitation
in
Durham
and
Chapel
Hill
.
It
aims
to
uproot
a
hierarchy
that
would
allow
some
to
play
with
money
and
others
to
sleep
on
a
bench
because
they
lack
it
.
Pursuing
this
partnership
with
an
organization
entrenched
in
that
hierarchy
compromises
those
values
.
And
the
hypocrisy
was
built
into
the
partnership
.
At
CE
x
CEF
hosts
Devine’s
on
Thursday
night
,
partygoers
were
invited
to
spin
a
wheel
to
win
a
free
Maid
My
Day
clean
or
20
in
GoBringIt
credit
.
The
cleaners
and
the
drivers
actually
executing
those
services
could
be
coming
in
to
CEF
for
financial
assistance
,
based
on
their
wages
.
According
to
the
CEO
and
CFO
of
Campus
Enterprises
,
cleaners
for
Maid
My
Day
three
adults
who
signed
non
compete
contracts
in
order
to
work
for
CE
make
20
per
hour
,
below
the
average
hourly
rate
across
the
US
.
In
comparison
,
the
photographers
hired
by
Enterprise
Entertainment
to
work
sorority
formals
most
of
whom
are
Duke
students
with
no
dependents
make
30
an
hour
.
The
student
DJs
hired
to
work
these
same
events
make
60
an
hour
,
three
times
the
wage
of
a
cleaner
.
Finally
,
there’s
the
labor
contracted
to
deliver
SushiLove
and
the
Loop
to
Duke
students
for
GoBringIt
15
drivers
from
around
Durham
paid
4
.
25
an
hour
plus
tips
though
CE
guarantees
at
least
11
an
hour
,
paying
the
difference
on
slow
nights
.
The
injustice
here
isn’t
just
in
the
low
wage
for
community
members
,
though
.
It’s
in
the
cut
that
CE
takes
from
every
transaction
.
If
a
sorority
wants
to
hire
a
photographer
for
their
party
,
they’ll
be
charged
65
per
hour
more
than
the
wage
that
the
photographer
actually
keeps
.
For
a
DJ
,
they’d
pay
110
an
hour
,
meaning
CE
takes
a
45
cut
of
the
deal
.
And
of
course
,
for
Maid
My
Day
,
the
margins
are
similar
.
If
I
wanted
to
have
my
off
campus
house
cleaned
,
I’d
be
charged
the
standard
rate
of
45
.
Even
if
the
cleaner
took
an
hour
and
a
half
to
finish
that
gig
,
they’d
still
only
make
30
out
of
the
45
I
paid
.
The
other
third
of
the
price
goes
to
the
company
,
for
serving
as
the
middleman

When
I
asked
about
these
wages
,
I
was
given
some
justification
apparently
,
the
cleaning
team
gets
a
bonus
every
semester
of
about
100
.
Meanwhile
,
the
shareholder
dividends
guaranteed
to
the
active
student
members
of
CE
are
between
1
,
000
1
,
500
per
semester
,
depending
on
performance
.
The
success
of
what
is
often
called
a
rewarding
experience
or
a
step
to
a
dream
job
at
Facebook
hinges
on
working
class
labor
,
exploited
and
managed
by
college
students
.
And
even
then
,
only
a
few
college
students
the
company
relies
on
reinforcing
classism
at
Duke
in
requiring
shareholders
to
buy
in
for
equity
.
What
college
student
actually
has
that
kind
of
cash
?
According
to
the
CEO
and
CFO
,
only
one
out
of
their
41
shareholders
is
Black
.
When
I
asked
if
there
were
any
shareholders
from
Durham
,
they
told
me
there
were
three
or
four
from
the
And
though
CE
offered
financial
aid
to
six
members
in
its
new
class
of
15
shareholders
,
one
has
to
wonder
who
is
being
discouraged
from
applying
in
the
first
place
?
All
of
this
isn’t
to
name
and
shame
my
peers
.
But
it
is
to
give
an
answer
to
those
who
wonder
how
so
many
Duke
students
will
go
on
to
work
at
Palantir
and
McKinsey
and
become
complicit
in
locking
children
up
at
the
border
.
Duke
raises
us
to
replicate
the
elitist
,
oppressive
conditions
that
got
us
here
in
the
first
place
especially
those
of
us
that
come
from
wealth
.
Duke
teaches
us
to
ignore
human
rights
violations
and
dismiss
them
as
a
necessary
evil
.
Duke
teaches
us
not
just
to
be
complicit
but
to
actively
propagate
injustice
,
and
then
turn
around
and
slap
a
donation
on
top
to
make
it
all
okay
.
The
CE
shareholders
of
today
are
the
billionaires
of
tomorrow
,
the
ones
convinced
they
are
good
people
because
they
participate
in
corporate
social
responsibility
and
give
10
of
their
sales
revenue
to
CEF
.
I
refuse
to
replicate
that
.
And
I
hope
that
if
not
for
our
own
principles
,
then
for
our
community
members’
livelihoods
CEF
would
too
.
In
my
time
working
for
housing
justice
in
Durham
,
I
have
seen
people
lose
cars
,
homes
,
and
lives
to
just
200
in
hospital
bills
or
electricity
fees
.
With
all
due
respect
to

For
essentially
all
of
2019
,
I
have
been
straight
up
not
having
a
good
time
.
It
seems
everyone
I
care
about
has
been
hurting
at
some
point
,
in
more
ways
than
I
can
list
in
this
column
.
After
my
two
best
friends
and
I
all
lost
a
grandmother
in
the
span
of
ten
days
,
we
half
jokingly
began
typing
up
a
Google
Doc
to
record
the
year’s
catastrophes
.
The
file
is
entitled
2019
curse
and
is
now
three
pages
,
single
spaced
.
This
year
has
simply
not
been
an
easy
one
.
Despite
all
of
the
bullet
points
on
that
list
,
one
blessing
has
graced
and
sustained
my
life
throughout
the
darkest
moments
the
Bon
Appétit
YouTube
channel
.
I
don’t
want
to
be
dramatic
who
am
I
kidding
,
of
course
I
do
,
but
it
does
not
feel
like
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
it
is
the
best
thing
that
has
happened
to
me
this
year
.
If
you
aren’t
one
of
Bon
Appétit’s
4
.
82
million
YouTube
subscribers
,
you
might
appreciate
some
context
.
The
Bon
Appétit
channel
,
like
the
magazine
,
is
centered
around
food
.
Most
of
their
content
consists
of
tutorials
where
test
kitchen
staff
members
walk
the
viewer
through
a
recipe
,
but
they
also
have
several
video
series
where
specific
editors
complete
more
specialized
tasks
and
activities
.
For
example
,
in
Gourmet
Makes
,
senior
food
editor
and
my
personal
role
model
Claire
Saffitz
is
challenged
to
recreate
and
perfect
popular
snack
foods
like
Twinkies
or
Doritos
.
Other
series
focus
on
everything
from
exploring
food
fermentation
to
guest
celebrities
cooking
gourmet
dishes
with
only
verbal
instructions
.
Of
course
I
watched
their
videos
before
2019
started
.
I
got
the
Top
Fan
badge
on
Facebook
for
Bon
Appétit
for
the
first
time
on
November
28
,
2018
a
date
I
remember
vividly
and
have
listed
on
my
resume
under
accomplishments
and
awards
,
but
I
like
to
think
I
was
an
unofficial
top
fan
for
much
longer
.
That
said
,
Bon
Appétit
has
had
a
genuine
moment
this
year
,
with
longer
videos
,
more
frequent
uploads
and
even
several
new
series
like
Making
Perfect
and
Reverse
Engineering
.
A
passionate
,
wonderful
community
of
unofficial
content
has
sprouted
up
around
these
videos
meme
pages
,
merchandise
featuring
art
created
by
fans
and
even
a
Twitter
account
devoted
entirely
to
Claire
Saffitz’s
hair
.
All
this
creative
energy
,
centered
around
lovely
people
and
good
food
,
has
produced
one
of
the
most
wholesome
pockets
of
the
Internet
.
And
this
year
,
wholesome
was
exactly
what
we
all
needed
.
Bon
Appétit
has
made
the
worst
days
bearable
.
It
has
made
me
a
better
,
more
adventurous
cook
.
It
has
strengthened
old
friendships
and
forged
new
ones
with
group
chats
dominated
by
pictures
of
the
recipes
we
have
tried
crispy
saffron
rice
,
banana
bread
,
rigatoni
with
vodka
sauce
.
So
this
is
my
holiday
gift
to
you
a
Bon
Appétit
reading
list
,
for
every
occasion
and
emotion
.
The
days
are
growing
shorter
,
the
deadlines
are
piling
up
and
there’s
no
space
in
Perkins
right
now
anyways
.
Get
cozy
with
a
blanket
,
pour
a
cup
of
tea
,
hot
cocoa
or
wine
and
imagine
the
glamorous
life
you
will
live
once
you
can
afford
a
fully
functioning
kitchen
.
Here’s

I
recommend
watching

Brad
and
Claire
Make
Doughnuts
Part
2
.
The
subtitle
of
this
video
and
this
semester
is
The
Disaster
.
The
first
seven
minutes
are
complete
tomfoolery
,
followed
by
a
series
of
tragic
mistakes
and
misjudgments
.
It
is
absolutely
deranged
and
wildly
entertaining
,
and
I
take
comfort
in
the
fact
that
even
Brad
and
Claire
sometimes
have
no
idea
what
they’re
doing
.
In
years
like
this
,
full
of
heartache
and
fear
,
finding
moments
of
uncomplicated
,
unproblematic
,
unadulterated
can
feel
like
an
impossible
quest
.
This
world
is
hard
,
and
doesn’t
make
sense
,
but
I
have
never
had
a
bad
day
that
wasn’t
alleviated
by
watching
these
kind
,
brilliant
people
cook
and
laugh
together
.
No
YouTube
video
can
fix
the
mishap
that
was
2019
,
but
Bon
Appétit
makes
me
feel
hopeful
for
2020
.
For
now
,
that’s
enough
.
Last
year
when
I
was
interviewing
a
source
for
an
article
,
he
gestured
toward
me
while
saying
something
about
Chinese
.
I
swallowed
my
anger
.
I
am
not
Chinese
.
Growing
up
,
microagressions
and
even
straight
up
racism
were
normalized
for
me
.
I
often
recall
a
moment
in
fourth
grade
when
my
science
class
was
designing
a
food
web
.
One
student
put
human
above
cat
in
the
food
web
,
and
other
students
shouted
at
him
that
humans
don’t
eat
cats
.
Wait
a
minute
,
the
teacher
said
,
Some
people
do
eat
cats
right
Isabelle
?
She
looked
at
me
.
Everyone’s
eyes
followed
.
Cat
eater
,
small
eyes
,
always
Chinese
.
Never
mind
the
fact
that
I
was
born
in
America
and
my
parents
are
decidedly
Vietnamese
.
I
thought
that
these
things
would
stop
when
I
grew
older
.
Last
year
when
I
went
to
go
pick
up
a
paycheck
,
I
was
waiting
in
a
lobby
with
someone
else
.
That
person
asked
me
about
the
Great
Wall
of
China
had
I
ever
been
there
?
I
was
absolutely
bewildered
when
he
thought
he
could
just
ask
any
Asian
looking
person
on
the
street
about
China
,
as
if
we
were
Lonely
Planet
travel
guides
.
My
first
year
,
when
I
was
shopping
at
a
store
on
Ninth
Street
,
the
cashier
told
me
pointedly
about
the
Chinese
daughter
he
adopted
seven
years
ago
.
This
semester
,
while
I
studied
abroad
,
I
drunk
men
in
Rome
shouted
I
love
Chinatown
in
caricatured
accents
.
Strangers
in
London
greeted
me
with
ni
hao
.
Uber
drivers
told
me
that
I
looked
Chinese
.
Maybe
their
certainty
is
somewhat
better
than
all
the
times
that
people
thought
it
would
be
fun
to
try
and
guess
my
ethnicity
like
they
were
trying
a
mystery
Dum
Dum
flavor
.
At
some
point
during
my
college
career
,
I
realized
that
it
is
not
normal
to
brace
myself
for
a
comment
about
my
ethnicity
,
to
brace
myself
for
a
where
are
you
from
?
’
or
a
reference
to
something
something
China
.
When
I
hear
these
comments
or
see
these
things
,
it
reaffirms
my
sense
of
otherness
.
You
can
imagine
,
therefore
,
how
nice
it
is
to
write
an
anonymous
column
where
no
one
will
look
at
my
face
and
pass
a
judgement
.
I
wanted
to
write
just
to
write
,
because
this
is
one
of
the
few
ways
in
which
I
can
speak
and
people
will
listen
to
my
words
alone
.
And
what
a
pleasure
it
has
been
.
As
Monday
Monday
,
I’ve
been
able
to
try
new
formats
outside
of
the
usual
column
.
I’ve
been
able
to
write
a
quiz
and
old
timey
Fix
My
Campus
posts
;
I’ve
forced
The
Chronicle
to
publish
the
word
yak
and
narratives
from
the
perspective
of
grass
.
However
,
the
most
exciting
part
was
being
able
to
write
for
The
Chronicle
in
a
different
capacity
after
serving
three
years
on
the
news
staff
.
Leah
approached
me
about
applying
for
Monday
Monday
while
I
was
still
news
editor
.
Was
this
even
possible
?
Could
a
journalist
turn
into
a
humor
columnist
?

I
consulted
many
people
to
find
this
answer
.
People
like
Nathan
and
Cathy
were
ever
present
sounding
boards
for
my
ideas
and
jokes
.
Other
friends
found
out
along
the
way
like
Kevin
,
who
determined
that
only
I
would
write
a
tiny
love
story
about
Alex
O’Connell
but
encouraged
me
nonetheless
.
And
of
course
,
Leah
,
a
gem
of
an
editor
,
was
always
there
to
inject
extra
humor
into
whatever
I
wrote
.
So
the
answer
to
my
question
yes
,
I
could
.
I
love
to
write
and
I
love
to
tell
jokes
,
so
combining
the
two
was
natural
.
There
may
not
be
many
female
Asian
American
comedians
,
but
I
think
I
was
able
to
add
a
little
bit
to
that
space
.
And
I
know
that
for
every
humorous
effort
made
by
someone
like
me
,
it
is
somehow
met
with
an
equal
and
opposite
racist
force
.
Like
a
few
months
ago
,
when
Saturday
Night
Live
hired

So
I
understand

But
this
is
my
effort

I
will
be

,
and
I
will
simultaneously
be
met
with
the
racism
I
have
always
encountered
.
I
will
write

and
I
will
have
a

I
will
still
write
.
My
name
is
Isabelle
Doan

and
I’ve
enjoyed

Last
week
,
the
Duke
Student
Government
Senate
passed
a
resolution
that
urged
Duke
to
terminate
its
partnerships
with
Palantir
Technologies
with
the
immediate
aim
of
stopping
the
firm’s
recruitment
efforts
on
campus
.
This
action
by
the
DSG
Senate
while
perhaps
emotionally
satisfying
for
many
of
its
members
is
short
sighted
,
blatantly
partisan
in
nature
,
largely
uninformed
by
fact
,
and
unnecessarily
paternalistic
when
it
comes
to
dictating
the
employment
opportunities
of
Duke
students
.
While
I
can
understand
why
a
subset
of
students
here
take
issue
with
Palantir’s
specific
contracts
with
ICE
,
I
would
encourage
them
to
take
a
more
nuanced
approach
.
One
must
consider
the
entire
breadth
of
Palantir’s
work
and
,
in
the
aggregate
,
the
incredible
good
the
company
has
done
and
continues
to
do
.
Palantir
brings
much
needed
innovation
and
modern
software
solutions
to
some
of
the
most
pressing
problems
of
government
.
Software
developers
at
Palantir
have
immensely
aided
our
collective
national
security
.
Their
software
products
are
generally
held
in
high
regard
by
national
security
practitioners
and
especially
by
intelligence
analysts
.
Palantir
products
have
been
leveraged
by
the
U
.
S
.
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
to
detect
Medicare
fraud
,
by
the
FBI
in
criminal
probes
,
and
extensively
in
the
ongoing
global
war
on
terror
.
Even
more
recently
,
the
World
Food
Programme
has
partnered
with
Palantir
to
streamline
supply
chains
for
emergency
relief
operations
around
the
world
.
I
have
even
had
the
opportunity
to
use
Palantir
products
firsthand
during
a
summer
internship
and
they
are
simply
put
fantastic
.
We
ought
to
not
only
roundly
applaud
Palantir
for
this
work
,
but
we
should
recognize
how
and
why
some
of
our
fellow
students
may
want
to
work
for
the
firm
and
support
such
efforts
.
In
addition
,
on
campus
critics
of
Palantir
seem
to
be
suffering
from
misplaced
priorities
and
are
dishing
out
criticism
in
an
inconsistent
and
seemingly
hypocritical
manner
that
becomes
obvious
upon
looking
at
the
myriad
of
other
ICE
contractors
.
For
instance
,
a
band
of
activists
on
this
campus
,
while
small
in
number
but
disproportionately
loud
,
have
made
a
crusade
out
of
pursuing
Palantir
but
are
conveniently
silent
when
it
comes
to
other
firms
that
contract
with
ICE
several
of
whom
recruit
strongly
here
at
Duke
.
Here
are
a
couple
of
notable
firms
including
Palantir
for
reference
along
with
the
approximate
dollar
figure
of
their
cumulative
ICE
contracts

2010

I
presume
that
critics
of
Palantir
also
take
issue
with
the
efforts
of
Customs
and
Border
Patrol
CBP
as
well
.
So
,
I
have
taken
the
liberty
of
noting

of

While
I
find
the
DSG
Senate’s
efforts
towards
Palantir
to
be
misguided
in
the
first
place
,
I
would
at
least
ask
them
to
be
consistent
in
their
actions
and
avoid
hypocrisy
by
passing
similar
measures
aimed
at
the
above
named
firms
and
renouncing
their
desire
to
work
participate
in
recruiting
with
the
above
named
firms
.
I
am
not
holding
my
breath
.
I
have
heard
that
DSG
Senate
participation
looks
great
on
resumes
when
it’s
time
for
consulting
recruitment
.
Instead
,
I’ll
propose
an
alternative
,
more
probable
,
and
ultimately
sane
solution
individual
choice
and
responsibility
.
Duke
prides
itself
on
the
intelligence
and
free
thinking
of
its
student
body
.
Thus
,
it
is
reasonable
to
think
that
each
student
here
is
capable
of
deciding
for
themselves
if
they
want
to
work
for
a
firm
that
contracts
with
ICE
be
it
Deloitte
,
McKinsey
,
Dell
,
or
Palantir
.
In
other
words
,
we
should
allow
members
of
this
student
body
to
make
their
own
decisions
rather
than
preempt
them
with
particular
notions
of
social
justice
.
We
certainly
do
not
want
a
small
and
aberrant
minority
of
voices
to
dictate
the
employment
opportunities
available
to
the
entire
student
body
.
Thankfully
,
Michael
Schoenfeld
,
our
vice
president
for
public
affairs
and
government
relations
here
at
Duke
,
seems
to
agree
with
this
thinking
.
He
stated
in
an
email
to
The
Chronicle
in
October
that
Palantir
is
still
welcome
on
campus
and
that
students
can
and
should
be
able
to
make
their
own
choices
about
their
future
work
and
given
the
wide
range
of
backgrounds
at
Duke
,
we
should
expect
there
to
be
an
equally
wide
range
of
interests
.
The
DSG
Senate
would
be
wise
to
take
note
and
emulate
this
reasonable
stance
.
For
a
kleptomaniac
,
West
Union
is
likely
a
sensory
overload
.
Free
sauce
packets
,
dishware
,
and
napkins
sit
teasingly
on
the
counters
,
just
to
be
snatched
by
college
kids
on
a
budget
.
Duke
Dining
even
hosts
an
annual
Fork
Amnesty
Day
to
encourage
students
to
return
their
stolen
utensils
with
full
immunity
.
Message
to
pilferers
they’re
onto
us
.
On
the
one
hand
,
taking
things
let’s
call
them
supplies
from
West
Union
is
tolerated
.
There
are
no
video
cameras
trained
on
the
condiments
rack
and
no
security
guards
looking
over
our
shoulders
.
One
can
borrow
a
single
spoon
without
fear
of
condemnation
.
With
a
wink
and
a
nod
to
your
friends
,
you
can
walk
out
onto
the
quad
,
the
booty
tucked
away
in
your
bookbag
.
But
there
are
limits
.
If
this
borrowing
is
done
too
often
,
or
if
too
much
is
taken
,
it
becomes
unseemly
.
You
are
what
game
theorists
call
a
free
rider
,
using
more
than
your
fair
share
of
a
public
good
without
paying
.
Sure
,
you
fork
out
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
to
attend
Duke
,
but
that
doesn’t
entitle
you
to
raid
West
Union’s
fork
supply
.
Such
greed
and
selfish
behavior
results
in
a
tragedy
of
the
commons
,
or
a
depletion
of
the
public
good
.
It
is
why
Duke
Dining
had
to
order
a
whopping
9
,
000
extra
forks
for
the
new
school
year
.
Public
goods
are
an
amenity
that
makes
life
more
pleasant
and
tolerable
.
For
example
,
in
a
dormitory
,
each
resident
has
the
choice
to
be
selfish
or
sharing
.
Suppose
the
avid
baker
who
lives
down
the
hall
is
kind
enough
to
leave
a
sheet
of
cookies
in
the
common
room
for
anyone
to
enjoy
.
The
pleasant
aroma
,
as
well
as
the
sugar
high
,
makes
everyone
feel
a
bit
more
loved
and
valued
.
Then
imagine
a
stoner
grabs
the
entire
plate
,
just
minutes
after
it
is
shared
.
The
baker
will
be
a
little
less
generous
in
the
future
,
and
the
communal
spirit
vanishes
as
fast
as
the
plunderer
.
As
he
scurries
down
the
hall
,
he
deprives
his
neighbors
of
more
than
just
cookies
;
he
nabs
their
morale
.
Now
suppose
a
student
is
out
of
food
points
and
has
no
money
.
For
argument’s
sake
,
we’ll
assume
his
pocket
change
has
been
spent
on
toilet
paper
and
textbooks
,
not
a
case
of
White
Claws
or
JUUL
pods
.
With
a
chemistry
final
in
the
morning
,
the
student
is
in
desperate
need
of
a
touch
of
milk
for
coffee
to
get
through
tonight’s
grind
.
A
career
in
medicine
is
on
the
line
.
Surely
,
taking
a
little
milk
from
the
dining
hall
would
not
be
considered
looting
.
It’s
excusable
under
these
limited
circumstances
,
and
only
the
most
sanctimonious
person
would
call
it
out
.
In
the
end
,
the
ethics
of
taking
a
public
good
is
a
matter
of
common
sense
and
decency
.
Sometimes
things
just
feel
wrong
.
If
you
feel
the
need
to
be
furtive
,
don’t
do
it
.
Let
your
conscience
be
your
guide
.
In
recent
weeks
,
Duke
University
lost
a
giant
.
On
behalf
of
all
8
,
500
undergraduate
,
graduate
and
professional
black
alumni
of
Duke
University
,
we
mourn
the
loss
of
Wilhelmina
Reuben
Cooke
Trinity
,
’67
.
In
the
fall
of
1963
,
Reuben
Cooke
was
one
of
five
brave
black
students
who
entered
the
Trinity
College
of
Arts
of
Sciences
.
She
matriculated
alongside
Gene
Kendall
,
Nathaniel
Nat
White
,
Mary
Mitchell
Harris
and
Cassandra
Rush
,
thus
integrating
Duke
University’s
undergraduate
campus
.
This
decision
could
not
have
been
easy
.
Just
a
few
weeks
after
they
arrived
on
campus
,
a
church
bombing
in
Birmingham
,
Alabama
killed
four
little
girls
.
A
few
weeks
before
,
the
Reverend
Martin
Luther
King
delivered
his
iconic
I
Have
a
Dream
Speech
imploring
America
and
the
world
to
embrace
our
common
humanity
and
pursue
full
freedom
and
economic
justice
for
the
black
community
.
However
,
in
the
fraught
racial
climate
of
the
early
1960’s
,
success
and
even
their
personal
safety
at
a
prestigious
university
like
Duke
,
was
not
assured
.
Yet
,
during
her
Duke
career
,
Reuben
Cooke
thrived
.
She
was
elected
Phi
Beta
Kappa
and
was
named
a
Woodrow
Wilson
Scholar
.
Outside
the
classroom
,
she
was
active
in
the
local
civil
rights
movement
,
including
protesting
in
Durham
and
advocating
against
Duke
faculty
and
administrators
being
members
of
the
then
all
white
Hope
Valley
Country
Club
.
Reuben
Cooke
had
an
equally
distinguished
career
after
Duke
,
becoming
an
esteemed
patent
attorney
and
serving
two
terms
on
the
Duke
University
Board
of
Trustees
.
In
2011
,
Reuben
Cooke
earned
the
Distinguished
Alumni
Award
.
Beyond
her
accolades
and
trailblazing
example
,
however
,
many
of
us
knew
her
as
a
dear
friend
and
mentor
.
Duke
University’s
light
is
a
little
dimmer
,
but
the
power
of
her
courage
and
example
lives
on
.
Thank
you
for
your
sacrifice
to
Duke
and
blazing
the
trail
that
we
all
have
followed
.
